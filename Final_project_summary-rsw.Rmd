## Final Project Summary

This project explores how news media covered diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) topics during the first month of Donald Trump’s presidency, focusing on the differences between **domestic and international** newspaper coverage. More specifically, articles that discussed Trump's adminsitration dismantling federal DEI programs. I compiled a set of news articles using Nexis Uni, then cleaned and processed them for text analysis. In the Nexis Uni site, I narrowed the articles with Date: 01/20/25-02/20/25, Keyword: Diversity & Inclusion, Data Type: Newspaper Articles, and Language: English. This returned a total of 1916 articles to work with in my analysis. 

## Data Source

The original articles were retrieved from [Nexis Uni](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/professional/academic/nexis-uni.page?srsltid=AfmBOoqGISSgK0YqyAwokQTyWr6QDHbOBuuceMA_q0rxQarhYMv3pkI6).
The compiled and cleaned dataset used for this project is available on my laptop (files too large for Github-- need help pushing too large files to Github):

## Description of Data

The dataset includes articles published in the first month of Trump's 2025 presidency (Jan2025-Feb2025) containing keywords related to DEI and the Trump administration. It includes variables like publication name, publication country, date, full article text, and a binary variable that I added toindicate  whether the article is **domestic** or **international**, also a column of politically_leaning (which I haven't started to incorporate into my data analysis yet. Right now I am focusing on it from a international versue domestic standpoint, before looking at it through a political lens. 

## Content Analysis Plan

I plan to conduct a content analysis to compare how DEI-related issues were framed across domestic and international newspapers. I’ve created a **preliminary codebook**in my topic_modeling assignment  to identify topic themes such as:
- **Corporate DEI policies**
- **Education-related DEI**
- **Trump’s national politics**
- **Administrative orders**
- **Campus media coverage**

These categories are being developed based on the most frequent bigrams and common narrative themes. Preliminary coding involves using keyword matching and bigram frequency analysis to map patterns of coverage.

## Unit of Analysis

The unit of analysis is an individual news article. The content analysis will focus on three components within each article:
- The **publication_location**
- The **dom_vs_intl**
- The **political_leaning**

### Codebook (Preliminary Version)

| Code               | Definition                                                                 | Example                                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Tone_Positive      | Article uses language reflecting hope, resolution, or positive outcomes     | “Protesters call for reform, urge peaceful change”  |
| Tone_Negative      | Article uses alarmist or fear-inducing language                             | “Mob storms the Capitol in unprecedented violence”  |
| Dom_vs_intl        | Classifies the article as Domestic or International                         | Domestic (e.g. NYT), International (e.g. BBC)         |                 |
| Political_Affiliation | Implies alignment with a political ideology or party                     | “Left-wing activists confront right-wing group”     |

> _Note: Codebook is subject to refinement following further testing 

### Preliminary Work

-creating binary columns to perform content analysis on 
- Term frequency and bigram analysis were used to supplement theme identification, using packages such as `tidytext`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2` in R.
- Graphs were made to show the distribution of outlets via location (domestic vs international) and to show the top 20 bigrams 

## Sample of the Data

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(googledrive)
library(rio)
```

# Import Data from Google Drive

```{r}
googledrive::drive_deauth()
temp_file <- tempfile()
drive_download(as_id("1fexSMTg_wJOpyh_XCuc_3_2CP_FGS_tB"), path = temp_file)

#the file id is in the URL for your trump_dei_final_index.csv. which you get from clicking "Share on the Google Drive version and copying the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fexSMTg_wJOpyh_XCuc_3_2CP_FGS_tB/view?usp=sharing
#https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fexSMTg_wJOpyh_XCuc_3_2CP_FGS_tB/view?usp=sharing
#your file id: "1fexSMTg_wJOpyh_XCuc_3_2CP_FGS_tB"'

# Then import the downloaded file from your hard drive
dei_articles <- rio::import(temp_file, format = "csv") # If you know the file format, specify it explicitly..."csv" or "xlsx", "txt", etc.

```


##Number of columns and rows 

```{r}

print(paste0("This dataset has ", nrow(dei_articles), " rows and ", ncol(dei_articles), " columns."))

```

##Descriptive Statistics 

```{r}
summary(dei_articles)
```


 #frequency count for each category and their location 

```{r}
table(dei_articles$dom_vs_intl)
table(dei_articles$publication_location)

```


##adding categorizing columns such as dom_vs_intl to indicate whether the article is international or domestic and policial_leaning to identify blue and red states that the articles came out of
```{r}
dei_articles <- dei_articles |> 
 #mutating a new column to indicate whether the pub location is international or domestic 

mutate(dom_vs_intl = case_when (
  publication_location == "International" ~ "INTL",
  publication_location != "International" ~ "US",
  TRUE ~ NA
)) |>
## mutating a new column to indicate whether the state is blue or red 
mutate(political_leaning = case_when (
  publication_location == "Maryland" ~ "Blue", 
  publication_location == "Washington"~ "Blue", 
  publication_location =="California" ~ "Blue",
