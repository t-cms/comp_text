NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is bucking the current trend to abandon corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies following the inauguration of President .
Instead, Goodell is doubling down and has announced the league's continued support for DEI.

Per  Insider Tom Pelissero, "Roger Goodell says the  will continue its diversity efforts, despite the Trump administration's policies and companies dropping DEI programs: "Our efforts are fundamental in trying to attract the best possible talent into the , on and off the field."
Goodell issued a memo to the league's 32 teams on Saturday, announcing that the  will be reviewing all its DEI policies and initiatives.
The move comes amid ongoing concerns raised by former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores, who has filed a lawsuit against the league and several of its teams—specifically the Dolphins, Denver Broncos, and New York Giants—accusing them of racial discrimination.
This announcement arrives at a time when DEI is a hot-button issue in America.
Trump, a vocal opponent of DEI initiatives, has openly criticized efforts in this area. After a plane crash in Washington, D.C. on January 29 that killed 67 people, Trump and Defense Secretary  both blamed the Biden administration's focus on DEI as a factor in the tragedy. As the nation continues to debate the importance of DEI policies, the  has made it clear where it stands.
Speaking at his annual Super Bowl press conference in New Orleans, Goodell defended the league's ongoing DEI efforts.
"We're not in this because it's a trend," Goodell said. "It's about attracting the best talent."
He emphasized that the 's commitment to diversity is about more than just compliance with social trends—it's about creating an environment that draws in top-tier talent from all backgrounds.
"I think we'll continue those efforts," Goodell added.
The commissioner also underscored that the  is better for its diversity. While acknowledging that the league still has a long way to go, Goodell pointed to increased hiring of people of color and women both on and off the field.
"I believe that our diversity efforts have led to making the  better," he said.
This year's Super Bowl is a notable example of the league's progress, as it features two Black quarterbacks—Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs and Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles—in a repeat of the 2023 championship game.
Goodell used this as an illustration of how the  is benefiting from diversity, both in talent and leadership.
The 's DEI initiatives date back to 2003 when the league introduced the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview at least one candidate of color for head coaching positions.
The rule has since been expanded to cover a wider array of roles. In 2020, the  took its DEI commitment a step further by hiring Jonathan Beane as its first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. Under his leadership, the league has rolled out various programs aimed at promoting a racially and gender-diverse workforce.
Despite the 's efforts, recent months have seen a retreat from diversity programs in some major corporations, such as , , and Boeing.
These companies, under political pressure, have agreed to scale back or eliminate formal diversity initiatives.
Goodell, however, remained steadfast in his defense of the league's DEI programs. He elaborated, "Our rules and our policies are really designed around how do we increase the number of people that have an opportunity to have a career in the , including people of color and women. That's something we believe makes the  better. Those are processes to give our teams the chance to attract the best talent, and that's good for us."
Despite the 's commitment to diversity, the league still faces challenges when it comes to representation in leadership positions.
According to recent data, Black players make up 57.5% of  rosters, yet there is only one Black head coach in the league—Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Additionally, there are only two other ethnic minority head coaches—Robert Saleh of the New York Jets and Ron Rivera of the Washington Commanders.
The lack of diversity among head coaches has sparked continued conversation, particularly after the firing of David Culley, one of only three Black head coaches in 2021. Culley was let go after just one season with the Houston Texans, following a 4-13 record.
In his memo, Goodell made it clear that the 's DEI review will aim for "real and tangible results," underscoring the league's ongoing commitment to fostering diversity at every level.
"The best people are going into the league, and that's what's good for us," he said. While the road ahead may be long, the  has made it clear that its commitment to DEI is a central part of its vision for the future.
