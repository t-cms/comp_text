The following information was released by the office of Texas Rep. Al Green:
On Friday, January 31, 2025, Congressman Al Green will join Congressman Sylvester Turner at a pivotal press conference to illuminate the implications of President Trump's recent executive orders, which are set to transform not only Houston but the entire nation. This event will delve into topics such as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Education, the controversial rise in mass deportations, and much more. The press conference will be held at the Mickey Leland Federal Building (First Floor Conference Room) at 1919 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002, at 10:00 a.m. CT.
Congressman Al Green stated, "I am woke, Black Lives Matter, and the President's executive orders hurt. The executive orders enacted by President Trump serve only to fuel discord and upheaval in our society. It is imperative that we choose unity over division and actively challenge these disruptive actions. We must resolutely oppose any executive orders that threaten the integrity of our educational institutions and difficult truths about American history. Discrimination against law-abiding immigrant taxpayers or Americans born to non-American parents in this country is unacceptable, as is the dismantling of social justice initiatives such as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). We have made significant strides in our journey toward justice and equality we cannot allow these regressive policies to undermine the progress we have achieved together. Stay woke!"
