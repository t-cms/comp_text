The following information was released by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville:
Last week, Senator Tuberville joined Senator Eric Schmitt (R-MO) and Congressman Michael Cloud (R-TX) to introduce theDismantle DEI Act, which codifies President Trump's executive actions terminating DEI programs and initiatives, preventing future administrations from reinstating similar Biden-era DEI policies.
"We must wash our hands of DEI,"said Senator Tuberville."Joe Biden and Kamala Harris nearly destroyed the fabric of our country with this woke, racist ideology. We need to focus on hiring the best and brightest, not dividing people based on skin color.Thank God President Trump is restoring merit-based hiring practices to our government.Now Congress must do our job to ensure that this poisonous ideology has no place in our government."
"DEI has plagued our federal government, academic institutions, and other aspects of our society for far too long, all while disregarding merit in the process. America is the greatest meritocracy the world has ever seen, and no taxpayer dollars should be wasted on funding this divisive ideology which undercuts the values our country was founded on. President Trump understands that these programs have absolutely no business in the federal government, and I am proud to introduce this critical legislation with Congressman Cloud that will save taxpayer dollars and put a stop to this DEI madness,"said Senator Schmitt.
BACKGROUND:
On January 20, 2025, President TrumpsignedExecutive Order 14151, "Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing." This executive action terminates diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and initiatives throughout all federal departments and agencies, while also compiling a list of those federal contractors and grantees associated with those same programs.
President Trump helped reverse many of the Biden administration's priorexecutive actionson DEI programs.
TheDismantle DEI Acthelps build on the President's agenda by:
Ensuring all DEI offices are terminated and prohibiting agencies from renaming or repurposing them to continue the same functions under new titles.
Barring federal funds from being used for DEI training, grants, or programsincluding identity-based quotas and critical race theory.
Granting individuals the legal right to challenge any of these violations in court.
