Today, U.S. Representative John Garamendi (D-CA-08) released the following statement in response to President Donald Trump's response to the Aviation crash at Ronald Regan International Airport:
"My heart goes out to the families of the 67 people who tragically lost their lives last night. President Donald Trump blaming the tragedy of the American Airlines accident on DEI is shameful and irresponsible," said Rep. Garamendi. "Instead of waiting for the investigation of this tragedy and assuring the American people that incidents like this fatal airplane crash would never happen again, President Trump politized this tragedy. I am deeply concerned that the President's response had no sympathy for the victims, no assurances to the American people of a thorough investigation, and that he did not display an ounce of responsible statesmanship. I know that the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the military are conducting a thorough and nonpolitical investigation into this accident, producing recommendations to ensure this tragedy never happens again."
