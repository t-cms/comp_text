New polling suggests that Democrats have a major problem with their voter stronghold, and it's clear they have no idea how to fix it.
In 2022, legendary Democrat strategist and pollster Stanley Greenberg  that Democrats were out of touch with middle-class blue-collar workers. He warned that if the party doesn't change how it approaches these voters, Democrats face losing this vital demographic during election season.
Greenberg's warnings were prophetic. Blue-collar workers overwhelmingly  President Donald Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election, which won them the trifecta of political power in Washington, D.C. However,  from CBS News shows that Democrats aren't just bleeding support from blue-collar workers but another demographic they have been courting for decades: Gen Z.

Trump's new  show he is more favorable than ever, mainly due to his rising support among Gen Z voters. In the under-30 category, 55 percent of Gen Z voters approved Trump's first 20 days in office. For decades, Democrats have been pursuing the young vote as a long-term strategy to overwhelm the Boomer vote, which typically skews toward Republicans.
However, the Democrats' approach to this voter bloc is clearly failing to take root. In fact, they are swinging in the opposite direction, likely due to Trump's quick action since taking back the White House. Over 60 percent of Gen Z respondents described Trump as “effective,” “focused,” “energetic,” and “tough.” 
The polling shows that most Americans overwhelmingly support Trump's plan to stop and reverse illegal immigration, which Democrats let balloon out of control over the last four years. Over half of Gen Z voters told pollsters that Trump is either focusing on deporting illegal immigrants the right amount or not enough. The majority of these voters want the Democrats' open border system to end.
They also support his policies on cutting taxes, government spending, and imposing tariffs on foreign countries.
 These are Trump's best approval numbers ever. But look at the generational breakdown.
 Boomers are 50/50. Millennials are +4.
 Gen Z is +10.
 I'll keep saying it: Zoomers are going to be the most right-wing generation in recent memory.

Still, probably the biggest knife to the heart of Democrats is Gen Z's overwhelming disapproval of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. While 36 percent of young voters believe Trump is focusing too much on ending DEI programs, a whopping 63 percent said he needs to keep going at this speed or go even further to root it out. 
It's not a secret that Democrats put a heavy emphasis on promoting DEI as the new American Dream. The party promoted this ideology as our country's chance to pay reparations for its so-called racist history. But the younger generations are no longer falling for the insidious charade. They've watched as colleges and employers used DEI as a cuddle to deny them entry into their world. These programs hurt them in tangible ways, and they resent the party that continues to push them to accept it as gospel.
 Gen Z for Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump...
 We registered 750+ new Gen Z voters at this campus event last week.

In order to change their trajectory, Democrats will have to end their relationship with the far-left wing of their party. So far, despite their overwhelming loss in November, it doesn't seem that Democrats have learned this lesson.
In the party's recent campaign event to elect a new leader, the candidates blamed the 2024 election loss on racism and misogyny. It couldn't have been because former Vice President Kamala Harris represented the type of Democrat that wants to continue open border, DEI, and anti-American sentiment. No, her loss had to have been because Americans are racist and hate women.
The only issue that Trump currently struggles with among voters is the everyday costs Americans endure when filling their fridges and gas tanks. This is understandable, considering prices haven't improved since the November election, and the economy was a top priority for voters in 2024. 
However, Americans saw what Trump was able to accomplish under his first administration. He has been in office less than a month, and the expectation is that he will tackle the failing economy with as much gusto as his first four years. If he successfully reduces everyday costs, his approval rating will likely only get higher.
 NEW: CNN's Harry Enten blown away by Trump's popularity surge 
 “Holy smokes. I mean, look at what the difference is between now versus eight years ago ... You go back to 2017, Trump was already underwater at -5 points in the net approval rating ... What a difference eight... 
 - Jason Cohen  (@JasonJournoDC) 
Right now, the game is Trump's to lose. They not only want him to continue his march through the federal government, ending illegal immigration, DEI, and corrupt spending, but they want more of it. If Republicans continue winning Gen Z votes at the rate they did in 2024, Democrats have little chance when the 2026 midterms roll around.
