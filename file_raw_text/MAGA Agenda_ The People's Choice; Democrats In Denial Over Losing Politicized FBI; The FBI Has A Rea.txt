BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: -- took down the Soviets, there'll be hockey game tonight, remember that, for nations. Remember, if you can't catch us live, set your DVR. 06:00 p.m. in the East, 03:00 p.m. on the West Coast. You can follow me on Instagram and X @bretbaier. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for Special Report. Fair, balanced and unafraid. Here's Laura.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I run again. You tell me, there is your controversy right there. There is your controversy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: The fun never ends. The MAGA vortex, billions of waste being exposed, illegals being shipped out, and maybe even a DOGE dividend.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy, Chainsaw.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And they could use that chainsaw over at the EPA, because it turns out someone was getting a lot of dough for doing a lot of nothing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a high achiever, but in a different way than a lot of my fellow students. There were things I was supposed to want that I didn't.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I said -- Secretary Lee Zeldin will share the latest budget insanity, but first, history in a month. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.
One month of Trump 2.0 and a whirlwind of success.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: OK, that solves that problem.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Today, senior White House staff gave a quick recap.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The President has already signed 73 executive orders, that is more than double the number signed by Joe Biden and more than quadruple the number signed by Barack Obama over the same period.
STEPHEN MILLER, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Thank you all for joining today our one month celebration of the most historic opening to a presidency in American history. He has ended all DEI across the federal government, terminated all federal workers involved in promulgating these unlawful policies. He has restored merit as the cornerstone of all federal policy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And if you're a criminal alien terrorizing Americans or an NGO that's been profiting off our open borders, your life over the past month suddenly got a lot more challenging. Deportations are sending a strong message of deterrence, and Biden streamlined 15 million illegals, remember, into the country, paroled millions more. So Trump, look, has his work cut out for him, But day-by-day, they're making a lot of progress, and much more is being planned, including legal action against mayors who insist on protecting criminal illegals, so don't interfere with ICE, ICE, baby.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM HOMAN, BORDER CZAR: I'm happy the numbers are up. I'm happy with the results so far. I am not satisfied. I will not be satisfied to every gang member, every illegal alien gang member, every illegal alien public safety threat and national security threat eradicate in this country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: More on this coming up later in the show. But seriously, you just got to love the media reaction to the last month. Trump has reshaped everything from the workings of America's federal government to its relations with allies and foes overseas, from its approach to war and peace, to its stances on trade and foreign aid, he shows no sign of slowing down.
And Axios says Trump succeeding the wildest dreams of his supporters and the darkest nightmares of his detractors, conceding that Trump is historically popular. Of course, what actually has their head spinning is the return of basic accountability to D.C., because for decades, progressives have benefited from wasteful federal grants that fund radical agendas on race, on gender and open borders. But those days they're over.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELON MUSK, CEO, X: We've got this truly absurd, a Do Not Pay list, which can take up to a year before an organization to get on a Do Not Pay list. We're talking about terrorist organizations. We're talking about known fraudsters, known aspects of waste, known things that do not match any congressional appropriation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: This is why they hate Elon Musk. The gravy train is coming to a screeching halt.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MILLER: He has undertaken a historic cost cutting effort across the federal government, uncovering corruption on a scale that we never thought imaginable, and already saving $50 billion in a single year, which over a 10 year period would be $500 billion just think about how vast and enormous that sum is.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: You know the song, "who let the dogs out?" Well, every day, liberals have been running to court to keep the DOGE out and the illegals in. But the results of their lawfare have been mixed. Nevertheless, Democrats are slowly getting back on their feet. But are they really convincing anyone?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Why does our own government want to turn against our own people? It's a scandal. It's a disgrace. In 2025, a rally a day keeps the fascists away. OK.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Meanwhile, Trump is in a great mood, much to the horror of the war hawks, he's pursuing peace in Ukraine.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing of potentially additional millions of people. The soldiers are being just wiped out on both sides, wiped out. It's horrible.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And today was even sweeter when his nominee to head the FBI Kash Patel not only won confirmation, but all of Trump's cabinet nominees have been confirmed. Now it's not just the GOP that's more united and changing. The country seems to be changing too.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump and the Republican Party has changed the electorate. Let's take a look at party identification. Democrats versus Republicans. You go back to 2017, five points more of the electorate was Democrats than Republicans. Look at what's happened in February of 2025, look at this, Republicans, there are more Republicans in the electorate than there are Democrats. Republican plus two.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: 30 days in, and Americans are grateful, including at the White House today, at a celebration for Black History Month.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President has been an honor of a lifetime to support you, to try to wake up as many people to the lies of the Democrat Party and the non-stop manipulation of the mainstream media. We pray for you, we continue to pray for you and we're thankful for your service and your sacrifice.
TRUMP: We love you all. We're going to work with you. We're going to make America greater than ever before. We're going to do it together.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It's only one month, and anything can happen. But I am extremely impressed by Trump's team, their discipline, their devotion to the America First agenda. Now, of course, there are going to be bumps in the road. So no one can be perfect, and I'm keeping an eye on how they deal with China, but I am very optimistic.
Now, in the coming months, we're going to hear a lot of vicious accusations from the Left, a lot of, he's a dictator type garbage. We're going to see frivolous lawsuits. There's going to be some setbacks from activist judges. But for now, like you, I'm just thoroughly enjoying every day because this is history, my friends. And that's the Angle.
Joining me now, National Security Advisor to the Trump administration, 30 days in, is Mike Waltz. Mr. Advisor, I want to talk to you about what's happening with the Democrat Party and the concern about Donald Trump pursuing peace, which is what he campaigned on.
MIKE WALTZ (R), NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Yes, isn't it a little odd, Laura, that the same party that has been pounding the table and waving their hands in the air for a ceasefire, demanding it, including Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, what have you. And Gaza is now completely opposed to President Trump being the president of peace and ending the war in Ukraine. I mean, it's just, it's non-sensical. And I think it's just let's suppose all things President Trump is trying to do.
What did I say today at the press conference with our great Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. Who in the world is against peace? He is determined to drive both of these parties to the negotiating table. He is determined to apply diplomacy and only President Trump, as said by Putin on the call, and as said by Zelenskyy on the call, back-to-back calls could get it done. We had a follow-up meeting in Riyadh, hosted by the Saudis to talk to the Russians and talk about how to get this war over with.
Meanwhile, the killing fields continue. Zelenskyy needs to sign this economic partnership with the United States. It's an incredible opportunity for him and for the future of Ukraine. And once we get a ceasefire in place, we can get all of these things done.
INGRAHAM: Now, Senator Ruben Gallego, sir, shared his thoughts about what President Trump said about Zelenskyy the other day. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ): He's more willing to be bullies to our friends than to actual bullies, because he's a weak man at the core. He's afraid of people like Putin, because Putin is an actual strong man. So that's the way that he operates as bullies. He goes after people that are tend to be friends who are going to react to him in a more, I would say, lenient way, real bullies he is afraid of.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So saying that Donald Trump is weak for wanting to pursue peace and genuinely being concerned about the suspension of civil liberties in Ukraine, obviously, the Orthodox Church, all the things we know that Zelenskyy has done, some of it popular. A lot of it is not. Your reaction tonight to this?
WALTZ: Well, I would just remind him and others that Putin invaded, excuse me, his neighbor under President Bush, Georgia under Obama, Ukraine in 2014, not under President Trump, and then again under Biden. So Putin is clearly emboldened by perceived weakness and deterred by strength, and he understands President Donald J. Trump will go toe-to-toe with him, with Xi, with Kim Jong-un or anyone else.
But President Trump also prefers diplomacy. He prefers -- I mean this is just like the Democrats turned completely upside down. When did they become the party continuing a war that by all accounts was endless, had settled into a brutal, destructive stalemate with no end in sight, costing the entire world blood and treasure to -- again, Biden had no theory of victory. President Trump does, and that's the plan we're putting in place.
INGRAHAM: Mr. Waltz, another concern is that and the President has said, you know, all hell would basically rain down on Hamas if all the hostages weren't released. Well, they're releasing some dead hostages, Hamas, with those hideous videos circulating on the internet of Hamas parading through the streets with the coffins of children and their mother. I mean, it's just the most depraved evil thing you can imagine. But what can we expect more from this administration, given the fact that these hostages still, all of them, some have, but many still have not been released.
WALTZ: Well, Laura, and I'll just let everyone know that sadly and tragically, we thought that that family perhaps had been killed by an errant bombing. In fact, we now know that Hamas executed them. These are twin children. These are babies. These are -- this was their mother. This is a sick terrorist organization, no different than ISIS, and we cannot have Gaza ruled by a terrorist organization. Hamas has to be destroyed.
We'll continue to enter into some type of negotiation to get as many hostages out. But the end of the day, Gaza will be ruled by Hamas no more, who has repeatedly said their full intent is to have more October 7th, more attacks. They fully intend to continue to attack Israel, if allowed to remain in place, and we stand with Israel in making sure that doesn't happen.
INGRAHAM: Well, I mean, the idea that they could continue to live there, we don't have the video of some reason, but it's most depressing, depraved video of Hamas and children clapping at the bodies of these small children being removed from where they were being kept. I mean, applauding, clapping, cheering. That's who we're dealing with. That's what they've done to their children in Gaza. And the idea that any of these people could remain is ludicrous, completely ludicrous.
WALTZ: But let's even go back, rewind the clock back last year, when you had people in our college campuses chanting from the river to the sea, the antisemitism that we saw naked and bear in front of the world, and cheering on an organization that would do things like this, a terrorist group that has radicalized the next generation as well. So this is, I mean, this is a complex issue, but what is crystal clear is Hamas has got to go. Their leadership has to go. And we are -- we are working with the Israelis to do just that.
INGRAHAM: Mike, as always, thank you very much. All right, just ahead, Democrats hold the most, well, perhaps, could it be the most pathetic protest so far? It's a tough competition, but this may actually win the award, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: OK, the party of part of partial birth abortion, pro-Hamas protesters and gender mutilation of children doesn't talk about evil very much unless they're talking about a Trump nominee.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kash Patel, mark my words will cause evil in this building behind us, and Republicans who vote for him will rue that day.
SEN. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):No one is a bigger or more dangerous sycophant than Kash Patel. This political hack does not deserve to be in this building.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not a distraction. This is a real danger and a real threat.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Danger? No, they're not only bad political leaders, they're bad actors. Patel's confirmation vote was a stern and beautiful rebuke of the Left for its weaponization of the DOJ and the FBI against Donald Trump and conservatives. But Schiff's sweating not because Patel will be ineffective. He's sweating because the new FBI Director is promising investigations into the corruption that's rocked public confidence in the FBI.
Now, remember Biden doled out a lot of preemptive pardons. Remember those? Remember Schiff actually got one.
Joining me now is Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. Senator, why-o-why is Adam Schiff so worried about Kash Patel?
SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Adam Schiff is afraid of the truth because he's a habitual liar. Talk about a political hack. He is one, but now he's unfortunately a U.S. senator, but I fully expect Kash Patel, first of all, to be transparent, which obviously FBI, Department of Justice was not under President Biden. The American people deserve the truth, and we're going to work very closely with Kash Patel to give the American people the truth, to expose all the corruption, the partisanship within the FBI, maybe even the Department of Justice.
This can't go on. We're going to return integrity, restore integrity the FBI, that is Kash's mission. That's what he told me prior to his confirmation hearing. He wanted to return credibility, integrity to the FBI. He'll send agents out to the field, make prosecutorial decisions out there, outside the politics of Washington, D.C., return to a single system of justice, one for all Americans.
INGRAHAM: Well, I mean Hunter Biden, the Biden gravy train. I mean all the things that we know were given short shrift by the previous administration. Again, remember their pardons. They just sprinkle the pardons around and again, including Adam Schiff got a pardon. Why? But Democrats are still lying, Senator, about what Trump really wants here. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. PETER WELCH (D-VT): Kash Patel is a crown jewel in this lawless rampage. He's an instrument of Donald Trump's effort to destroy the Justice Department and the FBI, he willingly agrees to carry out the vengeance tour of Donald Trump,
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Senator, the Vengeance tour, isn't he describing exactly what the Biden administration did and before that, the Obama administration.
JOHNSON: This is the well-worn strategy of the political Left. They falsely accuse their political opponents of doing exactly what they do in orders of multitude worse. No, they are brazen. They are hypocrites. They were rejected at the polls. They still haven't got their feet underneath them that they're not quite sure what happened to them. What's going to happen to them, though, is the truth is going to be exposed across the board, throughout these government agencies. That's why they're screaming so loud with Elon Musk and DOGE exposing all the waste, fraud and abuse within their government. They are the party big government. They use big government to fund their radical Left ideology. Hopefully that's coming to an end.
INGRAHAM: Well, a lot of folks who are watching this, first of all, they're enjoying it thoroughly, because the Democrats are back on their heels, but they're worried also that executive orders, while they're great, they can be undone by an opposing administration. So all of that spending presumably could come back if Congress allowed it to come back. I mean, the Congress allowed this to go on as well, refusing to stop funding a lot of these agencies. But so how does some of this get made permanent rather than temporary?
JOHNSON: Well, we have the reconciliation process. I think you're aware of the fact that I've proposed four options to bring spending to a pre- pandemic level somewhere between $5.5 trillion and $6.5 trillion that's going to defund an awful lot of the deep state. But we start with that. We also have the Congressional Review Act, which is a very powerful act. Some of these regulations that have been acted within a certain timeframe, we can undo. We can remove them, and they can't come back.
A future president, future Democrat, can't put in place those same regulations again when we remove them, repeal them under Congressional Review Act. So we need to be very aggressive. There's, I think, more than 50 that are available. We need to be very aggressive about using the Congressional Review Act as well.
INGRAHAM: Well, another thing that people are very concerned about is, of course, Anthony Fauci, again, received a pardon. But given what happened during COVID, given the lies that we're told about the origins of COVID, the cooperation with the EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan lab, perhaps we even maybe had a hand in funding the very research that led to this pandemic. Will Congress and the FBI have a responsibility to really put the truth out about that?
JOHNSON: That would probably be my top priority as the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee Investigation. We need to uncover the truth, the corruption of these federal health agencies and in particular Anthony Fauci, Francis Collins, what do they know? When do they know it? How many lies they tell the American public? I will hold them accountable. And that pardon is a double-edged sword for them, because now they have no protection, the Fifth Amendment denying not being willing to testify fully and truthfully. So I fully intend to get the full truth exposed in terms of Anthony Fauci and these federal health agencies.
INGRAHAM: Yes, as he enjoys his time wherever he is, so is he at Georgetown, I believe. They always fail upward, Senator. As always, thank you so much.
JOHNSON: Have a great night.
INGRAHAM: All right, the EPA and Stacey Abrams, what? How does she end up getting money? Climate change, slush fund? Well, Lee Zeldin, the head of the EPA has the information for us, and he's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Republicans are gutting agency after agency. Then you add the CDC, the EPA, HUD. Taking away those who work to make our lives better only makes sense if you think we don't need prevention from pandemics, pollution, or to, I don't know, answer to an affordable housing crisis.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Stacey Abrams is very worried. She's worried about these agencies, I'm sure don't waste any of your money. She's worried about them getting DOGED. Well, maybe it's because she was profiting from the EPA. The agency has discovered $2 billion awarded by the Biden administration to, quote, "power forward communities." It's a nonprofit that partnered with multiple left-wing groups founded by Abrams.
Joining us now, the E.P. head himself, Lee Zeldin. All right, Mr. Administrator, can you explain what the heck happened here and how another slush fund has been exposed?
LEE ZELDIN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: So, this is two billion dollars of that 20 billion that was parked at this bank outside of government towards the end of the Biden administration. Power Forward Communities, which Stacey Abrams is part of, only received $100 in 2023. They then got two billion dollars in this grant in 2024.
Now I was just reading over the grant agreement, Laura, on the first page it gives the organization, this nonprofit, 21 days to distribute $2 billion. But this is the crazy part. I went to page seven of the grant agreement and it's giving the entity 90 days to complete a training called, How to Develop a Budget.
Now, I would say that if an organization needs to take a training on how to develop a budget, one they should be taking the training before they're spending a dollar, but they definitely shouldn't be getting two billion.
INGRAHAM: She's quite something, right? She loses in Georgia, and then she goes on to be a -- she's really an aggregator of fraud and corruption in the fact, if this is how you view government, it's just a place where you can reward your friends and fund your pet projects and call them green, and then everyone feels good about it.
But the Citibank accounts where this money was held, has that money itself been now frozen? Is there actual fraud, do you think, in these payments or was it just the usual nonsense they were pulling at the end of an administration?
ZELDIN: The entire scheme as set up is fraud, it's wasteful, it is abuse. We just had another example come out over the last 24 hours where $5 billion went to another recipient. That person was the director of the greenhouse gas reduction fund. He comes from this fund, joins the Biden administration, becomes the director of the greenhouse gas reduction fund, and then gave $5 billion to his recently left former employer.
That sounds like self-dealing. That sounds like a conflict of interest. And the other problem is that all of this money was put up a front. It wasn't like there was performance. You show performance, then you ask for the next tranche. It was here's $20 billion.
And it was going to their friends on the left, as opposed to making sure that the money is going directly towards the purpose that you allegedly said this money was needed for in the first place.
If you care about clean air, land and water, if you think there's some community that's been left behind, then why aren't you spending the dollar actually remediating that issue instead of paying off your friend?
INGRAHAM: Well, Lee, we have Rosa DeLauro, Murray, Merkley, all these lefties now demanding answers from you. They say your cuts, your spending cuts, your freezes of spending are going to devastate programs that provide clean drinking water and other important environmental, you know, help to people in need. But they're really laying it on thick in Congress, specifically about what you're doing.
ZELDIN: I'm not going to waste a penny. I'm at zero tolerance. And Congress should want me to ensure that there's accountability and oversight. The way the agreements were written, when the money goes through the eight primary recipients, eight primary recipients receiving $20 billion as a pass-through, when it goes to the subgrantees the EPA isn't even a party to those account control agreements.
The EPA actually put in writing that we would have less oversight and accountability, and many of those subgrantees are also pass-throughs. The members of Congress, they should all be outraged. They should be upset that tax dollars are getting squandered as opposed to trying to make me want to just close my eyes and allow us to play out. We're not going to allow it to happen. The Trump administration has zero tolerance for this.
INGRAHAM: I love how they're demanding answers from you. You're demanding answers from them. I can't wait to see how this all plays out. Lee, thank you very much. All right, Trump's also cleaning house at the IRS. Of course, that's the left's most cherished bureaucracy. Nearly 7,000 IRS bureaucrats were fired today, and the left has been in a total meltdown over their fate.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Internal Revenue Service is also one of the hyper efficient federal government agencies by far. It is the agency which makes money for the federal government. The truth is the IRS costs zero.
UNKNOWN: If we're cutting staff at the IRS, that means your payment and your refund will not get processed in a timely manner.
UNKNOWN: It's tax season and they're also looking to not just access IRS systems, but also potentially lay off IRS workers there. I mean, this is a full-scale assault on government and it's going to have impact.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Remember Biden's 80,000 agents? Well, the IRS just doesn't cost zero. It's spent over $16 billion in fiscal year 2023. And again, the Biden administration moved to hire, what, it was 20,000 new employees, $80 billion to improve tax enforcement, meaning more targeting of hardworking Americans.
Joining us now, Grant Cardone, Cardone Capital CEO and fund manager. Grant, they are so upset about these cuts. Why are they so worried?
GRANT CARDONE, CEO, CARDONE CAPITAL: Well, because they're thieves. These are parasites on the American people. It's a Ponzi scheme. They collect five trillion. I think the American people don't understand the IRS and what they actually do. They collect $5 trillion a year from American people, mostly not corporations, American people, regular middle-class people, those super wealthy, have figured out how to get by it.
Fifty percent of that money is from income taxes, OK. It's taken literally, you know, $2.5 trillion away from the American people. $1.8 trillion comes from withholding. And then 10 percent, Laura, listen to this, 10 percent are penalties, $500 billion a year, the American people are charged by the IRS for penalties alone. We should get rid of the IRS. We should go to a zero tax.
First of all, audit the IRS and you will get rid of them because the amount of fraud there is unbelievable. We should go to a zero tax, and then win the American people for some situation, whether it's the military or whatever, needs money, we print money.
Right now, we do both. We print and we tax. We should do one or the other, and I would say print, and make sure the American people are behind it. Otherwise, don't tax the American people.
INGRAHAM: Well, you can actually, it turns out, you could get a DOGE check with all this savings sometime soon. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Elon Musk is proposing potentially giving money to Americans based on what DOGE is finding. Do you have any thoughts on that?
DOANLD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I love it. At 20 percent dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse.
UNKNOWN: How much money do you think it could be?
TRUMP: Could be a lot. I mean, if it's 20 percent, we'd give back a lot of money to the taxpayer.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, Grant, this is the people's money, so calling it a DOGE dividend is kind of fun, but it's their money. It's our money.
CARDONE: Well, you know what's crazy is that the withholding, for instance, everybody gets withheld for 26 weeks of the year if you're getting paid every two weeks. They say the reason they do the withholding is for the convenience of the American people.
And then one of the people that you were talking about in the video, they said it makes it easier for people to budget. It's a convenience. I'm like, I'm not getting a refund. If you get rid of 7,000 IRS people, and they can't process my refund, by the way, that was not a refund. That was money I should have never paid. I was overpaid to the IRS.
If that money alone stayed with the American people, it would be $81 billion a year that I could earn by having money at the bank rather than sitting with the IRS and maybe going to Ukraine.
INGRAHAM: It's criminal. It's criminal that we spent a trillion dollars a year on interest on our debt. It's criminal that we spent trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's -- I mean, it really is criminal. It's stealing from the American people and our children our grandchildren.
And speaking of stealing, Grant, what about Fort Knox? Do you think that gold's all in there, a few gold bars missing maybe?
CARDONE: One or two things are going to happen. Either they're going to find nothing in there and that's going to be a disaster, or they're going to find too much gold in there, because maybe go back a couple of years and maybe they've been packing some gold in there from other countries.
Neither one is explainable, but the American people deserve to know what the truth is. And the American people can handle the truth. Let's get down to it and stop the nonsense of these Ponzi schemes and parasites.
INGRAHAM: Do you think there should be any tax, flat tax, fair tax, sales tax?
CARDONE: I think there should be no income tax, no death or inheritance tax, no gift tax, there should be no income tax at all, no payroll withholding. The way to do it is to go to a flat tax. People would pay 20 to 25 percent on a purchase. That's when it would be collected.
And if a local state or county wants to add a property tax, let them do that. It shouldn't be the federal government.
INGRAHAM: Grant, people across the country are applauding that. Sounds good to me. Grant, thank you so much. Come back soon.
CARDONE: And print money when you need it. If you need it, print it.
INGRAHAM: Print money when you need it. All right, illegals free ride coming to a screeching halt. And that's happening next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: All right, Democrats, they're running on empty. The American people overwhelmingly support deporting illegals. By the way, I think truth be told, I think it's -- they want more deportation. Not enough just to do the violent criminals. But what do the Democrats say in response? Well, JB Pritzker is one of the premier governors for the Democrats in the United States. This is what he has to offer.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: What comes next? After we've discriminated against, deported, or disparaged all the immigrants, and the gay and lesbian and transgender people, the developmentally disabled, the women and the minorities, once we've ostracized our neighbors and betrayed our friends, after that, when the problems we started with are still there staring us in the face, what comes next?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Chad Wolf, former acting DHS secretary joins me now. Chad, they're back to the same old scaremongering. The American people have made it clear in poll after poll that they want illegals deported. And they want more illegals deported than are currently being deported, not just the criminal gangs, but everybody who's here illegally. And that's it? That's what they have in response?
CHAD WOLF, FORMER ACTING DHS SECRETARY: Well, you're exactly right. The American people have spoken and they want illegal aliens removed from this country. And that's, of course, what President Trump and Tom Homan and the Department of Homeland Security are doing. Look, those comments from the governor are ridiculous. They're ridiculous comments from a ridiculous governor. And we've seen this play out time and time again. I have no idea what he's talking about. That's actually not reality.
And to your point, Laura, it's just trying to scare the American people. The American people, though, are very different environment than they were the first time President Trump was in office, they understand what the media is doing, they don't believe left-wing politicians like the governor, and they trust President Trump to keep them safe and secure.
INGRAHAM: Well, what's incredible about all of this is that the cost per illegal is now estimated to be about $130,000 to keep them in the United States. Now most people across the country hear that sum and they think, well, wait a second, wait a second, I don't make anywhere near $130,000. And yet, we're supposed to keep the federal benefits going that are in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
So, Donald Trump said no in that executive order. Those federal benefits are over. Do you think that's going to be upheld in court?
WOLF: I do, because what President Trump is doing is just instituting the law, right? There's a law from 1996 that says these illegal aliens should not be getting public benefits, and the Biden administration skirted that with parole and everything else that they gave them over these four years. And so, President Trump is actually trying to implement what Congress passed and implement the law. And so, I think they will be successful.
INGRAHAM: Chad, thank you so much as always. And Democrats think screaming into a microphone is actually going to stop Trump.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: AOC is instructing unelected bureaucrats on how to defy the mandate President Trump has to shrink the size of the federal government.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: When we are sitting down and they try to storm these offices and dismiss people, the key here, make them. Make them show a warrant, make them show a document, make them assert their authority, ask them who are you? They're no one. He's running around because he thinks he's got a bank account with a lot of zeros in it, that it makes him some kind of super citizen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: New York Governor Kathy Hochul is also having a bit of a difficult time about this photo that the White House tweeted out today saying, congestion pricing is dead. Manhattan and all of New York is saved. Long live the King.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: President Donald Trump tweeted, long live the King. I'm here to say, New York hasn't labored under a king in over 250 years. And we are not, sure as hell, I'm not going to start now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, joining me now, Mollie Hemingway, Fox News contributor, editor in chief of The Federalist, and Alex Marlow, Breitbart editor in chief. Molly, let's start with you. What's wrong with Kathy Hochul?
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Just in general, it's hard to be a Democrat right now. They do not have many positions of authority, and the ones they have don't seem to be going well. But when you see something like that, you think maybe we just need to do a rudimentary course in metaphor, you know, where they can understand that they don't need to get outraged over every little turn of phrase, and maybe focus more on proper governance so that they can return to power.
INGRAHAM: And Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, Alex, misses having an unfit president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: When those hospitals in rural America start closing down even more, you will understand when you don't have your social security, you will understand when your Medicaid and Medicare goes away, you will understand as planes continues to fall out of the sky, soon you will understand why it's important to maybe have somebody that isn't loud and ridiculous, and maybe Sleepy Joe is what we wanted because we could at least sleep at night.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK. So, Alex, now they're relegated to saying you should miss Sleepy Joe because you could sleep better. That's it. That's the argument.
ALEX MARLOW, BREITBART EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Yeah, it's not great messaging. And it's such a lie Medicare, Medicaid is going to go away and that's tolerated, I guess, on the left. It's amazing, Laura, because I've never donated to a politician before, but I might donate to Jasmine Crockett. I feel like she's here just for me and you and for people who, like Mollie, you have to create content every day for conservative audiences. I mean, she's a gift.
The American people rejected the woke moment entirely, and somehow only one new star has emerged for the Democrat Party since that election and it's Jasmine Crockett. We couldn't honestly plant someone any better to prove how inane the woke mob has gotten?
INGRAHAM: Well, we also know, Mollie, that the Democrats keep clinging to their old narratives. Bernie Sanders says he's fighting the oligarchy. It's a tour, apparently, that he's kicking off tomorrow in Omaha, because nothing screams the future like Bernie Sanders, Molly. Are you rushing to get your tickets?
HEMINGWAY: You know, Bernie Sanders actually would have had a better argument for the Democrat Party until they ousted him unfairly when he was running. But in the meantime, Republicans kind of took away all the issues that were working for the Democrats, including economic populism, and all that Democrats have right now is identity politics. And they have that at a time when most of America has said, we're kind of done with that. We don't want to do that anymore.
So, they need to get serious. They need to think about issues. But it's going to be hard for Bernie because while the Democrats were playing their games, Donald Trump kind of came in and presented a really great working- class agenda that got him a lot of votes from working class voters.
INGRAHAM: Yeah. I mean, all those issues, one after the other, Trump picked off and left the old Republican Party behind. And, Alex, at this point, you got all Trump nominees confirmed. Kash Patel was like that -- that was the spear in the side of liberalism today. How significant, very quickly, was that?
MARLOW: Yeah, Kash is the right guy because they went after him, they targeted with the lawfare, they messed with the wrong person. And now he's going to come in, he's going to absolutely clean house. He is exactly the deep state fears, and it's why he's so beloved by people on the right.
INGRAHAM: And Mitch McConnell even supported Kash Patel. Mollie, did you think that was going to happen?
HEMINGWAY: I was a little bit surprised, but he is a great pick and the guy who uncovered the Russia collusion hoax at the FBI. So, you could not have a better person there to clean out the problems there.
INGRAHAM: It's very exciting. Mollie and Alex, thanks so much. That's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media. A lot of Zoe reaction last night. Thanks for watching. It's America now and forever. Jesse Watters, he takes it from here.
