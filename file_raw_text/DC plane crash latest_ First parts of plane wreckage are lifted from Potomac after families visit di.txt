Preliminary flight data from the deadly mid-air collision between an American Airlines jet and a U.S. military Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, DC has shown a significant discrepancy in altitude readings between the aircraft upon collision.
Data from the flight recorder inside American Eagle flight 5342 suggested it was cruising at about 325ft, with a 25ft margin of error on either side, when the aircraft collided over the Potomac River, adjacent to Reagan National Airport at 8:53 p.m. last Wednesday, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
However, data gathered from the air traffic control tower read that the military helicopter was flying at an altitude of about 200ft upon colliding with the commercial plane. The approximate 100ft discrepancy has not yet been explained.

When asked why he was now blaming efforts to recruit people with disabilities during a White House press conference, Trump replied: "Because I have common sense, okay, and unfortunately, a lot of people don't," he said.
Vance said it's important officials "investigate everything" but doubled down on his claims that "DEI policies" may have impacted air traffic control.
"Let's just say the person at the controls didn't have enough staffing around him or her because we were turning people away because of DEI reasons," Vance said.

Crews in Washington, D.C. are continuing a somber recovery effort for the bodies of those aboard the American Airlines flight.
Twelve bodies remained among the wreckage as of Sunday afternoon, when it was confirmed that 55 had been recovered and identified, including all three of those on the US Army Black Hawk helicopter. 
The search effort, which began on Wednesday evening under cover of darkness, has been long and gruelling. 
Frigid water temperatures and difficult conditions have persisted as crews from nearly every dive team in the area attempt to recover the remaining bodies. 
"Things have kind of slowed down this weekend because they're waiting on a lot more heavier salvage equipment," David Hoagland, president of the Washington, DC, Firefighters Local 36, told CNN on Saturday. 
"They're going to be setting up for a pretty complicated operation where they're going to be removing plane parts from the water on Monday."

Hydraulic rescue tools which can cut through metal have been used to recover as many victims as possible, Hoagland added. 
Fire chief John Donnelly said authorities think they know where the remaining bodies are, but "we won't know until we're done."
"I believe that when we remove the aircraft, that will help us resolve this number," he added. "If it doesn't, we will continue the search."
A news release from the Army Corps of Engineers anticipated they would finish removing wreckage from the plane and helicopter by February 12.
