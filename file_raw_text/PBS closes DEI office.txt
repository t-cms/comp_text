Public broadcaster PBS is closing its office of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), The Hill confirmed Tuesday.
“In order to best ensure we are in compliance with the President’s executive order around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion we have closed our DEI office,” the outlet said in a statement. “The staff members who served in that office are leaving PBS. “
President Trump has  to strip DEI programs and initiatives from government departments and applied pressure on private companies to do the same.
“We will continue to adhere to our mission and values,” the outlet added. “PBS will continue to reflect all of America and remain a welcoming place for everyone.”
Major companies like , , , ,  and  have all rolled back DEI programs in recent months. 
PBS’s move also comes as Trump’s FCC continues to  on public broadcasters over taxpayer funding and editorial direction.
