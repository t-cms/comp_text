LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": The dog dead and the dog is alive, and we're going to get -- we'll get -- we'll get the actual story in the coming days, which we are anxious to get.
Dr. Baden, as always, thank you.
That's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media. A lot of new material put up on Instagram, and remember, it's America now and forever.
Jesse is next.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): The prices at the grocery store are going up because democracy is being taken away.
WATTERS: Democrats, dictatorship and DOGE.
JEFF JARVIS, JOURNALIST AND ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR: We are in the middle of a totalitarian fascist coup in this country.
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The job is already a cooker pressure -- it's already incredibly difficult. Some people have said it's the hardest job in the White House, it is a hard job. It was really hard.
WATTERS: The Binder is back without her binder.
JEAN-PIERRE: Sometimes I would lay in bed and be like, "Oh my God, what is going to happen today?"
REPORTER: We have some questions for you. Are you going to change the county's policy that allows biological men in females' locker rooms and bathrooms?
WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday.
KATHY SZELIGA (R), MARYLAND DELEGATE: Condoms for kiddies. This goes too far.
WATTERS: Plus --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jesse, let me tell you something --
WATTERS: It's official, foreign aid has been DOGEd after John Roberts of the Supreme Court ruled that Trump has the right to freeze the money. USAID staff cleared out their desks today, and Musk says we've just saved 60 billion bucks.
DOGE found a $75 million contract for inclusive justice in Colombia. $40 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment. Another $40 million for female empowerment in Colombia, pretty sure this money is for cocaine.
But don't worry, we're also going to give the Caribbean $3 million for being gay and lesbian. You're gay, and we want you to stay that way, and we still had money left over for terrorists.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Mr. Roman, are you aware that we are sending $40 million a week to the Taliban?
GREGG ROMAN, MIDDLE EAST FORUM: Yes, sir.
BURCHETT: Can you name other instances of foreign aid going to terrorist organizations?
ROMAN: We have assisted al-Shabaab in Somalia. There has been instances of the Hamza network in Sudan; Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, Kata'ib Hizballah, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham in Syria, dozens of terror organizations have received indirect assistance from U.S. foreign aid.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Are we funding terrorists so we have something to do with our missiles? The media doesn't want anything cut unless it's a circumcision.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHEN COLBERT, "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT" HOST: Trump talked about all the stuff DOGE is cutting and all the stuff they're not cutting and it got weird.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: $20 million here, $30 million here for, you know, a little educational course on something, circumcision, right? Circumcision.
COLBERT: That long, rambling response, actually reminds me of circumcision, because somebody really should have cut that (bleep) head off.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: DOGE has their brain so scrambled. Now, "The View" is begging for deportations.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": The guy was not born in this country, who was born under apartheid in South Africa. So has that mentality going on. He was pro-apartheid, as I understand it.
Now I'm getting some flack because I said that Musk was pro-apartheid. I don't really know, or for sure if he was. He grew up at that time when apartheid was full blown before the great Nelson Mandela fixed that. He was around at that time.
But maybe he was, maybe he wasn't. He might have been a young guy, too.
WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Might have been.
BEHAR: So don't be suing me, okay, Elon. They're allowed to say any lie they want, but we have to be. It is really strict. That's why this show is important.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Did Joy Behar just say go back to Africa? I don't think you can say that, can you? And I guess, we finally found out where Democrats stand on illegal immigration, deport Musk and keep MS-13.
They let millions of illegal Chinese, Muslims, and Venezuelans into America, but Musk who has been a citizen for 22 years, he's got to go.
So what if he's going to colonize Mars and build their electric cars? Go back to Africa. All of a sudden, saving taxpayers money is treason.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRITZKER: The prices at the grocery store are going up because democracy is being taken away.
JARVIS: We are in the middle of a totalitarian fascist coup in this country.
TOURE, SUBSTACK AUTHOR, "CULTURE FRIES BY TOURE": If we are being honest, there should be a breaking news banner on CNN, MSNBC, all day long. We are in dictatorship right now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Well, Democrats must be insane to think the dictator hoax is going to work after losing every swing state with it, and now they think Big Balls is going to peek into their tax returns.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: If we had a President AOC, a liberal, Democrat President who brought in a bunch of her friends, and they brought their laptops, and they started taking all the data and doing whatever they wanted to, the Republic would be in the streets as well they should.
This is no way to run a government. This is a dangerous precedent that's being set.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Well, they did that. Where was Van Jones when Trump's tax returns got leaked? That little liberal, leaky Littlejohn, remember, stole 400,000 of Americans' tax returns, 400,000, leaked them to the press, and Maddow waved it in the air like it was a righteous act, and leaky Littlejohn was just a contractor, Elon is a presidential appointee who hasn't stolen or leaked a thing.
Democrats are worried about security because they're the ones who can't be trusted with it. Hillary had a home server in her basement with secrets in it, and when she got caught, acid washed it.
Elon is not just about cutting the fat. Listen: Hundreds of federal workers are being promoted daily every time we encounter excellence.
Democrats are squealing Trump is going to cut Medicaid, but look what we found here. California was caught using Medicaid to pay for art and music lessons. Oregon was caught using Medicaid for cooking classes, air conditioners, and mini fridges. DOGE is saving us all money, and Democrats are fundraising to stop it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): I just left a massive citizen meeting that I organized on about 24 hours, 48 hours' notice, hundreds of people standing up with one voice to say, we are not going to allow for the billionaires to take over our government, and I need your help right now to stand up and help me build the kind of political operation all across the country that we need to fight back against this hateful, destructive agenda from Donald Trump and Elon Musk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now things are starting to get dangerous.
Police just arrested a trans man named Lucy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KDVR REPORTER: On February 7, police reported there was an arson attempt, plus acts of vandalism, including graffiti on some of the vehicles deemed offensive and hateful in nature.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: February 24th, Monday evening, we were working surveillance where we then encountered the defendant.
KDVR REPORTER: The suspect identified as 40-year-old Lucy Grace Nelson was stopped before committing what would have been considered a class three felony.
Nelson was arrested on multiple charges, including felony mischief, but the most concerning one to police was the use of explosives or incendiary devices.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The devices that were discovered had potential for serious damage.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The left spends all day calling Elon a fascist who should go back to Africa and all of a sudden, Trantifa is planning explosives at Tesla dealerships.
The threat level is so high that Musk has US Marshals augmenting his private security. I guess Democrats only like billionaires who add to the debt.
Elon is going to push hard no matter what it is. He's a pioneer. His brain is wired to break things and create things and not be like everybody else.
So when Trump and Elon see a wall, they don't stop. They go right through it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELON MUSK, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: Isn't mind blowing that this has happened? I mean, it just -- and what -- by the way, why do we still know nothing about that guy in Butler? What's going on?
But Kash is going to get to the bottom of it.
Yes. Wooh.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: If Democrats are worried what we're finding in government, the graft and their kickbacks, wait until we start sniffing around Butler. Wait until DOGE, Kash and Bondi pull the files on Butler, PA. The FBI closed that investigation real quick. No toxicology, body cremated, electronics blackholed and the Crooks family hires an expensive attorney with what money?
Pinch yourself. Go ahead. Do it.
We're living through history. No one has been able to cut waste in Washington -- Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, Obama, they all tried, couldn't do it. Until now.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We are having great success in slimming down our government. It's been really very successful. And some took payouts and buyouts, and others took other things, and some people we are finding out don't even exist. We're finding that we have a lot of people that don't exist, that people thought that did.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: We're even digitizing the retirement cave.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK EZELL, ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT: The administration came to us with a challenge, something that we've never done before. Process a retiree end-to-end digitally without printing anything to paper.
The deadline: In a week.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For the first time I went to the mine, the picture I had in my mind was something from the "X-Files."
Some retirees have a lot of paper, a lot more than others, and that there were a couple we encountered that actually had pallets of communication.
MARGARET PEARSON, U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT: We were asked, how long would it take to do this completely digitally? We gasped and said, seven months, maybe 12 months.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We got it done in record time within two days without printing one piece of paper.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Things are changing fast, and there's a lot of emotion around that. No one says this was going to be easy. Voters said when they put Trump back in the White House, they wanted him to come in and deliver "complete overhaul." This is going to make a lot of people very uncomfortable.
Trump has been shot. Elon, the second most targeted man in the world. The Democrats are desperate, and their bases are telling them to go harder.
Ironically, the voice of reason in a moment like this is Pretty Boy Floyd.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FLOYD MAYWEATHER, PROFESSIONAL BOXER: We had Trump before, we didn't appreciate him, but I think Trump is a great President. One of the -- actually, he is the best President in my eyes, he's the best President we ever had.
Great business -- a great businessman. Trump has done an amazing job, and a lot of people around America are upset. But no matter who goes in the White House, we're always upset.
CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right, right, right.
MAYWEATHER: And I think Trump is the man for the job.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACDONALD: Ohio's future governor, Vivek Ramaswamy, joins me now.
All right, Vivek, I'm going to have to call you Governor soon. I'm just getting it out of the way.
The hostility towards Elon Musk, where does this come from?
VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), OHIO GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: It comes from a place of irrationality.
For the last several years, people have had Trump derangement syndrome. That derangement syndrome has now expanded to include Elon and others.
The fact of the matter is, rationally speaking, though, Jesse, we have a $36 trillion national debt problem. We have to cut trillions of dollars in spending to rationalize.
Our budget wasn't that much bigger in 2019, it was four-and-a-half trillion dollars. This isn't an unthinkable amount. We are at $7 trillion today.
Another basic principle, the people we elect to run the government should be the ones who actually make the laws, not unelected bureaucrats. That's not controversial. The country was founded on that very premise.
And I do think that one of the areas that we're going to be able to be helpful here, Jesse, is a lot of those programs, from education to health care, they shouldn't be in Washington, D.C. They need to be devolved to the states and to the people where they belong.
So President Trump is leading us to a golden era for America, but that new golden age in our country will also be a golden age for federalism. Just kick it down to the states. That's what our founders envisioned.
Get it out of Washington, D.C. and I think that's going to be good, I think not just for Republicans, but for Democrats across the country as well, who deserve transparency into how their taxpayer dollars are being spent, and who deserve to have lower taxes as a consequence of that waste, fraud and abuse no longer existing in the system.
So that's what I think, and I think that's exactly where we're headed.
WATTERS: What would you do differently than Elon Musk and Big Balls?
RAMASWAMY: Well, it was a great start right out the gate, but what I want to see happen is that these changes, I want to see them become lasting changes, codified through legislation, codified in ways that, as much as you and I would not want a future Democrat President of the United States, it's always a possibility, right?
We've got to make sure that these are permanent changes and I'm confident the steps taken out of the gate, you've got to go fast. You've got to go quickly when Donald Trump was given the mandate that he's been given.
The mandate the voters gave Donald Trump was not for incremental change around the edges. The mandate last November was a mandate for sweeping, positive change in the country.
And I'm proud of President Trump. He's doing it in a way that I believe is actually uniting this country. You see it in some of the clips that you just played, a lot of non-traditional voting groups, from Black voters to young voters to Hispanic voters. This was a coalition that was broad and a coalition that demanded positive change in our country. That's what he's delivering.
Some will say he's moving too fast. I don't think the problem is that he's moving too fast. The problem is we had four years of open borders, over spending, victimhood culture, woke indoctrination, racial preferences. Against that backdrop, ballooning national debt, foreign wars popping up left and right, the largest infiltration of illegal immigrants into this country in American history, if you don't move fast against those four years, that's exactly what Donald Trump's doing, and it's how we're going to win our country back.
WATTERS: Well said, Vivek. Great having you on and good luck in Ohio. We really appreciate it.
RAMASWAMY: Thank you, my man. Thank you.
WATTERS: Well, the Binder is back and she's blowing the whistle.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Trump made a new friend today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: It's good to know that the United Kingdom has a true friend in the Oval Office.
We look forward to welcome you in the United Kingdom. Thank you once again.
TRUMP: Thank you very much. What a beautiful accent.
I would have been President 20 years ago if I had that accent.
Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Then they got down to business.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: Mr. President, did our Prime Minister persuade you not to put tariffs on the U.K.?
TRUMP: He tried. He was working hard, I will tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there. I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump is doing everything Biden couldn't and Biden seems okay with that. The Golden Age looks good on Joe. He was spotted at his favorite place, a train station, with the biggest smile we've seen since Inauguration.
Trump put the entire '24 Democrat Dream Team out of a job. Tim Walz is trying out a new career, stand-up comedy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): I know what -- I know what you're thinking. More handsome in person.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: But deep down, Tampon Tim can't get over the election. He still blames himself for the landslide. It's not all your fault, Tim, your whole party blew it, and they're still trying to pick up the pieces.
Doocy, our very own gave Binder PTSD.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEAN-PIERRE: The job is already a cooker pressure. It's already incredibly difficult. And to be the first, add that on top of what a difficult job, some people have said it's the hardest job in the White House. It's a hard job. Whatever -- people would say that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you say that?
JEAN-PIERRE: I would like -- yes, it is. Thank you. Thank you. It is.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: After Binder saw Trump swear in, she threw her T.V. out the window.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEAN-PIERRE: The last time I've watched the news was January 20th, when I was at the White House. I have not watched the news. I have really tried to focus on self-care.
I have deprogrammed myself so that I could be a civilian again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: You can't deprogram us. We remember Biden wandering around lost, speaking gibberish, shaking hands with ghosts and the Binder, calling it all a cheap fake. Remember?
Trump doesn't stop talking to the press. Biden hid in a bunker. Can Binder explain that?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEAN-PIERRE: The President spoke to it himself. He was very honest. He was like, look, I don't speak as well as I used to. I don't move as well as I used to.
He was very honest about what the American people were seeing. So he never hid from that.
As far as it comes to interviews, look, this was a different media landscape. It really was. He wanted to talk about issues, and it was very hard to have interviews where we were able to talk about issues.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: A different media landscape? Every reporter wanted to interview the President. Biden said no. Then he botched the debate and got couped.
Binder still is hurt over it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEAN-PIERRE: There was a disconnect for me what was happening with leadership in the Democratic Party. It was a firing squad, and I had never seen anything like it before. I had never seen a party do that in the way that they did, and it was hurtful and sad to see that happening, a firing squad around a person who I believe was a true patriot. That was shocking. Shocking.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The hardest part of a coup is finding a good leader to replace the guy you backstabbed, Kamala, not the answer.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I talked to a lot of Democrats, of people since I've been here at Harvard, say, who the hell do I look to?
JEAN-PIERRE: I actually don't have anybody that I'm going to call out or put out there. I'm not.
But I think that it is important for, it doesn't matter if you're a Governor, Congress, Senator, a local elected official --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Former Vice President.
JEAN-PIERRE: Former -- former Vice President. I want to see many voices. I don't just want to see one. I want to see many who can lead us -- lead us through this time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Here's the problem with the Democrat voices, nobody wants to hear them. While they figure themselves out, Roseanne has some advice. Let's listen.
"We are at the point where anyone identifying as a Democrat at this point should just be pointed at and laughed at. That's it. No more arguing, just point and laugh."
Tomi Lahren is an OutKick.com host and host of "100 Days" with Tomi Lahren. How are you doing, Tomi?
TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: It's great to see proof of life from former President Joe Biden.
WATTERS: Yes.
LAHREN: That was nice to see, and I think that both him and Binder are indulging in some self-care and it looks good on them. But what really strikes me is how much they both really just hate Kamala Harris.
WATTERS: Yes.
LAHREN: You heard her right there when she was asked. They really tried to lead her into saying, yes, Kamala Harris is the likely heir in 2028.
WATTERS: Didn't do it.
LAHREN: She wants to hear many voices. So I think Joe is so happy that the Democratic Party is in shambles. Listen, they threw him under the bus. Now, he is riding on trains taking selfies. He does not care.
And she, I think she is upset about it too. Kamala is not the girl. And I think she's just enjoying, you know, her Bravo, her Real Housewives for self-care. And she's so happy she doesn't have the hardest job in the world anymore.
WATTERS: It was a real cooker pressure, Tomi. It was a cooker pressure. God, I missed Binder. I really did. There's something sweet and endearing about her that I missed.
Do you believe that she hasn't followed the news since she left?
LAHREN: I think she probably does have some stress over the whole ordeal, and I do believe she's probably not watching the news. I think she's relieved. Listen, I think this is probably the last we're going to see of her. I don't think that there's any federal job openings right now either. I don't think that that's the way that she's going to go.
But here's the thing about the Democratic Party. We've got Tim Walz who is trying to be a comedian.
WATTERS: Right.
LAHREN: Okay. We've got Kamala and Joe who signed with CAA, a talent agency. We've got Gavin Newsom launching yet another podcast. I'm waiting for them to link the Amazon storefront or bring the skincare routine. I don't think they even want to be a party anymore.
WATTERS: I can see Gavin out there with a little moisturizer right here. You know, actually, I'd buy anything from him. He looks like he knows what he's doing.
LAHREN: He's got good hair, like you.
WATTERS: Oh, stop it.
LAHREN: But he's got the new podcast. I don't think they want to be a party anymore, Jesse, I think they want to be influencers, and maybe that's a better route.
WATTERS: She wants to come on your podcast, Gavin.
LAHREN: I do desperately.
WATTERS: Tomi and Gavin, let's see it. Thank you so much.
LAHREN: Good to see you.
WATTERS: Something very strange happened with the Epstein files today.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Last night on JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME, Attorney General Pam Bondi said this --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PAM BONDI, US ATTORNEY GENERAL: What you're going to see, hopefully tomorrow is a lot of flight logs, a lot of names, a lot of information, but it's pretty sick what that man did.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So we were looking today to find out more about why the government has been so suspiciously protective of Jeffrey Epstein.
This afternoon, a bunch of conservative influencers left a meeting at the White House with binders that said "The Epstein Files Phase One."
Once the binders were opened, people were able to see flight records and Epstein's Rolodex and a list of masseuses. The masseuses names were blacked out, and the information from the flight logs wasn't new, neither was the Rolodex.
When we began to feel duped, Pam Bondi released a letter that says, basically, I was duped, too. In a letter addressed to FBI Director Kash Patel, Bondi, basically says I asked you for the full and complete files related to Jeffrey Epstein. I received 200 pages of documents. I asked if these were all the documents, and the FBI said yes.
Late yesterday, I learned from a source at the FBI field office in New York was in possession of thousands of pages of documents related to the investigation and the indictment of Epstein.
Despite my repeated requests, the FBI never disclosed the evidence of these files.
Bond is demanding by 8:00 AM tomorrow morning that the FBI deliver everything to her office, including all records, audio, video recordings, all materials related to Epstein, and she ensures DOJ will disclose everything, and she's directing Patel to begin an immediate investigation into why the FBI isn't following orders.
So who's in charge at the New York FBI field office? Who is withholding Epstein docs from the Attorney General?
James Dennehy is running the show there. There he is. This is the guy who e-mailed his whole staff to dig in after Trump took office. And don't forget that James Comey's daughter is an Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. She worked on the Epstein and Maxwell cases. She's kind of knee deep in this.
Epstein was facing sex trafficking charges in Lower Manhattan. Where is all of that paperwork? The FBI seized computers, surveillance videos, banking records, file cabinets and photographs from all of Epstein's properties in New Mexico, the Virgin Islands, Palm Beach, and in New York. The Justice Department also gave Epstein a sweetheart non-prosecution deal 17 years ago. Where are those files?
The Bureau of Prisons? Where are those files? You remember where Epstein killed himself? I asked Bill Barr about that, why everything seemed to go wrong that night.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAM BARR, FORMER US ATTORNEY GENERAL: When I first heard all the information and all the coincidences here, I was suspicious.
WATTERS: What were the coincidences? I mean, those were a lot of coincidences.
BARR: Well, one of the cameras was out.
WATTERS: Right.
BARR: He was supposed to have a cellmate. The cellmate left. They didn't replace the cellmate, and the guards who were supposed to check him every half hour didn't check.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: My EMT source said he was on the scene immediately to pull Epstein's body out to the morgue, and when he got to the cell, he saw seven people there touching Epstein's body, moving stuff around.
Trump did say during the campaign, he'd released these files, so it's not like this came out of the blue. Jeffery Epstein did act as an informant to the FBI. Is the Bureau embarrassed? Is the Bureau embarrassed that they let hundreds of young victims down?
This was all happening right under everyone's noses. Epstein was probably an intelligence asset rumored to be working with the Israelis, maybe this country, probably other countries. Was he a double agent? He had dirt on everyone and a knack for making cash, and he's dead. So the government has no one to protect but themselves.
Epstein victim attorney, Jennifer Freeman and former CIA officer and whistleblower, John Kiriakou.
All right, John, what explains this weird turf war today?
JOHN KIRIAKOU, FORMER CIA AGENT AND SENIOR INVESTIGATOR INTO THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: I think the easiest explanation is that so many FBI agents have been there for years, for decades. They think it's their organization. It's not Kash Patel's organization or even Pam Bondi's and they're going to do as they please.
Times have changed, and they have until eight o'clock tomorrow morning to get with the program or walk out the door.
WATTERS: And what happens if by 8:00 AM those files aren't on Miss Bondi's desk?
KIRIAKOU: I would start firing people. You know, at the CIA, we always worked at the pleasure of the President. If the President didn't like the cut of your suit, you were shown the door and there's something to that. I think that that's the way it should be.
If you refuse to obey a direct lawful order to turn documents over, then you need to go and somebody else should have that job, who can do it.
WATTERS: All right, Miss Freeman, this must be just a sad day for your client, for all of these victims, it's just more mystery, more obstruction. How are you processing it? How is your client processing it?
JENNIFER FREEMAN, ATTORNEY: Well, we've been looking through the documents, which we just got, like, an hour plus ago, and it's a bit of a ho-hum. You know, certainly there are some information there. There are four categories of information, there's logs, there's evidence, there's contact lists, and then there's a blank list of masseuses.
And there's some interesting things on there. Alan Dershowitz appears multiple times. Bill Clinton appears with four Secret Service. We see a reference to nude and semi-nude images and videos, what we call CSAM, which is child pornography.
And there are some interesting contact lists, more Secret Services, and some Hollywood A-listers. But one of the things that really struck me, because this is one of the issues that we've been pushing, is that what we saw evidence of was CSAM, this child pornography.
This is the issue that the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office completely missed, and this is something that's so critical and could have put him away for life, many, many, many years ago.
So yes, my client, Maria Farmer and many other clients are very upset that they've been treated with the back of the hand over and over. I called for an investigation of this matter a year-and-a-half ago, and I got a big fat nothing, and I got a letter that says, well, the issues and the allegations are concerning, but we're really kind of busy, and we'll get back to you. And of course, they did not.
WATTERS: All right, well, we're going to go through the release tonight and have more tomorrow. Miss Freeman, John, thanks for joining us. Just a weird day. We appreciate it.
Fox News Alert: Actor, Gene Hackman and his wife were found dead today, and it was a very suspicious scene.
Senior national correspondent Kevin Corke has more -- Kevin.
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Jesse.
The search is on tonight for answers as investigators try to piece together what exactly happened to the 95-year-old film star and his 64-year-old wife as well as one of their pets, all of whom were found deceased in their home in New Mexico.
The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department said the deaths were "suspicious enough in nature to warrant a deeper look."
We are told there were no signs of obvious blunt force trauma or carbon monoxide poisoning or forced entry into the home. We're also told they were discovered by a pair of maintenance workers according to a search affidavit.
Now the front door of the two-story home was also apparently ajar by the time deputies arrived.
Hackman's and Arakawa's bodies were found in separate rooms in the house, and we learned tonight that there were apparently pills strewn about on the floor near Arakawa's body, but investigators have not suggested that that was a cause of death.
The Oscar-winning actor, whose career spanned more than 40 years and included nearly 80 films among some of the all-time great films: "Hoosiers," "Bonnie & Clyde," "The French Connection," and "Unforgiven."
Gene Hackman, the search for answers into his untimely death was 95 years old, and Jesse, the investigation is ongoing.
Back to you.
WATTERS: All right, thank you so much. We appreciate it.
CORKE: You bet.
WATTERS: On a different note, happy DEI Thursday.

AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We will be doing this on a weekly basis. DEI is something we must have.
WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday. It's our favorite day of the week. It's in honor of Al Sharpton. We're going to bring you the best stories about diversity, equity and inclusion.
First up in Maryland, Democrats want to change up the vending machines in preschools, and we're not talking about chips and soda --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SZELIGA: Condoms for kiddies. This goes too far.
Imagine walking into preschool with your three, four, five-year-old. You walk by the machine and they say, "Mommy, Daddy, what's in that machine?"
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats want condom-vending machines in school. Republicans said, okay, maybe high school, but not preschool. And Democrats said, no, all kids, even preschoolers must practice safe sex.
And we thought condoms for Gaza was bad.
Next up, we're about two months away for Mother's Day, and if you live in Wisconsin, heads up, you might have to buy a new card.
Democrat Governor Tony Evers snuck a minor tweak into his budget proposal on Page 1,766 the term "mother" has been swapped for "inseminated person," and the Governor says, "deal with it."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. TONY EVERS (D-WI): What the Republicans say is a lie. So of course, I'm pretty PO'ed about that. All this does, it gives people a chance that are using IVF, which I think, I think Republicans are kind of okay with that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Okay. And who uses IVF to get pregnant, Tony? Mothers. See I said it, it's not that hard.
And lastly, meet Richard Cox, a tier three sex offender who was arrested in Fairfax County, Virginia. Cops says he exposed himself to women and kids in locker rooms and bathrooms across the county. Well, how did he get into the ladies room? It's simple, Dick Cox says he was a lady, and according to the county's rules, if you say you're a woman, you can use whatever bathroom you want.
A local news reporter cornered the Fairfax County Chair on the policy, and guess what happened?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: Chairman, we have some questions for you. Are you going to change the county's policy that allows biological men and females locker rooms and bathrooms?
Sir, do you have an answer to that? And are you aware a sex offender used that policy to gain access to rec center locker rooms? Are you aware that that happened?
Those were just some of the many questions I had for Jeff McKay today that I asked and we walked around the Fairfax County Government Center asking Jeff McKay these questions for three minutes, and he avoided all of our questions. He ended up going into the men's bathroom to avoid my questions.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Hiding in the bathroom to avoid questions about bathroom policy. I hope he didn't lock himself in.
And no DEI Thursday is complete without a victory. Major Companies are dropping DEI like a bad habit.
Today, Paramount declared DEI dead. The entertainment giant said, we will no longer set or use aspirational numerical goals related to the race, ethnicity, sex or gender of hires.
Bank of America is joining them, scrapping diversity quotas, and so is BlackRock, even though just three years ago, their CEO, Larry Fink, declared the company must "must embed DEI into everything we do."
So since Elon asked all federal workers for their five accomplishments at work, we thought it's only fair to send Johnny to ask what yours are. Watch.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Remember that friend of yours that had the fuzz buster, put it on like the little dashboard. All of a sudden you're driving around, spin, you knew when the cops were close, and if you got pulled over and you got caught with the fuzz buster, you're like scrambling trying to put it away in the glove compartment.
Man, those were the days I miss them.
