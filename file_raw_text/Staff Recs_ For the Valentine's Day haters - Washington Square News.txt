Staff Recs: For the Valentine's Day haters
Sometimes you need a change of pace from everyone chucking pink and red at you.

Happy Valentine's Day from the Arts Desk! If you're a cynic like most of us, Valentine's Day is just another Friday in February. Therefore, here are some anti-lovey media recommendations to watch with your friends and chuck popcorn at the TV. Here's to rejecting the Hallmark-industrial complex. 
"Someone Great" (2019)
The audience is introduced to music journalist Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) after she gets dumped by her long-term boyfriend, Nate (LaKeith Stanfield), for moving to San Francisco after getting her dream job at Rolling Stone. Armed with best friends Erin (DeWanda Wise) and Blair (Brittany Snow), she attempts to pull herself out of the breakup depression while saying goodbye to New York. Jenny's the most healthy yet unhealthy depiction of a breakup. Her and Nate, despite loving each other, aren't meant to be together. Your heart breaks along with her because it's a tried and true tale of career versus love. 
The combination of captivating neon lights with Lorde cult classics creates what's not only a gut-wrenching movie, but one that's beautiful to experience. It's important to have a go-to heartbreak movie that doesn't end with you wanting to call your ex - and this is it. If Jenny doesn't call Nate, you too can resist the urge, because there's no way your relationship was better than theirs.

"Date Yourself Instead"
"Date Yourself Instead" is currently my favorite podcast. I think it's because I have actually been "dating myself" recently by embracing being single, taking myself out on dates and focusing on myself and my friends above all. Hosted by Lyss Boss, the podcast focuses on self-love, self-respect and how to protect your peace, among many other things along the self-help vein. I have been listening to it for a few months now, and I can confidently say a lot of Boss' advice has helped me improve my relationship with myself and introduce some really impactful and empowering habits into my life.

"La La Land"(2016)
I genuinely think I'm the biggest "La La Land" fan in the world. I swear I'm not a masochist, but I've seen it 20 times, the most recent of which was in concert at Carnegie Hall. It's easy to become enthralled with actress Mia (Emma Stone) and jazz musician Sebastian's (Ryan Gosling) palpable chemistry and their sheer love for their crafts, which only makes the film's epilogue worse. The first time I watched "La La Land," I couldn't understand why the couple didn't find their way back to one another. Now that I've lived a little more, I've grown to appreciate it.
Sometimes, the most romantic thing in life is your passion, and "La La Land" reaffirms the fact that it's okay to prioritize your goals and push others to do the same. I can't help but cry when Sebastian and Mia say, "I'm always gonna love you" while sitting in Griffith Park before they part ways - they genuinely see and respect one another as artists, and they know what it means to be fools who dream. 
- Dani Biondi, Film & TV Editor
"Beef" (2023)
A dissatisfied contractor and worn-down art-world entrepreneur collide in a fender-bender outside of a department store and quickly get into a heated argument. While this bout of road rage might seem like the recipe for a groundbreaking meet-cute in today's entertainment economy, the resulting mutual obsession between Amy Lau (Ali Wong) and Danny Cho (Steven Yeun) is fueled by hatred, not love. They clash repeatedly over many years, both by chance and by choice, as their external lives - Amy's career and marriage, and Danny's already fragile financial status - begin to crumble because of their feud. Through a saga consisting of vandalism, stalking and threats, the pair's infatuation is driven by the enticing prospect of getting even. Their increasingly palpable and violent rivalry allows them to see not only the worst parts of one another, but also the most honest. The result is not only an addictive series but a candid portrayal of cultural divide, class, economic hardship and some of the less praiseworthy aspects of the human condition. It's been said that the opposite of love isn't hate, but indifference. If you're not feeling the love today, then this show will most definitely keep you far from bored.

"Tainted Love" by Soft Cell
Some people compare going through a breakup to experiencing the five stages of grief. In the beginning, you experience a deep denial and refuse to believe that your relationship is over, or bargain to get your love back. If "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell could be assigned to one of the five stages, it would be the final one: acceptance. 
This song tells the story of someone who only realizes how poorly they have been treated in their relationship once it is over. The lyrics exclaim, "Once I ran to you (I ran) / Now, I'll run from you." The electric sounds of the synths and upbeat tune match the liberating feeling of this realization. The song articulates the complexities of ending a relationship when you are still in love with the person you are leaving. This feeling is expressed through lyrics such as "I love you, though you hurt me so / Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go." Not only does this person need to get away from their past relationship, but they have to "run away" because they understand how alluring it can be to return to a toxic ex. "Tainted Love" is the perfect song to dance through your post-breakup emotions, reminding you of the self-worth and respect you deserve.
