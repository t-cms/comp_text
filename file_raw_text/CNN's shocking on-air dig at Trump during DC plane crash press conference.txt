                     CNN claimed President Donald Trump blamed DEI 'without evidence' during his press briefing on the deadly collision in Washington, DC.
Trump addressed the nation Thursday calling the collision a 'tragedy of terrible proportions' and confirmed there were no survivors in staggering remarks criticizing the hiring practices of federal agencies. 
During the press conference, CNN bannered their coverage with: 'With no evidence, Trump blames DEI for deadly midair collision.'
He also clashed with the network's Chief White House Correspondent, Kaitlan Collins, answering her question stating, 'It's not a smart question.' 
Trump said the he had some 'pretty good ideas' of how the disaster occurred and vowed to make sure it would never happen again.
Trump added he put 'safety' first while Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden prioritized politics and called former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a 'disaster' in an extraordinary attack on previous administrations.
Then he insisted that federal agencies need to be hiring based on intelligence rather than on diversity. He added that Air Traffic Controllers need to be 'geniuses'.
