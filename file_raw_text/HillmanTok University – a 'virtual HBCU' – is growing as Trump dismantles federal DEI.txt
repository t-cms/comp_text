'Act of intimidation' 
Hinton said the online model of a university is bringing joy and community to Black learners and teachers during "the rollbacks on DEI and the current political climate." 
"There are people who are thirsty for education and knowledge, and there are people who are very desiring to give it," Hinton said. "Everyone is in a place of trying to focus on what we can control instead of what we can't. And what we are able to do is have some autonomy over the ability to build with one another and to build each other up."

Hinton left her role as an elementary school teacher to focus on building HillmanTok University full-time in mid-February.
'We're restoring culture'
The mission of HillmanTok University is help to Black people connect and to create a necessary movement of Black culture and education, said Hinton and Leah Moffit, a team member at HillmanTok University. 
"We are literally creating a culture and connecting community," said Hinton. She said name comes from the fictional setting of "," a hit sitcom that aired from 1987 to 1993 and was set at a HBCU called Hillman College.

"There are some people that don't even realize that Hillman is a reference to one of the biggest groundbreaking shows in black sitcoms," Hinton said. "Some people don't even realize that black sitcoms were a big thing in all of TV history. We're restoring culture."
Moffit said its especially crucial to spread the message of joy and culture now during Black History Month. 
"It's about community appreciation, community uplifting and community connection," Moffitt said.
