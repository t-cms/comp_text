BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Special Report, the House Subcommittee overseeing DOGE holds its first congressional hearing. Remember if you can't catch us live, set your DVR, 06:00 p.m. in the East, 03:00 p.m. on the West Coast. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for this Special Report. Fair, balanced, and still unafraid. "The Ingraham Angle" is next.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. My Angle in moments, but first, if you think someone is stealing, let's say from your family, would you stand by and do nothing, especially when your family was already in financial trouble? Of course, you wouldn't stand by and do nothing. You'd take extraordinary measures to protect your family. Well, that's what President Trump did when he decided to tackle government waste and corruption by unleashing DOGE and Elon Musk, who gave a tutorial, by the way, in basic economics from the Oval Office today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELON MUSK, CEO, X: We've got a $2 trillion deficit. And if this -- if we don't do something about this deficit, country is going bankrupt. I mean, it's really astounding that the interest payments alone on national debt exceed the Defense Department budget, which is shocking, because we got a lot -- we spent a lot of money on defense. But -- and if that just keeps going, we're essentially going to bankrupt the country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: In other words, letting the bureaucracy continue to run wild and unaccountable. It's not an option.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: So what I really want to say is like it's not optional for us to sit to reduce the federal expenses. It's essential. It's essential for America to remain solvent as a country, and it's essential for America to have the resources necessary to provide things to its citizens and not simply be servicing vast amounts of debt.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: But those who profit off the decline of America, they don't care, because the totally organic protesters descending upon D.C. almost every day that are organized by deep pocket lobbyists and government unions, they're fighting to keep the federal kleptocracy going.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): Elon Musk needs to keep his grubby hands, his greedy, grubby hands off of our government.
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): I wish Article II gave us the power to impeach fake presidents too, because I'd be putting in articles tomorrow morning to impeach Elon Musk.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) Donald Trump and Elon Musk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: No wonder we're in such a mess. These are unserious people. They have zero solutions. They don't care what happens to America and oh, by the way, it's just typical gutter language.
But watching Elon Musk late this afternoon, it was obvious he's unfazed by all of that, that noise, and in fact, he kind of welcomes the scrutiny.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your detractors, Mr. Musk.
MUSK: I have to -- what?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Including a lot of Democrats.
MUSK: I have detractors.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You do, sir.
MUSK: I don't believe it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Say that you're orchestrating a hostile takeover of government and doing it in a non-transparent way. What's your response to that criticism?
MUSK: Well, first of all, you couldn't ask for a stronger mandate from the public. The public voted. We have a majority of the public voting for President. We won the House; we won the Senate. The people voted for major government reform. In this presidency, they are going to get what they voted for, and that's what democracy is all about.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Of course it is. He's absolutely right. Even Elon's adorable four year old son sitting on his shoulders and standing right next to him can probably grasp that concept, because President Trump knows his arrangement with Musk is unusual and it is, let's face it. Giving Elon Musk the floor to speak directly to the American people, it just came off as brilliant.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: I fully expect to be scrutinized and get a daily proctology exam basically. I'll be scrutinized non-stop and -- but with support of the President, we can, we can cut the budget deficit in half from what 2 trillion to 1, and then with deregulation, because there's a lot of sort of regulations that don't ultimately serve the public good. We need to free the builders of America to build and if we do that, and that means, if you can get a trillion dollars economic growth, and you cut the budget deficit by a trillion between now and next year, there is no inflation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And like a great teacher, he explains what that actually means to the average Joe out there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: That's a fantastic scenario for the average American. I mean, imagine they go down the grocery aisle and the prices from one year to the next are the same, and their mortgage, all the debt payments dropped. How great is that for the average American?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That's great indeed. But did this impromptu Musk tutorial, did it impress any of our favorite media mal contents?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump and first buddy, Elon Musk at the resolute desk in the Oval Office, defending their aggressive efforts to overhaul the government and root out fraud.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are certain contracts and certain spending at the federal government that Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk don't like. That is what has largely been canceled.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Irony died while he was talking. The only unelected party in any of this is Elon Musk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: All right, joining me now, Texas Congressman Brandon Gill. Congressman, great to see you. The Democrats have been acting like Elon Musk is Satan here, because he's actually doing, frankly, what journalists who care, and frankly what all of you on Capitol Hill, and you just got to Capitol Hill, I'm not blaming you, but should have been doing all along, which is watching how the money is spent. He's actually doing it, and now he's enemy, public enemy number one.
REP. BRANDON GILL (R-TX): Well, first of all, Laura, thanks for having me on. You know the hysterics are par for the course for the Democrats. You know, the Democrat party isn't upset that the federal government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars every single year on wasteful programs, in fraudulent programs. What they're upset about is that the waste is finally being exposed. They're like the little kid who's gotten their hands stuck in the cookie jar and they've been caught.
What we're finding over the past several weeks is that so much of the Left's institutional ecosystem is inorganic. It wouldn't exist, were it not for billions of taxpayer dollars every single year funding it. Think about Left-wing media, NPR, PBS. We're even paying tax dollars to Politico and the BBC. Think of the Left-wing NGOs that we're funding, that are facilitating the invasion of our country by illegal aliens, the millions of dollars that are funding transgender surgeries and transgender activism all over the globe. This is what the Leftist political movement has been based on, and we're finally calling it out. We're ending these programs, and the Left can't handle it.
INGRAHAM: Well, and of course, Democrats know that this is their power base. This is how they affect the culture. This is how they fund their friends, and that includes subscriptions to various media outlet, some of them might be legitimate, but the Democrats so far, at least, Congressman, they are refusing to engage on this topic or even work with Republicans much at all. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): There's very little appetite to help Republicans when we don't trust that Donald Trump is going to spend the resources that we've allocated. With Elon Musk and his unelected friends running through and combing through the federal system, we don't have those assurances.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Congressman, your reaction?
GILL: Well, I find it funny that the Democrats are obsessed with Elon Musk being unelected. The entire point of the DOGE process is to bring accountability back to the unelected administrative state. Laura, over the past several decades, Congress has abdicated power to a growing bureaucracy that is metastasizing, that is acting against the interests of the American people, against the will of the American people. We are reining that in, first by exposing the waste and the corruption, and then the next step is going to be defunding these agencies or abolishing --
INGRAHAM: But Congressman -- Congressman, let me jump in here, though, because Congress can actually do a lot more. And thank God we have someone who is volunteering his time when he's the richest person in the world and has a lot of other things he could be doing. But thank God we have him. But Congress actually could step in, could it not and amend the Administrative Procedure Act, which is at the heart of a lot of these legal challenges. We're going to get to some of that later on, but Congress can do a lot more to pull back the accountability and pull back authority from these agencies that frankly, they've delegated an enormous amount of authority to, over decades, when you -- before you are even born, this was going on. This is - - this is -- this has been happening for decades, Congressman.
GILL: That's exactly right. It has been happening for decades, and I think that we will be making moves to rein in this on a statutory basis. I'm part of the DOGE Subcommittee of the Oversight Committee, and we are getting started very fast. We have a hearing tomorrow where we're going to be going over fraud and Medicare and Medicaid, and that's only the first step. But you're exactly right. We have our work cut out for us.
And let me, let me remind you, Laura, that this is an incredibly popular movement from the Republicans. 70 percent of Americans believe that President Trump is doing what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail. His approval rating is at 53 percent higher than it was in his first -- in his first term.
INGRAHAM: Promises made.
GILL: Elon Musk in the DOGE movement is polling higher than President Biden did in his final week of Office. This is what the American people want.
INGRAHAM: And Congressman, are you the youngest Congressman currently serving in the U.S. government? Is that right?
GILL: I'm the youngest Republican.
INGRAHAM: Youngest Republican and a Dartmouth College graduate. Thank you very much. Brandon, thank you very much. Congressman, we appreciate it.
All right, first DOGE went after dozens of DEI offices and USAID, then CFPB, then the NIH, and now it's working its way through my old haunt, the Department of Education, and it slashing millions and again, wasteful spending. It's been going on for decades. It's only gotten worse, and now it looks like FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency might be next under the DOGE guillotine.
Now, Trump is writing on Truth Social that the Biden run FEMA has been a disaster. FEMA should be terminated. Individual states should handle storms, et cetera, as they come. Big savings and far more efficient. Getting rid of FEMA would be huge. The agency's 2025 budget, $65 billion that employs, however, more than 20,000 people nationwide. But remember, after Hurricane Helene, FEMA left Americans stranded.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We drove by people living in tents for months and months, and these people depended on FEMA to help them, and they were left high and dry.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And after Hurricane Milton, we saw how hugely bias the agency came across when an employee told relief workers skip the homes with the Trump flags. Isn't that nice?
Joining me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Governor, thank you so much for joining us. We've got some immigration news we're going to, but you want to replace FEMA, given all your experience with it over the years, the Florida hurricanes, with block grants. How would that disempower the bureaucracy?
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): So if you just eliminated the FEMA bureaucracy, and when these disaster happens, you said, we're going to block grant a certain amount of money to the states and let us administer it. You can give me $0.75 on the dollar, and that money will go further to help my people than running it through this cumbersome bureaucracy of FEMA. And as you pointed out, Laura on the dust of Hurricane Milton to say, don't go to Trump supporters homes when they needed it. That was really the last straw.
So yes, we could administer it better. We would be able to do it far cheaper than FEMA does, and our constituents would be able to get response. It's interesting, when these storms happen, we do the prep at the state and local level. We do the response, search and rescue, help with the power restoration, all the key things, and people are happy with that in Florida, it's then when they have to start dealing with FEMA and how that interacts with local government that people just want to pull their hair out. So I think the President is right. Eliminate the bureaucracy, block grant us the money. It will save taxpayer dollars, but it will actually benefit people in need more.
INGRAHAM: Now, sadly, FEMA is its own disaster zone, so now we have to rescue the disaster zone for the people's benefit. Governor, I don't know if you caught any of what amounted to a tutorial on government bloat and bureaucracy from the Oval Office short while ago with Elon Musk, but I've never -- I've been in Washington far too long, like 30 years, I have never seen someone hold court as he did in front of the -- I guess. I don't know how many media people there. He had his little son who was kind of squirming, as adorable as he was, he was, he didn't miss a beat. And the naysayers at the end of it could only say, Ooh, he's unaccountable, Governor. He has -- he doesn't have any vetting. There's no vetting of Elon Musk. What is your reaction to his role here and how it's playing out?
DESANTIS: Donald Trump ran on Elon Musk. This was something that he promised the voters, so he's just following through. The president is the only one in the executive branch elected, everyone else is a delegate that he picks to be able to do things. I'll tell you, you mentioned watching this for many years. We've seen the administrative state in this permanent bureaucracy spiral out of control. It seems like it gets worse all the time.
What Elon is doing is he is highlighting this in a way that's really resonating with the American people. So I think this DOGE has a lot of momentum. I think what they're doing has been very positive. I think the key is going to be, is Congress going to wake up from its slumber, start taking the power of the purse seriously and discipline these bureaucracies. We should not be run by unaccountable bureaucrats. The founders provided the tools to Congress. They just haven't been willing to use it. But I think what Elon has done has been a public service.
You know, it's like he's the most -- he's the richest guy in the world. It's not like he needs to be doing this. He's doing pretty good, but I think he really cares about constitutional government, and he's seen it spiral out of control, like the rest of us. So, you know, Florida, Laura, we are very lean. We were kind of DOGE before DOGE was cool. But if we could bring any of that to Washington, and Congress can actually enact some of the things that Elon is talking about and the President is talking about, that's going to be a huge win for the American people.
INGRAHAM: Yes, I mean Florida, you know, Tennessee, South Dakota, you guys are the future of the United States. You're Texas, obviously. The last time you were here speaking of fighting bureaucracy, there was a -- there was a kind of a fight brewing in your state about immigration enforcement, about mandating that local law enforcement actually cooperate with ICE. We saw big flights go to Venezuela today and reach Venezuelan, land with some of our old illegals here. But last night, I understand some -- some fairly significant deal was reached in Florida, not a moment too soon, very briefly, tell us about it.
DESANTIS: So we are going to have a duty on all state and local law enforcement to fully participate with immigration enforcement and ICE. We also are going to make illegally being in Florida a crime that can be prosecuted in and of itself, and we're also eliminating this catch and release for these criminal illegal aliens, as well as other things that are really significant. So, Florida will have the strongest set of proposals for interior enforcement.
And here's the thing, Laura, we want to see illegal aliens removed from our state and our country. ICE can't do it alone. They don't have enough resources. The state and locals have to assist. And if we're willing to assist, you're going to see those numbers go up.
INGRAHAM: It has to go up. Governor, before you go, you know, I'm going to ask you about this NBC report about your wife, Casey, considering a run for governor in 2026. I was in Florida over the weekend. I got -- was getting buzzed by calls about this. Governor, what can you tell us?
DESANTIS: Well, people have been asking her to do this for so long and run for office. She's a force of nature. I think people look at it, they say, well, the governor won by 20 points. Obviously, Casey would do better because she's so much better, but it's not something that she's seeking out. I think a lot of people are just concerned about the future of the state, but this is not anything new. People have been asking her to do this for a long time, but she's not seeking to do anything, but it's flattering that people are asking her to do it.
INGRAHAM: Have you talked to President Trump about this, or any conversation at all about what he might think about this or?
DESANTIS: No, I haven't. I mean, I know he thinks -- he respects the First Lady very much, and everybody does in Florida. I mean, she's done a remarkable job for the state. She's obviously a great wife and mother to three kids, and she has an inspirational story of overcoming cancer diagnosis, fighting through that and coming out stronger on the other end. And you know, she's one of the rare political spouses. Even though I'm probably the most conservative governor in the country, she may even be more conservative than me.
INGRAHAM: I think so. I know Casey. I think she actually might be, you know, you know she's just going to be better Governor than you, Governor. I mean, come on, like we know. I'm just -- you can't win -- you have to -- you have to compliment Casey and compliment -- it's the battle of the -- of the DeSantis's. It sounded like a campaign commercial there, Governor, your little spiel there. We appreciate it. Governor, thank you very much. All right, the free ride is over. My Angle explains next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Ending global welfare, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. All right, the globalists gathered in Paris, and they got a friendly but firm earful today. Vice President J.D. Vance had a message to world leaders about America's plans regarding the future of AI. The simple message, if you want our business, you're going to have to treat us, right? We'll work with you, but don't think of taking advantage of us or bullying American corporations.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
J.D. VANCE (R), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints. Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake, not just for the United States of America, but for your own countries.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I love when they pan to the faces, the grim faces. We used to be able to take advantage of Joe Biden, but not you. Well, what specifically was Vance referring to there?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: Many of our most productive tech companies are forced to deal with the EU's Digital Services Act and the massive regulations it created about taking down content and policing so-called misinformation. And of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It's about time that a U.S. official called out Europe's attack on free speech right to their faces. Look, the Europeans aren't even trying to pretend at this point, officials there are openly calling for censorship of American social media companies, including X and Meta. And back in August, remember when Musk was about to interview then candidate Donald Trump on X, an EU commissioner warned about a risk of amplification of potentially harmful content. At the time, I was thinking, harmful to whom? Well, to the global bureaucrats, of course.
So why should American taxpayers continue to subsidize this to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in defense costs when countries that don't protect basic freedoms and their own countries continue on. Well, our new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, also overseas, had another blunt message for our allies. Time to ramp up your military spending and do more to defend yourselves.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The European continent deserves to be free from any aggression, but it ought be those in the neighborhood investing the most in that collective, individual and collective defense. As the President talks a lot about, common sense is, you defend your neighborhood, and the Americans will come alongside you in helping in that defense. Most NATO countries are already close to 2 percent. We believe that needs to be higher.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Yes. In other words, the free ride is over, kids. It's been 80 years since World War II ended, and America is up to her ears in debt. Friends don't let friends drive drunk and friends don't let friends mooch off of them forever. But to the old foreign policy establishment asking Europe to do more, it's always considered an insult and even dangerous because it plays into Putin's hands, don't you know? Well, that's absurd. It's out of step with what most Americans want at this point. But then again, the old guard is so used to foreign policy failure and running roughshod over what the American people actually want that they really can't relate to this innovative approach.
Thus, when Trump floats the idea of taking back the Panama Canal or even figuring out a way to buy Greenland or taking over Gaza, heads explode.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is like a bully in the school yard looking around for someone small to push around. So far, we've had Greenland and Denmark. We've had Canada and Mexico. This is autocratic behavior.
JOSH ROGIN, LEAD ANALYST, WASHINGTON POST INTELLIGENCE: Trump is threatening to further destabilize the region. It's just a disaster. It's kind of a -- it's a disgrace. He's humiliating our allies.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It's a disgrace. But is a U.S. led rebuild of Gaza any crazier than sticking with the status quo? Do they have any ideas for how to deal with that? And how is continuing a massive trade deficit with Canada fair given how much security we provide them? And how is it not insane to give China a foothold in a major shipping lane that we paid for. So if there's one unifying theme behind Trump's approach to other countries, it's this, you're not going to rip us off any longer, and you won't get something for nothing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We were paying almost all of NATO. It was unfair. We take care of the military and then they take advantage of us on trade. You know, they're very tough. I'll tell you what, the EU on trade is horrible. Canada is just about the lowest payer in the whole thing, which is very unfair. You know why they're low payer, because they think the United States is going to take care of them. You think that's fair? It's not fair.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And Ukraine also will need to pay up for the hundreds of billions we spent there. Trump Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is headed to Ukraine for a frank discussion.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: They have tremendously valuable land in terms of rare earth, in terms of oil and gas, in terms of other things. I want to have our money secured because we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. I told them that I want the equivalent like $500 billion worth of rare earth, and they have essentially agreed to do that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So expect a lot of wailing from the free riders and the defenders of the free riders as President Trump puts America first, and as he methodically restores balance to our relationships around the world with pragmatism. But in the end, Europe, Mexico, South America, Australia, they're going to have to decide whether they wish to partner with the United States or be run over by China. Trump's betting they're going to choose to stick with us. And of course, he's right. And that's the Angle.
Joining me now, Peter Navarro, White House Counsel for Trade and Manufacturing. Peter, great to have you on tonight. The faces --
PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING: Good to see you, Laura.
INGRAHAM: -- the faces in the crowd today were hilarious as Vice President Vance spoke about a relationship with Europe. Now Europe is threatening reciprocal tariffs. I know you've heard the comments from Germany and France. Your reaction tonight to what they heard from you all yesterday regarding tariffs.
PETER NAVARRO, TRADE AND MANUFACTURING SENIOR COUNSELOR: Hey, here's an idea. The E.U. runs like hundreds of billions of dollars of a trade surplus every year. Why do they use that money to pay for NATO? Hey, there's an idea. Stop the corporate welfare. Fact is, Laura, they cheat us. You know how many cars they sell us versus how many we sell them? They got a VAT tax, a value-added tax, that works just like a tariff that they've been sticking to us for years. And it's just, I mean, it's such an imbalanced trade relationship.
And what Donald Trump's going to do is he's going to level the playing field, make it fair again, both for national defense and economic security reasons. The steel and aluminum tariffs we did this week are a great start to that. And by the way, the E.U. is a tremendous part of the capacity, over capacity we have in steel and aluminum, and they're dumping it. Their governments are responsible. It's like a billion euros here, three billion there, subsidizing the steel and aluminum industries to attack the United States.
So, these bureaucrats in the crowd, Laura, they don't know what hit them. Donald Trump is moving so fast, he's floating like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
INGRAHAM: Peter, on the issue of trade and steel versus aluminum, we know the steel manufacturing is so critical to America's future. And that's just without a doubt. But the aluminum industry is a little bit different because we only have a few smelters left in the United States. Most of the dirty work is done up in Canada. There are some new technologies I know out there that are emerging that we may or may not support down the road.
But why would 25 percent on aluminum make sense when last time, I think, you all put, what, 10 percent on aluminum, but now it's up to 25? Trying to figure that out.
NAVARRO: Well, the problem we had when we put the tariffs on in 2018, 25 percent for steel, 10 percent for aluminum, they worked beautifully at the time, but what the Biden regime did was give all these country exemptions and product exclusions and capacity utilization, as few foundries as we have is down to 50 percent when it needs to be up at 80.
You make your own case, Laura. We lost two foundries, two big foundries during the Biden years. We can't afford to do that. Remember, in times of crisis, we have to depend on steel and aluminum for our defense needs. So, President Trump is fully confident that a 25 percent tariff will be enough to bring back significant investment here, both domestic investment and foreign investment.
INGRAHAM: Peter, we cannot wait to see the heads continuing to explode as the tariff thing plays out. Great to have you back on the show. Peter, thank you so much. All right, liberals trying to stall President Trump's agenda in court. How the president can fight back. It's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DOANLD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: It seems hard to believe that judges want to try and stop us from looking for corruption, especially when we found hundreds of millions of dollars-worth, much more than that, in just a short period of time. We want to weed out the corruption. And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say, we don't want you to do that. So maybe we have to look at the judges because that's a very serious, I think it's a very serious violation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It's a huge problem. And dozens of legal challenges have been filed against President Trump's efforts to pull back the bureaucracy and enact his agenda. And now court rulings halting that agenda are piling up nationwide in the form of these injunctions that apply across the country, oftentimes handed down by activist judges.
So, this is shaping up to be a battle royale between the judiciary and the executive branch with the White House hinting at times that it may even ignore these injunctions and let the Supreme Court sort it out later.
Joining us now, Chip Roy, who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Congressman, thank you for joining us. What can Congress do, sir, to step in and stop this madness of these activist judges thwarting legitimate executive authority from being exercised?
REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): Yeah, Laura, great to be on. And first of all, the absurdity of the fact that these activist judges are stepping in and trying to tell the President of the United States, who is the chief executive of our government, that he can't have his designees or himself look at information, go down and look and make sure that social security numbers aren't duplicated, go try to expose all of the ridiculous programs that the American people sent him to Washington to expose, tells you how corrupt and how frankly self-important judges think they are.
And they're using and abusing, you know, the Administrative Procedures Act. You're very familiar with it based on your legal background and knowledge. And, you know, they're using that as what arbitrary Capricious standard to say they can do whatever they want. And the fact is, they can't. And that's one of the things, to answer your question, Congress need to take a look at. Whether we amend that statute or change it in some form or fashion.
INGRAHAM: Yes.
ROY: I think it dates back to the, what, 40's or 50's --
INGRAHAM: -- 1946, congressman. Time to change it. It's been totally abused.
ROY: Yeah, totally. And so -- and we got to look at the judges themselves, right? Like review what are these guys doing, and then, how do they think they're empowered to do it. But consider the last administration, Joe Biden, literally put out executive orders telling ICE, you can't even really enforce the law. So, criminals can run amok and endanger Americans, but that's OK.
But the president of the United States, President Trump, wants to go down and look at social security data to make sure it's not being duplicated, so our records aren't being stolen and so we can be protected. And somehow, he's the bad guy?
Or by the way, fire bureaucrats. You got a judge coming in and saying, oh, the president can't fire bureaucrats. Yes, he can. He's the chief executive. Of course he can fire bureaucrats.
INGRAHAM: I mean, he's the boss of the executive branch. Bosses can fire people. So, you got a number of judges, most of them appointed by Democrats, not all, but most of them. You got Paul Engelmeyer in Manhattan. You got George O'Toole in Boston. You got Angel Kelly, I believe, in Rhode Island. So, they're all going to the First Circuit, because I know the First Circuit's totally liberal and they're going to get a good ruling there. And they've already gotten hosed in one of the appellate court rulings earlier today.
But President Trump was pressed on this idea about whether he was going to pull an Andrew Jackson and basically say, make me, to the federal courts. Watch.

UNKNOWN: If a judge does block one of your policies, part of your agenda, will you abide by that ruling? Will you comply with that?
TRUMP: Well, I always abide by the courts, and then I'll have to appeal it. But then what he's done is he's slowed down the momentum. And it gives crooked people more time to cover up the books. You know, if a person's crooked and they get caught, other people see that and all of a sudden it becomes harder later on. So, yeah, the answer is, I always abide by the courts. Always abide by them. And we'll appeal. But appeals take a long time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, Judge Kelly's in Boston, and again, Manhattan, we got Seattle with the -- you know the birthright citizenship is going to be a tougher case for sure. But these -- just enacting your agenda and looking for waste is now something that requires a nationwide injunction to stop. Congress has got to step in on this nationwide injunction issue. I think that should be, that's like right up there with election integrity.
ROY: Well, let's keep in mind, I'm going to be quick here. The president beat law fair when it was going after him when he was a candidate. The president is going to beat this, in my opinion. Yes, I think he should take a page out of Andrew Jackson's playbook.
At some point, J.D. Vance is right. When J.D. said, hold on, you can't have a judge step in when the president is exercising his constitutional authority. Imagine if a judge said, Mr. President, as commander in chief, you can't bomb this particular city or this certain area. You can't do that. You got to give the president the ability to be the chief executive. I hope he'll continue to do that.
Congress, by the way, we need to make its executive orders permanent. We need to pass laws to back up his agenda. We need to go quickly to do that. And then we can stand behind the president. But the president is right to say he'll follow the law, but the constitution matters too. And he can do his job.
INGRAHAM: Runaway judges, Congress and the Supreme Court are going to have to do their job. Congressman, thank you so much.
And who's leaking the information about these ICE raids and what can be done about that? Tom Holman put everybody on notice. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: All right, of all the things that DOGE has discovered, I think what makes people's blood boil is that we somehow managed to spend $59 million on luxury hotels for illegal aliens in New York City. We just learned this, like, in a week. And today, DHS tells us that four FEMA employees were fired over that. Firing includes FEMA's chief financial officer, 2 programs analyst, and a grant specialist.
Joining me now, former acting Homeland Security Secretary, Chad Wolf. Chad have been dying to talk to you about this, along with the people snitching on behalf of the illegals. But is this really true? Did we really spend $59 million for illegal aliens to go to hotels that most Americans can't afford?
CHAD WOLF, FORMER ACTING DHS SECRETARY: I think it's actually far more than that. That's just the most recent payment that was made last week. But if you go back for the four years, you're probably spending millions and millions above that number on transportation, on facilities, on hotels, and everything else that the Biden administration did over those four years to facilitate the largest illegal alien population coming into the United States. So, I think it's actually far worse than that.
INGRAHAM: And you think about if people live around L.A. or New York or D.C., you see tent villages right near the Watergate Hotel, near Georgetown, tents everywhere. And, you know, occasionally, we'll have a chance to interview, and these are veterans, these are people who have mental illness, Americans in trouble, and some of them don't want to live in shelters.
But nevertheless, we have a serious homelessness problem in the United States. And yet, hundreds of millions, I guess, going to the illegals. This is insanity. This is why Trump won. This is a big reason why Trump won. They knew this was going on.
WOLF: Yeah, absolutely. This is, you know, what you described there as an America last approach to taking care of U.S. citizens, and making sure that you care more about illegal aliens than you do about veterans and others here.
And of course, President Trump feels the very opposite of that and has that America First, sort of, imprint on his mind and everything that he does. That's why they're clawing back this money, as they should. That's why they're firing employees, as they should. This is about accountability and transparency.
And I think that's what the American people want from this issue to any every and other issue that Doge and others are uncovering, they want accountability. The American people want accountability, and they're getting it.
INGRAHAM: And the snitches that are alerting the illegal aliens and the gang members to the raids, what can be done there, anything?
WOLF: Well, absolutely. You can hold them accountable as well. So, you can investigate. And if you find them, you've got to prosecute them. And it's not just irresponsible what they're doing. It's criminal what they're doing because it's putting officers, law enforcement officers' lives in danger if you're tipping off the bad folks as they come in and to do an operation.
So, that is also about accountability. Again, I think it sends a strong signal if you can identify and then prosecute.
INGRAHAM: Yeah, make them pay for that. Chad, as always, thank you. All right, we come back. A rap battle extraordinaire. Elon Musk versus Sam Altman. Failla, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Now it's time for WTF, What the Failla? Joining me now, Jimmy Failla, host of Fox News Saturday night. All right, Jimmy, we're watching the battle of the billionaires unfold. OK, so this investors group backed by Elon Musk is trying to buy open AI from CEO Sam Altman.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Open AI is not for sale. The open admission is not for sale. Elon tries all sorts of things for a long time.
UNKNOWN: Do you think Musk's approach then is from a position of insecurity about XAI?
UNKNOWN: Probably his whole life is from a position of insecurity, I feel for the guy.
UNKNOWN: You feel for him?
UNKNOWN: I do, actually. I don't think he's like a happy person, I do feel for him.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Seem pretty happy today, Jimmy. I don't know. He seems pretty happy with his son, like, giving us a tutorial in the Oval. He was very happy.
JIMMY FAILLA, FOX NEWS SATURDAY HOST: Yeah, to be fair, I mean, let's be honest. If you look at Sam Altman, he has the look of a guy who's upset that Elon canceled the drag shows in Ecuador. OK. Doesn't he look like the guy who he'd be in the front row with a wad of singles making it rain? And that's who's unhappy here. I mean you. I mean, obviously, he can afford 20's or maybe even more.
But that's who he is. He's kind of a dork and he has, you know, access issues because Elon has the president's ear. That obviously matters quite a bit to him. But let's be clear, Laura. Anybody who's changing their name to Harry Balls is having a good time, OK?
INGRAHAM: OK, we got to explain this to people. So, he changed his Twitter or X handle to H-A-R-R-Y, V-O-L-Z. OK. He does this. He likes to have fun because he's, you know, he is a happy person. He likes to have fun.
But all of these serious liberal feminist tech writers were over at CNN, they were, oh, they thought that was like the ultimate, you know, misogynist power move, Jimmy. It's just funny.
FAILLA: I loved it. Especially after they freak out because, of course, he had a DOGE member with the nickname, Big Balls, and liberals hated that because they think Big Balls belongs in women's swimming. So, they weren't going to have that. They couldn't have bought it. Couldn't buy.
INGRAHAM: Jimmy, you've seen all the protests, I know, the DOGE protests. You've been there with your pink hat on. Well, one of them took a turn today. Check it out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: We do have to -- I don't swear in public very well. But we have to (BLEEP) Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: We don't want to swear, but we have to, hmm, Trump. They don't even know how to curse.
FAILLA: Yeah, they don't know what they're doing. This is not as bad at the time Chuck Schumer said Donald Trump inspired the erection. I believe Chuck was thinking about January 6 inches that day. But the Democrats just aren't good at this opposition thing, because Trump has the crowd on his side. So, all they can do is curse in the wrong ways. This is embarrassing.
INGRAHAM: I'm going to say -- the crowds seem to be thinning. There's not enough AstroTurf around for them to pay for more protesters. But Jimmy, I want everyone to grab tickets for your Jimmy's Everybody Calm Down tour in Royal Oak, Michigan, Friday, February 21st at foxacrossamerica.com. So, everyone go get it. Thank you, Jimmy.
As always, that's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media. Big snowstorm is at least three inches here in Washington. Jesse Watters next.
