President Trump welcomed celebrities and voters alike to the White House on Thursday for an event celebrating Black History Month. 
Flanked by golfer Tiger Woods and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Trump said the event was to “pay tribute to the generations of Black legends, champions, warriors that helped drive our country forward.”
“The last administration tried to reduce all of American history to a single year, 1619, but under our administration, we honor the indispensable role Black Americans have always played in the immortal cause of another date: 1776,” Trump said. 
Trump went in to share the story of Prince Estabrooks, an enslaved Black man who became the first African American soldier to fight in the American Revolution. 
Trump added that Brooks would be honored with a statue in the new National Garden of American heroes along with revolutionaries like Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Athletes like Muhammad Ali and Kobe Bryant will also be in the gardens, Trump said. 
“We’ve made tribute to these heroes and so many others, but not simply because they’re Black heroes, but also because they are truly American heroes who inspire all of us very much,” Trump said. 
Though the event is an annual tradition, this year’s event was against the backdrop of the administration’s attempts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion in the federal and corporate world. 
Trump has called DEI programs discriminatory, signing executive orders to bar directing . He claims his administration is focused on building a meritocracy. 
But the moves have sparked backlash and lawsuits, with DEI advocates arguing such policies ensure qualified minority candidates are not overlooked. Some have also voiced concerns over how things like Black history will be taught in schools if DEI is eliminated. 
During her confirmation hearing to lead the Department of Education last week, Linda McMahon acknowledged that though events celebrating King would be permitted in public schools, she was unsure about African American history classes.
Still, those gathered in the East Room, indicated their support for the 47th president. 
At one point, Trump informed the crowd that he won the most Black voter support in 2024 than any other Republican presidential candidate. He then asked if he should seek a third term, though legally he is restricted to only two. 
But the crowd immediately broke into applause and cheers and began chanting, “Four more years! Four more years!”
Noticeably but unsurprisingly absent were any members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who are all Democrats. Former President Biden last year acknowledged the caucus in his remarks; Trump this year did not. 
Trump did praise Elon Musk in his remarks, though the South African businessman received lukewarm applause. He also gave a shout-out to the CEO of Pfizer, who received a chorus of boos from the crowd. 
But Trump also thanked those gathered for supporting him over the last four weeks. 
“One of the big reasons I’m president today is because of the Black vote, and I always appreciate it,” Trump said. “This is a very special time. It’s Black History Month. We love you all, we’re going to work with you. We’re gonna make America greater than ever before and we’re gonna do it together.”
