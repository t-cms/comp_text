SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left tonight. Please set your DVR so you never, ever miss an episode of Hannity. For news anytime, every time, all the time, foxnews.com, hannity.com.
In the meantime, Greg Gutfeld is next. He'll put a smile on your face. Kevin Corke will recap all of tonight's breaking news at 11:00 p.m. Have a great weekend.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you. Thank you.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Thank you. I'd like to thank each and every one of you right now. No, kidding. Good evening, everyone.
Kamala Harris reportedly consulted Hillary Clinton multiple times on dealing with her crushing loss in the 2024 election, which gave both her husbands' time to go out and bang some whores.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Harris reportedly asked Hillary for advice on what to do after losing to Trump. Well, you know what always cheers me up when I'm feeling down, said Hillary, murder --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: -- and then disguising it as suicide.
Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker is being mocked by sports fans for her inability to spell the word "Eagles". When asked to spell the 76ers, she said, I can't do math either.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: As you already know, Trump has declared that there are only two genders, but if you are confused about which gender you are, one man volunteered to take a look.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: I get two cigars in there.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Kamala Harris has established a new company called Pioneer49. She says it's a combination of her Secret Service code name and the number of states there are.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Oscar nominations were just announced. As usual, Nancy Pelosi's face is favored to win for "Best Special Effects".
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Spirit Airlines has introduced a new dress code for passengers that will ban skimpy outfits. Guess it means you're flying Frontier, Larry,
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Fly high, Kudlow.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: According to a new study, over the past century, men have increased in size twice as fast as women, with one exception.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Too easy, but accurate. And in case you're wondering, it still freezing in New York City. It's so cold, even the chalk body outlines in the park are shivering.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Ex-POLITICO reporters revealed that editors would deliberately kill any stories that were negative about Biden. Current POLITICO reporters have been told not to report this.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Trump signed an executive order declassifying the files on the assassinations of MLK --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: -- applauding assassinations, that's novel, but the assassinations of MLK, RFK and JFK. Still no word on who killed ALF.
(LAUGHTER)
DAGEN MCDOWELL, CO-HOST, "THE BOTTOM LINE": He is dead.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TYRUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: OK. Really?
GUTFELD: In his crackdown on illegal immigration, Trump's ICE raid has turned up a number of suspected pedophiles, which will no doubt delay Hollywood summer blockbusters.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
TYRUS: Good point.
GUTFELD: Scientists have created an artificial tongue that uses AI to detect food spoilage and contamination. The tongue can also detect very lonely scientists.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: DOGE wants to stop minting pennies, arguing it costs three cents to produce a one cent coin, but without pennies, a few critics wonder how they'll be able to tip their waitress.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Actor Benedict Cumberbatch revealed that while filming a show in South Africa he was kidnapped by six men and bound for hours. Where do I sign up, asked one man.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Still a punch line, the unemployment and the punch line.
As you know, President Trump announced that the Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the Gulf of America, but also adds that Mexico will be known as diarrhea land.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I'd definitely go to that amusement park.
And finally, here is an odd story. A teen was busted by his angry mom for waiting in line to have sex with a porn star. She said, wait till your father hears about this. He is in the back of the line.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: All right, to the monolog.
So, in his first week, we saw Trump fulfill 46 promises in roughly 24 hours. That's two an hour, give or take a few. And just as a comparison, the only thing Biden did twice an hour was pee.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So, Trump hit the ground running, while Biden just hit the ground, face first. Trump's actions include giving DHS and Border Patrol the green light to deport illegals, eliminating DEI from all government programs, ending remote work for federal employees, designating two and only two genders, i.e., protecting women's sports, and of course, releasing the assassination files. So, was this hard? Not at all. It was easier than beating Stephen Hawking in a game of Twister.
TYRUS: What? You thought he was good?
GUTFELD: And why? Well, I bet Trump sees them all as all solvable problems.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: They're all solvable problems.
HANNITY: I agree.
TRUMP: They're all solvable --
HANNITY: Not easy.
TRUMP: -- with time, effort, money, unfortunately, but they're all solvable problems. We can get our country back. But, if we didn't win this race, I really believe our country would have been lost forever. I think we got there just in the nick of time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: You know, he is right. The problems are solvable if you view them as problems. This is why they weren't solvable under Democrats. They were not problems to them, but eggs they were willing to break to make their toxic omelet. The Dems did nothing about the gangs or crime and other obvious stuff, because they lost the ability to admit something was wrong. Why would they miss such obvious fixes? Maybe because the problems were part of the plan, and in some cases, not solving a problem kept their so- called problem solvers in business, the race-baiters, the climate hucksters, the DEI department heads. If they preserved a problem or made it worse, then you couldn't get rid of them. As long as we had racial divisions, Al Sharpton got paid. As long as John Kerry spoke of the dangers of CO2, he could fly private around the globe stealing more noxious gases than Jerry Nadler in the Capitol men's room --
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
TYRUS: Jesus.
GUTFELD: -- after a bowl of bad clams.
TYRUS: OK.
GUTFELD: And why was America First so hard to understand? Perhaps they heard, oh, America is better than everyone else, and that pissed them off. But, America First doesn't put the country above others any more than putting your family first, means it's better than other families. It's just the top priority. This could be why liberals are hated by their kin. They'd rather save the smell than visit grandma. And now both Republicans and Democrats look at what Trump is doing, and they think, Wow, this wasn't that hard. Why didn't this happen before? Well, because either they didn't want it or didn't have the balls to do it. Now we got a guy who does.
But, the ease at which these changes are accepted, it speaks to the degradation of a country previously under no leadership. Trump's effectiveness mirrors in scale and scope, the absolute treasonous desertion of presidential duties by the Biden White House. In a way, Trump has got it easy. With the Biden White House so callow and inept, the problems it created, although vast and serious, were actually easy to correct, as long as you're normal. For Trump, following the Biden administration is like following your dog with a pooper scooper.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: How ironic the person in the media deemed irrational, even nuts, is doing the things every sane person needs, but we've been gaslit so long that normal seems crazy. So, in this case, the inmates should be running the asylum. And so, all of Trump's actions are obvious, just free money on the table to be scooped up by the one guy who saw it sitting there. It makes you wonder, how long would this dissent into madness have continued if Kamala had won? Now, right now, she'd be trying to get into legal on death row, a pair of fake (BEEP) on the taxpayers' dime.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So, it's like America was driving down the road with its tires completely worn down, sparks shooting out of the rims with Jim -- Joe -- Jim is his brother, asleep at the wheel. Democrats pretended not to notice, but Trump jumped in, grabbed the wheel and pulled the car over just in time.
So, when the media describes Trump's actions on crime or the border or federal workers as a crackdown, it's not. It's a correction, and that makes the crimes of the previous administration so much worse. They had the chance to follow the law. They didn't. So, it wasn't just a failure of common sense, it was a failure of will, and that inaction should never be forgotten, but they should be, and the only thing we need to remember is never to vote for them again.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Let's welcome tonight's guest. She hosts "The Bottom Line" when she is not smuggling moonshine, Fox Business anchor Dagen McDowell.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: He is like Rosie Perez, except his name is Lou, comedian Lou Perez.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Her points are profound, and her bellies round, New York Times best-selling author and Fox News contributor, Kat Timpf.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: And he flosses with a live Python, New York Times best-selling author, comedian, and former NWA World Champion, Tyrus.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Dagen, I think that, you know, for one thing, it seems like Trump has filled the space of all politics by doing this, by doing all of these executive actions. But, I keep thinking, the presence of Trump tells you what the absence was. Like, all of these -- nobody is coming out against these actions because they all make sense, and they're so obvious. We're just following the law. So, it tells you what was missing, right?
MCDOWELL: Right. There is even virtually no pushback with the ICE raids.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MCDOWELL: You have heard almost no left-wing caterwauling about, well, odd, you know, dangerous rapists and murderers who should not be in the country, being arrested and sent out of the United States, but it's after the pathological dishonesty of Joe Biden and the incompetence and the sadism and not the fun kind, you know --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MCDOWELL: -- the Cat o' Nine Tails sadism that it makes what Trump is doing so astonishing, that he is honoring his promises in just a matter of days, each and every one, and that goes against, really, humankind, well, politician kind, and certainly any man I've ever known, biblically, like, you know, (inaudible) enough, I'll call you later, nothing --
GUTFELD: Nothing.
MCDOWELL: -- or, you know, I'll take you somewhere nice for your birthday, Dave & Buster's. I don't like going to eat places where everything is sticky.
GUTFELD: Yeah. I remember I went out on a date and I took her to Dave & Buster's. It was two guys I knew down the street. All right, Pete. TYRUS: I don't know. I just like to say for the record, I like Dave & Buster's.
(LAUGHTER)
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Are you filled?
TYRUS: There is a lot of fun.
TIMPF: Are you filled? There is a lot fun.
GUTFELD: A lot of games to play in there, Lou. Some of these actions are immediate, but some, like, it's going to be a challenge to undo a lot of the consequences, like the DEI stuff. There are people that are hired now. You can't fire them and get rid of the office, but you can't get rid of the hires.
LOU PEREZ, COMEDIAN: Yeah. It's really interesting, because with -- when the Democrats were in control, it was basically ruled by executive order. And it's like, they didn't think, like, hey, in four years, we could be ruled by or overruled --
GUTFELD: Right.
PEREZ: -- by executive order, and with a lot of these, like -- I'm a fan of a lot of the executive orders. The one that I have a problem with is recognizing the gender of male and female, because that means that now it's illegal for me to use the women's restroom --
(LAUGHTER)
PEREZ: -- or a women's prison, and it's just -- and I just feel like I'm being erased --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
PEREZ: -- in a way like that.
GUTFELD: Have you ever used a woman's bathroom? It is unusual, isn't it? It's often dirtier than you think.
PEREZ: It is, and I go -- it's filthy.
TIMPF: It's way dirtier.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: It's so disgusting. Just sit -- ladies, just sit. If you would sit, we all could sit.
PEREZ: It's a terrible place for a date.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PEREZ: It's a --
MCDOWELL: That's --
TIMPF: I -- that's my --
MCDOWELL: -- that my campaign slogan.
TIMPF: Yes.
MCDOWELL: Stop the spray.
TIMPF: Yes. With the bathroom -- the bathrooms actually should be split into sit and not going to sit, because I am so sick of cleaning up other people's piss. It's also not good for your bladder. So, clearly, only care about yourself. Then if you care about your bladder, you should sit.
GUTFELD: All right. Well, I'm glad we covered that.
TYRUS: Yeah.
TIMPF: No. We --
GUTFELD: Kat --
TIMPF: Yes.
GUTFELD: -- I'm going to ask you about these assassination documents. Do you think -- where -- how are we going to find out -- where are they going to be released, and will it be so redacted?
TIMPF: That's the thing.
GUTFELD: Like, JFK was killed by redacting.
TIMPF: Yeah. That's the thing, is I am excited about it, but it's like I'm excited about it in the same way that I always get hosts getting excited about when I see a trailer for a season of the Reality TV that I watch --
GUTFELD: Right.
TIMPF: -- because I'm like, this looks juicy. I'm so excited to see this drama, and then you realize it's been like edited in such a way that you're not even get to see any of the good stuff.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: So, am I excited? Yes. Do I think I'm going to be disappointed? Yes. I will say, though, that I'm very pleasantly surprised that he did the Free Ross.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: He actually did -- I mean, he didn't do day one, but it was pretty damn close, and I wasn't really sure he was going to actually do that.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: I think that that's really awesome.
GUTFELD: I can't believe that guy got like multiple life terms. I didn't read enough about, what's -- what was that website?
TIMPF: Silk Road.
GUTFELD: Silk Road. I don't know enough about it, but, like, basically, they were saying he was guilty of everything that people did on the website.
TIMPF: On the website, which --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: -- that should never be the case, and it isn't with other things.
GUTFELD: Thank God, because my website, people do terrible things on there. Tyrus, what kills me, I think that like a lot of these executive orders, specifically the immigration ones, they're not you. They're just enforcing existing laws. So, it's no wonder like people going, oh, yeah, that makes sense.
TYRUS: Well, no, what they're trying to do is, I watched a lot of the so- called pundits from the Democrats, like, oh, we were doing that. We were doing that. And one guy was like, oh, big deal. You arrested 350 murderers --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: -- and pedophiles and rapists. There is -- what about the 10 million other illegal aliens that didn't do anything wrong? And I was like, stupid. Say what you just said again.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: They broke the law. Like, they -- their pushback is different because they haven't found the way yet to connect this to Hitler.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: It's going to be -- they need one deportee to get to the line of Mexico and be like --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: -- and they'll be like, Ha-ha, Hitler. So, there -- they just haven't found a way. They don't have the skill set. It's not their fault. Their best and brightest couldn't speak or remember. So, it's going to take them a while before they could come with the opposition, and it's hard when you -- the people around you are like, Man, I'm going to sleep a lot better tonight knowing that in my neighborhood, the 16 wanted murderers and rapists are no longer going to be here, and they're like, Well, yeah, but a misogynist is the one who arrested him.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: This is why you're not allowed in my yard.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: All right. Up next, Harris asked Bill Clinton's boss how she handled her loss.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A story in 5 words.
GUTFELD: Kamala gets advice from Hillary. So, Lou, check this out. In the wake of her loss to Donald Trump, Kamala Harris has reached out, reportedly, to allies for advice, including someone who knows this sting of defeat, Hillary Clinton. How do you think that conversation went?
PEREZ: Well, I bet Hillary enjoyed seeing a woman who got beat worse than she did --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
PEREZ: -- by Donald Trump. If she is given advice, I bet she is telling Kamala, like, just have another drink and keep drinking. Just black out for the next four years and then come back just drunker and stronger.
GUTFELD: Yeah. Act like it never happened. Like, when you black out --
PEREZ: Yeah.
GUTFELD: -- I don't know. What do you mean I fell down the stairs naked? That wasn't me, Kat.
All right, Kat. They've spoken several times, and she has got, what, an uncertain future, and I think she looks for Hillary for guidance. Is that the best person to seek guidance from, and maybe perhaps wearing Moo Moos at events? I love a good muumuu, airy. Shoplifting is easy. Yes?
TIMPF: No.
GUTFELD: No?
TIMPF: I don't think so, because it's actually almost remarkable Hillary's complete inability --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: -- or refusal to move on --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: -- at all. So, I don't know what she is asking her for advice, and what do I do after this? Hillary is going to say, nothing. This is your life now.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: That's -- what other advice could she give? What you do is you talk about this forever, and whenever anyone tries to talk about anything else, you (BEEP) refuse to do that.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: OK? And if anybody ever suggests that you should, that person is the problem. You are not the problem. You did nothing wrong. This is your -- I mean, they could just do that all day.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: I understand there is some period where you want to commiserate and I understand not wanting to get back out there right away after something so tough. But, this is the next generation of lady who lost to Trump, and Hillary is still not giving up her seat to letting it go.
GUTFELD: Yeah. That is true. It's almost like an encounter group, women beaten by Trump meets every Thursday night.
TYRUS: Yeah.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Face church basement.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Free coffee, free coffee.
TYRUS, Well, thanks to you, and now I'm not worried about what I was about to say. I don't think this was a fun conversation for either one. I think it was, you think that's bad. You think that's bad.
I think originally she called her for, say you have an annoying husband who cost you the election. How would you get him to accidentally suicide himself? That might have been how the conversation started. And then it was, well, you think it's that bad. What if your husband has so much Secret Service you can't get next to him? Oh, girl, man, I didn't even think about that. And she was like, well, you know, I lost, you lost, and then Hillary, to be Hillary, she is like, but at least I wasn't black and lost. I mean, you check two boxes. That should have been a home run. How are you black and a woman in a woke society and lose? Like, I was feeling bad about myself, but I was like, at least I wasn't the black lady.
GUTFELD: It's actually a good point.
TYRUS: Yeah.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
TYRUS: And then Kamala is like (inaudible), and then Hillary said, you know what? We should do a Netflix special together called the cool white woman who sits next to the black woman who lost to Hitler.
GUTFELD: You lost to Hitler. Yeah. I find it interesting that Hillary, Dagen, and Harris were portrayed as forces for women's freedom, but they were both absent when the fight was over actual women's spaces. Meanwhile, the President, this CAD (ph), right, this lothario, is the one who bans men from women's space. He has done more for feminism, second-wave feminism, if you will, than those two. That's got to sting.
MCDOWELL: Yes.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
MCDOWELL: XX, baby.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MCDOWELL: Oh, that's offensive. I'm sorry. Not anymore. It's not -- when they used the word advice, I thought, what would you actually go to angsty bitch bags for advice on? It's a flourishing TV career? No.
GUTFELD: No.
MCDOWELL: Skin care tips? Nope. How to keep your man satisfied and at home? The only thing that I could figure out is Kamala is trying to make herself feel better by rubbing (BEEP) in because, Kamala, at least, was on a ticket that beat President Trump, not so much Hillary Clinton.
GUTFELD: No. That's true.
MCDOWELL: Hillary Clinton has never been on a ticket -- winning ticket. Hillary Clinton has never even really been in the White House, other than being --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MCDOWELL: -- the home slice.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MCDOWELL: So, she wrote -- she probably is trying to make herself feel better.
GUTFELD: They both, though, do have something to come. They both have annoying daughters, right? I mean, what was that? What was her Hillary's kid's name? Brad? Chelsea, and then you got that Emhoff thing.
MCDOWELL: Ella.
GUTFELD: Ella, yeah, I don't
TYRUS: I don't know, Dagen. I don't know if I would brag, because my boss had dementia and I couldn't outsmart him and take his job.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: All right.
TYRUS: On Kamala's side. Like --
GUTFELD: We shall move to the next segment. POLITICO was hiding negative stories about Biden.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five more words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Reporters were just following orders.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, "Politico", my former employer, and I knew at the time, dint' do itself any favors. I was covering Biden at the time and I remember coming to my editors and saying, hey, we need to write about the Hunter Biden laptop. And I was told, this came from on high at "Politico", don't write about the laptop, don't talk about laptop, and don't tweet about the laptop.
In 2019, a rival presidential Democratic campaign of Joe Biden's gave to me the tax lien, the oppo research, the tax lien on Hunter Biden for the period of time that he worked at Burisma, and I wrote what would have been a classic story. That story was killed by the editors.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So now they find their integrity, Kat. Now they talk about it. They could have shared the risk with other reporters and defended "The New York Post" over the laptop story, but they didn't.
TIMPF: It's giving -- you know what it's giving. It's giving when the girl's boyfriend breaks up with her, and finally you get to hear all the stuff that she has been hiding about him the whole time they were together.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: Where you never liked him. She's like, he really didn't come to your birthday, he wasn't sick. He thought you were annoying, he didn't like you.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: Or, he actually didn't buy me anything. I had to pay for every trip, but I found out he was spending money on OnlyFans girls. You get to find out the truth only after they've separated. It's such a human thing. But it is really annoying because all of us have known this the entire time.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: And you would get called out as being crazy, or, oh, you're so right -- you're rightwing extremists for noticing the fact that all of these stories are slanted one way. All of these things that other people are covering, you're not covering. It just makes you an observer to have noticed that this was the case. But that's -- he's like having that little moment of, like, the gals -- the gals at brunch moment. And that's what he's having right now. And I guess better late than never, but anybody who has been paying attention, we knew this already.
GUTFELD: Exactly.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: He says, Tyrus, the orders came from up high on "Politico". How high --
TYRUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The highest mountain. The Lord himself.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Said through Jebidiah down the aisle.
GUTFELD: It's a -- website.
TYRUS: And he didn't want to risk losing his job, because here is the stupid part, genius. If you would've went to X and printed and told your story, you would have been on a certain network probably every night for a long time, and probably would have been asked to do guest speaking, and you would have made money, and probably would be sitting next to Trace Gallagher at 11:00, as a man who is a true journalist. But you didn't do that. You kept the little secret, like little babies all tight inside.
GUTFELD: They're talking about this now that they no longer have skin in the game. You -- it's not called sharing the risk when there's no risk. That's what pisses me off.
MCDOWELL: Right. But the fact that they're acting like this is some great confessional that they're having is proof that you can't smell your own B.O.
GUTFELD: Yes.
MCDOWELL: Proof that you can't smell the poo on your shoe.
GUTFELD: Oh, I can.
MCDOWELL: Because they're doomed to do it again for a job with -- at a title, and to be accepted by those odious bootlickers who inhabit the Washington D.C. press core. They would do it all over again, and we would ignore you the same way we have ignored you before, and now and in the future, you jackass.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Lou, I maintain that the person that, this came from the White House to "Politico". Because I can't believe -- I worked in magazines. You've got to give me a reason why I can't write this. It came from something else, which makes this story even more, like, worthy of investigation.
PEREZ: Well, also, I think if they're being honest, they should realize that they played a big role, basically, in the campaign. They wanted Joe Biden to be president.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PEREZ: And now they get to use this excuse, looking back, like, oh, yes, my editor, he said -- my editor said, don't talk about the laptop, don't tweet about the laptop, don't take your laptop out and write on your laptop what's going on and then deliver that via any way to get out there. It's like, look, you guys wanted your man to win. You did what you could, you were part of the team. And now you're looking back, and there's regrets.
GUTFELD: It wasn't my fault. They told me to do it. That's not good enough.
TYRUS: It drives me crazy, Greg. These are DEI appointees that you can't outsmart? Like, what if we wrote it in past tense?
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: You know what I'm saying. You could have tricked them.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, up next, time to cut the tag on taxpayer swag.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the --?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE) GUTFELD: Tonight on "WTF," billions in taxes for candy and comic books. Tyrus, DOGE is targeting promotional items used to advertise federal agencies, these are like coloring books, comic books, shirts, hats, mascots, and candy and toys. It costs taxpayers $2 billion a year for this government swag. Could this be the actual best stuff they're spending money on?
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: I think if I was a DEI hire, I'd be really upset. They're taking away our jobs and our toys and our literature. I need my comic book on how the federal government works. Yes, this needs to go. This is ridiculous. But when people hear this stuff, you're starting to see the same expression, no matter what walk of -- you sit there and they go --
GUTFELD: Yes.
TYRUS: No. Like, yes, and it's only, like, day three.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Like, we haven't even got into the mix. We haven't found out how much lunch costs for the little darlings.
GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.
TYRUS: You know what I'm saying? Their vamoose lattes, vegan salads, I got a crazy feeling that costs, like, $4 trillion. You know what I'm saying? I feel like the more we see this, we actually might get a tax -- we might actually see the Bill Clinton -- we got extra sending it back.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TYRUS: Because if you're just finding out that candy is overpriced, oh, I can't wait until we get to staplers and pens and stuff.
GUTFELD: Yes. You know, Dagen, you know who is exempt from this is Smokey the Bear. After what happened in L.A., I mean --
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: -- shouldn't he be fired? How much money can we save if we told Smokey the Bear to hit the road?
MCDOWELL: Yes. All of the mascots.
GUTFELD: Yes.
MCDOWELL: These people are kiddy terrorists.
GUTFELD: Yes!
MCDOWELL: They are frightening children, because that's all mascots do. And also Woodsy is Owl is exempt. What is this Vin Vasive? It's a Department of Agriculture mascot used to alert the public about the scourge of pests and vines. There are all these mascots. It's like a bunch of Mayor McCheeses meant to terrorize kids.
TYRUS: He looks like a cricket rapist.
GUTFELD: Yes, cricket rapists tonight starting at 9:00, starring Don Knotts.
TYRUS: Chirp, chirp.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Lou, basically this is propaganda. The government puts out propaganda for the government. Like, they did stuff on the theory of COVID. And we're paying for the propaganda that is used on us.
PEREZ: Yes. And, I mean, with the mascots, they look like DEI mascots. There is no way anybody would come up with these ideas. You were bringing up that one character who has monkeypox.
(LAUGHTER)
PEREZ: And you have Owly, Sky Warned (ph), and Sanctuary Sam, who are obviously in a gay relationship.
(LAUGHTER)
PEREZ: I don't know how, because one of them is a cartoon owl and the other is a sealion, but somehow they're making it work.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes.
PEREZ: Who is this working on? Who is the propaganda working on?
GUTFELD: Well, the owl better be on top, that's all I'm saying.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Well, Smokey the Bear should sue. They made him work topless for decades.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yep. Objectified by a lot of park rangers, that's for sure. Hey, baby, where you going?
TYRUS: You got time for pants, but no blouse?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Kat, last word to you. This must make your blood boil.
TIMPF: It does. First of all, it's not -- nobody who is -- it's a merch guy. It's like a merch guy for the government that we are paying. And you're not the most creative or best merch guy if you're working for the government. You take our money, you have an forcible ability the take our money, and then you're using it to then make some sort of merch or promotional materials to convince us that it's a good idea that you took our money. Shut it all down. Shut all of it down.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: All right, up next, viewer mail.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yep, you are watching Mailing It In.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: First question from Danielle. "If you could sign an executive order," choose your executive order, "what would it be?" Dagen?
MCDOWELL: Well, seriously renaming Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, number one. And --
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: What's it called now?
MCDOWELL: Fort Liberty or some -- like that.
(LAUGHTER)
MCDOWELL: Renaming Washington D.C. the Commode.
(LAUGHTER)
MCDOWELL: Just naming it that.
GUTFELD: Fort Bragg is so great, they should change the name to Fort not to Bragg.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Lou, what do you say?
PEREZ: I would make an executive order to say that you're not allowed to claim you can't lose weight unless you're able to show us everything that you've eaten for a week.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That would be hard to enforce.
PEREZ: It would be.
GUTFELD: But it would be fun to enforce.
I know, Kat, executive order.
TIMPF: It's tough. Like, I'd want to probably just shut a bunch of things down.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: Probably make it -- I don't know. Like, if -- do I have values in this situation or am I just being completely self-serving?
GUTFELD: I would say self-serving.
TIMPF: Yes, I don't know.
GUTFELD: For a change of pace.
TIMPF: Yes, I would preemptively -- for that, oh, man, I don't know. I'd make it illegal for you to talk -- to me.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That is not libertarian.
TIMPF: No. Well, you just said -- yes.
TYRUS: Kat-arian.
GUTFELD: All right, Tyrus?
TYRUS: The first thing you want to say is term limits. But --
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: But I'm not really thinking about you all right now. I would like to have an executive order that says that if I feel justified, that I can punch somebody in the face. Like, I have a very good reason. Like, I have a very good reason. There is no reason to call the law.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: He clearly earned it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TYRUS: It was the third big joke of the night, and I punched him. That's it.
GUTFELD: I was thinking, after the inauguration and everything, why is our nation's capital the worst city in the country? My executive order would be to move the capital or re -- or redesignate the capital to a city that we like. Like Milpitas, California, or, I don't know Scarsdale.
MCDOWELL: Cincinnati.
GUTFELD: Yonkers, Yonkers. Actually, someplace in Hawaii. That way, when FOX has to do the inauguration, we all have to do to Hawaii.
(LAUGHTER)
PEREZ: You all get lei-ed.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: All right, here is a similar question, but this is kind of like Musk, if you had Musk's ear. "What large scale idea of yours do you know would be a huge success, if only Elon Musk would finance it?" So you're in an elevator with Elon Musk, you have this amazing idea. What would it be, Lou?
PEREZ: Um, um, um, I'm -- finance me. Just give me money. I think something with constitutional carry. That's just out of nowhere. I think arming people would go well.
GUTFELD: You know what, for him, he would go, what about a chip that is in your body that turns into a gun.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: so there is no choice. There is no choice.
PEREZ: Super cool. Super cool.
GUTFELD: It'd be super cool. And they can't arrest you because it's in your body.
PEREZ: How about a fart machine.
GUTFELD: An internal gun. An internal gun, Kat. Large scale idea, big idea.
TIMPF: Doesn't he love getting people pregnant?
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: He, like, loves it more than anything.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: So I think I would have a really good shot, because I'd be like, look, I'm repopulating the earth. Can I have $3 million? I think he probably would say, good job, here you go.
GUTFELD: That's an interesting way, just asking for $3 million.
TIMPF: That's nothing. That's like someone asking me for a dollar.
GUTFELD: Yes, that's true.
MCDOWELL: I would ask for his sperm and then sell it.
TIMPF: I think he gives it away for free.
(LAUGHTER)
MCDOWELL: Good point.
GUTFELD: Big, large scale idea, Tyrus.
TYRUS: I would ask for funding after my executive order runs out so I could still punch people.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: But you could also be, listen to how many people I got pregnant. Can I have $3 million?
TYRUS: Yes. And he'd be like, oh, you need to pick it up a pace.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Dagen?
MCDOWELL: That was my big idea. Rocket shoes. Rocket shoes.
GUTFELD: Oh, rocket shoes.
TIMPF: You win.
GUTFELD: Interesting. All right, we've got to move on. Don't go away, we'll be right back.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Out of time. Dagen McDowell, Lou Perez, Kat Timpf, Tyrus, our studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
