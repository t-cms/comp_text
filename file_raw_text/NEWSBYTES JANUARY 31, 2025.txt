VA Expands Veterans Legacy Memorial
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has expanded its Veterans Legacy Memorial (VLM) platform, now allowing living veterans to document and share their life stories. Originally created to honor deceased veterans, the VLM has grown into the largest repository of veteran memories and service records. This new feature enables veterans to upload personal narratives, photos, and memorabilia, contributing to the historical record for future generations.
Veterans can access this new feature through the "Your Story, Your Legacy" page on the VLM website at . Since its launch in 2019, the platform has collected over 165,000 submissions, and now encourages veterans to share their own stories. Content will be moderated by the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) to ensure compliance with VLM guidelines.
Acting Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs Ronald Walters emphasized the significance of this update, noting that it allows veterans to preserve their stories for posterity. The VLM now serves not only as a memorial for the deceased but as a living archive where veterans can document their service, achievements, and personal reflections.
For more information or assistance, veterans can visit the Veterans Legacy Memorial website or use the VA's chatbot at  to navigate available benefits and services. This expansion reflects the VA's commitment to honoring veterans in a personal and lasting way, ensuring their stories are preserved for future generations.
Pete Hegseth Confirmed SecDef
Pete Hegseth's confirmation as Secretary of Defense was contentious, passing narrowly with a 50-50 Senate vote, broken by Vice President JD Vance's deciding vote on January 24, 2025. Despite facing allegations of past misconduct, Hegseth was sworn in the following day in a simple yet purposeful ceremony.
Held at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the swearing-in was attended by close family and key Republican figures. Vice President Vance administered the oath of office. In his first address, Hegseth emphasized a return to traditional military values, promising to revive the "warrior ethos" and prioritize combat readiness.
Immediately after taking office, Hegseth enacted significant changes. He issued an order to dismantle all Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs within the Department of Defense, aligning with President Trump's executive orders to refocus the military on its core mission, distancing it from social policies. Hegseth made it clear that failure to comply with this directive would result in job termination, signaling a strict enforcement approach.
Additionally, Hegseth has backed the use of military personnel for border security, reinforcing President Trump's immigration control policies. His early tenure has been marked by a swift shift toward what he believes are the military's primary responsibilities, with a focus on reversing what he perceives as distractions from operational effectiveness. His actions thus far suggest a significant cultural and policy shift within the Department of Defense, drawing scrutiny from both supporters and critics.
Military Personnel EOs
President Donald Trump signed two major executive orders that significantly altered military personnel policies. These orders addressed two very different issues, sparking both praise and criticism. One order reinstated service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, while the other banned transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military.
The first executive order, announced by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, reinstated approximately 8,000 military members to their previous ranks, with full back pay and benefits. Hegseth described the vaccine mandate as "unfair" and "unnecessary," framing the order as a move to correct what many saw as an injustice. Those affected included thousands of soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen who had been discharged for vaccine refusal.
In contrast, the second executive order banned transgender individuals from serving in the military, overturning a policy enacted during the Biden administration. The Trump administration argued that the ban was essential to maintaining military readiness, although the decision was met with immediate legal challenges. Advocacy groups argued that the ban violated constitutional rights, triggering intense debate over its fairness.
This juxtaposition of reinstating personnel refusing the vaccine while banning transgender service members illustrates the Trump administration's broader approach to military policy. The reinstatement was framed as rectifying an injustice, while the ban was seen as a necessary step for military effectiveness.
Both orders reflect the administration's intent to reshape the military in line with its views on readiness, personnel management, and social policy. As these changes unfold, the Fleet Reserve Association will monitor their impact on service members and military operations.
Firing of U.S. Coast Guard Commandant
On January 21, 2025, Admiral Linda Fagan, the first woman to lead a U.S. military branch, was dismissed as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard by the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security cited "leadership deficiencies" and "operational failures," specifically mentioning concerns over her handling of border security, including fentanyl interdiction efforts.
Although Fagan recently achieved recruitment successes, the administration criticized her earlier shortfalls and a perceived excessive focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies, arguing that these detracted from the Coast Guard's primary mission. Her management of Operation Fouled Anchor, an investigation into historical sexual misconduct at the Coast Guard Academy, also factored into her removal.
Admiral Linda Fagan was replaced by Admiral Kevin Lunday as the acting U.S. Coast Guard Commandant. Lunday had previously served as the vice commandant under Fagan.
Final Push: 2025 Legislative Survey
As a final push for the 2025 FRA legislative survey, members are encouraged to participate and share the survey with friends and family in the military community. The feedback is vital for shaping future legislative priorities and ensuring the FRA continues to advocate for the interests of active and retired service members.
