U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (AL-03), Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, released a statement on President Trump's Executive Orders to restore the focus of the military on lethality by gutting the DEI bureaucracy, ending far-left gender ideology, and reinstating servicemembers who were discharged due to their refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine.
"President Trump has made it clear: our military will be focused on protecting our nation. No longer will our military waste time implementing the far left woke policies of the Biden administration. Our warfighters will be focused on lethality, capability, and readiness."
