Highlight: Donald Trump's administration issued an executive order mandating an end to government-funded DEI efforts.
Body


The Social Security Administration has announced that it is terminating a research program that focuses on retirement and disability policies.
Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek made the announcement in a press release saying that it is an action that supports President 's executive order "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing."
Newsweek has contacted the Social Security Administration, via email, for comment.
Why It Matters
When Trump took office, he signed an  mandating an end to government-funded DEI efforts and directing that DEI-related roles be phased out. The administration has also exerted pressure on  to similarly shift their focus away from DEI initiatives.
This is the latest example of a federal department falling into line with Trump's executive order.
What To Know
The Social Security Administration previously entered into cooperative agreements with the Retirement and Disability Research Consortium (RDRC)—a program for research on social security, retirement and disability policy issues.
This has involved the University of Michigan, Boston College, the National Bureau of Economic Research, City University of New York Baruch College, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Terminating these agreements is expected to result "in about $15 million in cost savings for hardworking Americans in fiscal year 2025," the Social Security Administration said.
What People Are Saying
Social Security's Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said: "Terminating our RDRC cooperative agreements aligns with President Trump's priorities to end fraudulent and wasteful initiatives and contracts."
In a previous press release he said: "Good government means finding ways to do better: The Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, is a critical part of President Trump's commitment to identifying fraud, waste, and abuse, and better ways for the government to function to support its people."
What Happens Next
While the American taxpayer is set to save around $15 million, it remains to be seen what impact the loss of these agreements will have on Social Security.
Judge Blocks Some Of Trump's DEI Executive Orders
The news comes as Baltimore U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson, who was nominated by Democratic President , granted a preliminary injunction, blocking Trump's administration from terminating or changing contracts considered equity-related.
Abelson found that the orders may be unconstitutional and could violate free speech rights, according to the Associated Press, after plaintiffs including the city of Baltimore and higher education groups sued Trump earlier this month.
Attorney Aleshadye Getachew said during a hearing on Wednesday: "What's happening is an overcorrection and pulling back on DEI statements."
