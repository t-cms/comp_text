Acting Chairman Feldman Ends DEI at CPSC
Earlier this week, President Trump issued Executive Orders entitled Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing and Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions. Pursuant to these orders, I am taking several actions to terminate all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and activities at the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
As of today, all DEI offices at CPSC have been terminated, and all DEI-related contracts have been cancelled. Additionally, I have directed the termination of CPSC's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility Council, including its establishing directive and associated charter.
To address the elimination of DEI from Commission-approved documents that require a Commission vote and are outside of my authority as Acting Chairman, I have directed staff to prepare a ballot for Commission consideration to remove or rescind DEI-related items in CPSC's existing Operating Plan, Strategic Plan, and Performance Budget Request to Congress. This includes any priority activities, milestones, operating performance measures, and strategic goals.
Going forward, this agency will focus exclusively on the safety of American families and our core mission: to protect the public against unreasonable risk of injury associated with consumer products.
