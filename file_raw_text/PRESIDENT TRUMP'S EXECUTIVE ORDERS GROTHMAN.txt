The following information was released by the office of Wisconsin Rep. Glenn Grothman:
Since being sworn into office on Monday, President Trump has signed numerous executive orders aimed at getting our country back on track. These actions mark the beginning of a much-needed change in Washington, D.C., and the federal government.
Four key executive orders that I want to highlight are:
Securing the Border
Ending Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Policies
Overturning the Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate
Withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO)
First, President Trump's executive order to secure the border will prioritize completing the border wall system, enforcing immigration laws, and reinstating the "Remain in Mexico" policy, which requires asylum seekers to wait outside the United States while their cases are processed. These measures aim to reduce illegal immigration, combat cartel activity, and protect both American citizens and migrants from dangerous conditions at the border. This decisive action reaffirms the Trump administration's commitment to border security and the rule of law.
Second, I applaud President Trump for swiftly moving to end divisive DEI policies within the federal government. DEI often excludes individuals based on factors unrelated to their character or qualifications. By restoring a merit-based system, this executive order promotes a fair and level playing field in government operations and hiring practices.
Third, President Trump's executive order to overturn the EV Mandate is a step toward protecting consumer choice and affordability. EVs are far more expensive than gas-powered cars, and the mandate unfairly forced consumers toward options they may not want or be able to afford. By rescinding this policy, President Trump is defending Americans' ability to choose the vehicles that work for them while emphasizing the importance of market-based solutions over politically motivated regulations.
Finally, President Trump's decision to withdraw from the WHO is a step toward ensuring that American interests are prioritized on the global stage. The WHO has repeatedly failed to act in the best interests of the United States and its allies, and pausing funding sends a strong message about accountability and reform in international organizations.
