Donald Trump has confirmed that he had a highly productive call with Vladimir Putin this morning after initial news the two leaders had spoken was first reported by CNN.
The president gave a lengthy synopsis of their call on Truth Social, saying that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine will begin immediately and even teased that they may visit each other's respective countries. 
I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects. We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering, that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many! We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together. 
But first, as we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, "COMMON SENSE." We both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other's Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now.
I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful. Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost!
I want to thank President Putin for his time and effort with respect to this call, and for the release, yesterday, of Marc Fogel, a wonderful man that I personally greeted last night at the White House. I believe this effort will lead to a successful conclusion, hopefully soon!

Egyptian President Sisi and King Abdullah II of Jordan stated that Gaza should be rebuilt without displacing Palestinians, according to a statement from Egypt's presidency reporting on a phone call between the two leaders.
Yesterday, while meeting with President Donald Trump, the Jordanian king called this the "unified Arab position," which other Arab leaders in the region echoed.
President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates told Secretary of State Marco Rubio today that peace efforts in the region should be on the basis of a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
Trump has called for the permanent displacement of Gaza's 2 million Palestinians and for the territory to be redeveloped as the "Riviera of the Middle East."

Cybercrime boss to be released in exchange for U.S. teacher Mac Fogel

A U.S. official has revealed that the U.S. is releasing a Russian cybercrime boss from prison in exchange for Moscow's release of schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who arrived back in Washington, D.C. last night after almost three years of detention in Russia.
The Kremlin said the deal - the first it has made with President Donald Trump's new administration - could help build trust between the two countries.
However, Russia played down Trump's suggestion that the agreement could significantly contribute to ending the Russia-Ukraine war, which he has pledged to bring to a swift conclusion.
Alexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017 and extradited eventually to the U.S., where he pleaded guilty in May 2024 to conspiracy to commit money laundering.
He operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he was suspected of funneling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings, and other criminal activity.
A U.S. administration official confirmed to Reuters that he was being released, but did not elaborate on the details or timing. Earlier, the Kremlin said a Russian was being freed but that it would not name him until he was back in the country.

most aggressive (by a long margin) any foreign leader has been with trump since inauguration. opposite of what trump was expecting in press conference with jordan king...
- ian bremmer (@ianbremmer)

Trump has infuriated the Arab world with a plan to permanently displace over 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, assert U.S. control over the area, and develop it into the "Riviera of the Middle East."
He has demanded that Egypt and Jordan accept the Palestinians, threatening to withdraw aid from the two U.S.-allied Arab states if they refuse. Egypt, alongside Israel, is one of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid. 
Yesterday, Jordan's King Abdullah II appeared uncomfortable during his meeting with Trump at the White House during which the president discussed his Gaza plan.
Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty visited Washington this week to avert a potentially awkward presidential visit. However, according to Egyptian sources, Secretary of State Marco Rubio made it apparent that the Palestinian displacement plan would be discussed if Sisi visited.
Abdelatty responded that such a meeting would be of no use and that any discussion should be over Egypt's own plan for reconstruction of Gaza, the sources said, which ensures Palestinians remain on their land.
King Abdullah raised the prospect of the Egyptian plan during a brief press conference with Trump on Tuesday.
Sisi has repeatedly stated that Egypt would never facilitate the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, viewing it as a significant threat to Egypt's own security. Such actions could breed extremism and provide a pretext for future Israeli attacks, in addition to being an injustice to the Palestinians.
Powell heads back to Capitol Hill as progress on inflation stalls
14:56
,
Oliver O'Connell
As data shows U.S. consumer prices rose faster than expected in January, indicating that progress on inflation may still be stalled, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is heading to Congress for a second day of testimony.
Rising prices for housing, food, and energy pushed the Consumer Price Index up at a 3% annual rate in January, compared to 2.9% in the previous month.
The change in the Consumer Price Index slightly exceeded analysts' expectations. This is likely to increase the Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates further, as policymakers wait for signs that price pressures in the economy will continue to ease.
The jump in consumer staples, with gas prices rising 1.8% over the month and food at home increasing by half a percentage point, could also influence public expectations about inflation, which the Fed believes are crucial to manage.
Powell will appear today before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. ET and will typically repeat the opening statement delivered in Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump offered his sage take on Truth Social: "Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets [sic] Rock and Roll, America!!!"
He later added: "BIDEN INFLATION UP!"

Trump's steel and aluminum imports likely to drive up car costs, industry leaders say

Joe Sommerlad
The president's tariffs on steel imports this week could wreak havoc on American auto manufacturing, industry leaders say. 
The moves align with the Trump administration's aggressive global trade agenda and ambitions to strengthen U.S. industry but they could have an inverse effect.
On March 12, all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25 percent, the result of two orders the president signed on Monday that also include a 25 percent tariff on aluminum. 
That could have a serious impact on domestic auto companies including Ford, GM and Stellantis - and make these companies' vehicles more expensive for the nation's car buyers.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was unrealistic and the Trump administration does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution to the war triggered by Russia's invasion.

He also told Washington's NATO allies that they would have to step up and assume greater responsibility for Europe's security.

Trump administration appeals Maryland judge's ruling blocking birthright citizenship order
13:30
The president's administration has said it's appealing a federal judge's ruling blocking Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for people whose parents are not legally in the country.
In a brief filing, the administration's attorneys said they were appealing to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. It's the second such appeal the administration has sought since Trump's executive order was blocked in court.
The government's appeal stems from U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman's grant of a preliminary injunction last week in a case brought by immigrant rights groups and expectant mothers in Maryland. 
Boardman said at the time her court would not become the first in the country to endorse the president's order, calling citizenship a "precious right" granted by the Constitution's 14th Amendment.
Tuesday's appeal is the latest volley over the president's birthright citizenship order, which has generated at least nine lawsuits nationwide, including suits brought by 22 states.

Trump's Defense Secretary was booed and heckled on his first trip abroad yesterday by military families protesting his actions against Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Hegseth faced the protesters as he arrived at the U.S. European Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.
Around two dozen people who live at the U.S. military's top European headquarters turned up, seemingly in protest at the Trump administration's policy of dismantling DEI initiatives.
The protesters chanted "DEI" in an apparent reference to a ban enacted by Hegseth on some books in defense department schools. 
Last week, the secretary ordered the restriction of education materials, including materials covering psychology and immigration.
Similarly, Hegseth said in a memo last week that transgender people would not be allowed to join the military and that the armed forces would stop facilitating gender transition procedures for service members.

Joe Sommerlad
The president continued pressing his plan for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip and displace the 2.1 million Palestinians living there into neighboring countries yesterday as he met with the leader of one of America's closest Middle East allies, King Abdullah II of Jordan.
As the two leaders met in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters that the U.S. would not endeavor to purchase Gaza, despite statements made in the last few days in which he'd suggested that some sort of monetary transaction would allow for America to lay claim to the war-torn territory.
"We're going to have Gaza. We don't have to buy. There's nothing to buy. We will have Gaza," he said when asked about his prior statement about purchasing the long-occupied piece of land.
"We're going to take it, we're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East. It's going to be for the people in the Middle East."
Trump, who has repeatedly suggested that neighboring countries such as Jordan and Egypt could absorb Gaza's population - something both governments have rejected - said the Palestinians living there would be happy to leave because they are currently "living a terrible life" after more than a year of war following the October 7 terror attacks on Israel by Hamas.

Donald Trump has given the world's wealthiest man even more power to reshape the federal government by signing an executive order requiring agencies to cooperate with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the effort to slash costs.
Trump signed the order as Musk stood over his shoulder in the Oval Office on Tuesday as reporters - and Musk's young son - looked on. The president quickly turned over control of the question-and-answer session to his wealthy patron.
Asked about critics who've called his anti-government efforts a "hostile takeover" of the executive branch, Musk told reporters: "The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get."
He claimed that the purpose of Trump's administration was to "restore democracy" by eliminating the independence of the professionalized civil service, which he described as "this unelected fourth, unconstitutional branch of government, which is the bureaucracy."
Musk also suggested that executive branch agencies have "in a lot of ways, currently, more power than any elected representative" and claimed - without offering any evidence - that federal employees were illegally enriching themselves to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and said his effort is also targeting alleged fraud in federal spending.

Jeffrey Epstein 'client list' to be declassified by Trump administration

Joe Sommerlad
Good morning!
The "client list" belonging to the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is set to be released by a new Trump administration task force charged with the declassification of federal secrets, according to The Times.
Florida Republican Representative Anna Paulina Luna, who is leading the task force, announced on Tuesday that the latest batch of declassified files would include dossiers relating to the 9/11 terror attacks, the origins of Covid-19, the assassination of John F Kennedy, UFOs and the contact list belonging to the disgraced financier, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019.
