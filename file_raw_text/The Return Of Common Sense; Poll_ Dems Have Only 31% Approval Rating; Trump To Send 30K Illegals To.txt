SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Anyway, that's all the time we have left this evening. Thank you for being with us. Thank you for making the show possible. Please set your DVR so you never ever, ever, ever miss an episode of Hannity.
News anytime, every time, all the time, Foxnews.com, Hannity.com.
In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Greg Gutfeld will put a smile on your face next. Have a great night.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Oh, stop. You're so needy. Good evening, everyone.
So Vogue Magazine criticized Melania Trump's 2025 White House portrait, comparing her to a freelance magician. Well, it is true. She sure made Jill disappear.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: President Trump said he will send 30,000 illegals to Guantanamo Bay. They'll be coming from Philly, New York, and San Fran, so consider it an upgrade.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Meanwhile, in an interview, border czar Tom Homan called Joy Reid dumber than a box of rocks.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: The American Geological Society has demanded an apology.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Speaking of rocks, scientists have discovered an asteroid that has a 1 percent chance of hitting earth, but it has a 99 percent chance of hitting JB Pritzker because he's really fat.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I mean, seriously, look it up. Kamala Harris remains the front runner for the 2028 nomination. I know, that's some accolade.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That's like being first in line at a James Carville kissing booth.
(LAUGHTER)
GEORGE 'TYRUS' MURDOCH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'd rather be first than last.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That is disgusting.
MURDOCH: Yeah.
GUTFELD: It's disgusting. Disgraced ex-New Jersey senator Bob Menendez was sentenced to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes. He appeared to be really excited about the sentence, but it was just a gold bar in his pants.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Since the pandemic, American students have fallen further behind in reading skills. On the bright side, though, being illiterate is not an obstacle to success.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But also, only 1 third of New York City 4th graders were deemed proficient in math, which is great for me. I can now charge twice as much when I buy them beer.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: 15 percent of women in federal prison are actually men claiming to be transgender, that's according to the New York Times and that weekend I spent at San Quentin.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Scientists are using scientists are using genetic engineering to create mice with 2 male parents. It's all part of a bigger plan to create mice who love musicals.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: And on "The View," Joy Behar claims the new White House press secretary got her job because she's a 10. Meanwhile, Joy is on The View because she's a ton.
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: But Joy is right, Karoline Leavitt is a 10. But also 10, the amount of beers it takes for a homeless guy to have sex with Joy Behar.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Not homeless takes a 100. All right. So right now, the Democratic Party is finding itself in a very uncomfortable spot, and no, I don't mean in a men's room stall next to a very lactose intolerant Bernie Sanders.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Now the Dems are screwed because the Republicans have pulled the high ground maneuver by becoming the party of common sense, which means anything that might challenge that has to be the opposite as in (BEEP) crazy. Because parties are about differentiation and how do you differentiate from sane.
See, by staking out the common sense middle, i.e. public safety and actual border, cutting a bloated federal budget, the Republicans have put the dams in the crazy corner. They're stuck. Now at odds with basic truths Americans desire. It was always the case, but now it's really transparent. And if any Democrat tries to deal the common sense card himself, like, say, Fetterman, then you now look a whole lot like a Republican.
Although most Republicans, they wear pants.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So if you're the Dems, where do you go? The majority of Americans, they're ready to tell them. The latest poll has the Dems at 31 percent approval. Can you imagine anyone being that unpopular?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I mean, we could do that too, Joy. Right? You know who else wore white? Hitler. But at no time in recent history has the Democratic Party been more reviled, and they once ran this for president. So the Dems are stuck with the high ground now so far out of reach, they need to find out what's left for them because their entire worldview has been rejected like me at an ugly person's conference.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: And that's because the general public gets common sense. In fact, you could hate Republicans and still say, you know, I like what they're doing with immigration and crime and trans. It's just common sense. It's why so many new demographics have shifted right. The right gained ground with every voting block because common sense made sense. As a result, the Dems now have no way to dissent without being against common sense.
Take the illegal raids. Sure, some lefties scream racism, but the public hears, wait, they're deporting violent migrant criminals? I'm for that, and I'm Mexican.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: True. Now many people of color actually live in these neighborhoods. I know because I go there to teach at risk youth CPR.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: And what about trans? Well, would you want your daughter playing junior high basketball against a dude who's taller, stronger, and heavier by 30 pounds? Do you think children who can't spell transgender should be having their bodies permanently altered like they're a suit off the rack at Men's Wearhouse?
Meanwhile, the odds of genuine gender dysphoria actually happening naturally are about the same as Nancy Pelosi's face.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: It has to be created. The common sense answer supported by most Americans leaves the left with nowhere to go. On crime, same thing. Whatever your party affiliation, common sense means you want your loved ones coming home at night in the same shape they left in, even if it is the shape of a beanbag chair.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Is there anything sadder than watching liberal mayors and governors trying to defend murderers, rapists, and child traffickers? It's crazy. And what can the lay the left say when only 6 percent of DC workers actually go to work? Besides, get your lazy ass into the office --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: -- especially when thousands of government buildings sit empty like a meeting of the Jim Acosta fan club.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Is there any way to oppose that and not sound like a nut and risk being hired by MSNBC? The truth is the woke world took over the Democratic Party, and so common sense was there for the taking and Trump took it. And now the Dems are on the outside looking in like Joe Biden at a mausoleum.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: See, the Dems can't be the other party of common sense. That lane is occupied. And it all happened because the Dems were in a competition to out woke each other, allowing Trump to make it safe for common sense again, which means the left is left with defending things that are obviously bad for the country, which now includes the party.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Let's welcome, tonight's guests.
(ANNOUNCER: PERIOD!)
GUTFELD: He's so rich, the pool on his boat has a boat. Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: He's got lots of voices in his head and zero choices in his bed. Comedian Tyler Fischer.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: She'll criticize the Fed's actions in between her contractions. New York Times bestselling author --
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: And doctors use a wrecking ball to test his reflexes. New York Times bestselling author, comedian and former NWA World Champion, Tyrus.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: So, Kevin, this is an interesting, I don't know, outcome of this election. So a successful company in a even a modestly crowded marketplace has to have a point of difference. It has to differentiate itself. So how can this company, the Democrats, do that when they have to differentiate themselves from something as broad and meaningful as common sense? What do they do?
KEVIN O'LEARY, "SHARK TANK" STAR: It was a brutal outcome. I always thought that evening, which I thought was amazing. I was watching this stuff happen with everybody else. And I thought, you know, when America gets really screwed up and it's just makes no sense to anybody, it fixes itself like that.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
O'LEARY: And that's exactly what happens.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)-++++----
O'LEARY: Maybe you like Trump, maybe you don't, but here we are. We're fixed.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
O'LEARY: And then for those guys, they're screwed.
GUTFELD: But what if -- I mean, you know, Trump won, and -- were you confident he would win? Because what if Kamala had won, none of this would be happening.
O'LEARY: I was worried about the tax rate, frankly.
(LAUGHTER)
O'LEARY: That was the problem for me. I was thinking, am I going to go home tomorrow morning up 40 percent in taxes? That would be bad.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
O'LEARY: So I was hanging out right till 2 in the morning saying this is good.
GUTFELD: You truly are a man of the people.
O'LEARY: I think so.
GUTFELD: Yes. Yes. Good for you. Tyler, you don't even know what a tax rate is. You have to make money for that. We'll explain it later.
(LAUGHTER)
MURDOCH: Wow.
GUTFELD: All right. I'm joking. I love the fact that you shaved and cut your hair. Now you look like a leprechaun with a job.
(LAUGHTER)
MURDOCH: Oh. Yeah. Workout [ph] battle. Go.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But, by the way, do you think the Democrats can actually find a lane? I don't see how it's possible.
TYLER FISCHER, COMEDIAN: No. It's not possible. I'm sorry. I'm looking at Kevin's 2 watches. I feel like such a loser.
(LAUGHTER)
O'LEARY: Don't I look spectacular?
FISCHER: Man, don't tell me you're also wearing underwear.
(LAUGHTER)
FISCHER: This guy. No. They just keep -- you're licking their own wounds like you said. It's like when your dog rolls in its own poop. And then keeps watching Joy Reid. You know?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yeah.
FISCHER: But it's, you know, it's the DEI stuff. I love Trump's getting rid of it. Right? DEI. Right? Spell it. I call it die. Right? It's going to right? It's doing a great impression of Biden. It's going to die so quick now.
(LAUGHTER)
FISCHER: But everything's racist. Right? You can say, sir, I'm having a cupcake. And they'll say, sir, cupcakes are racist. Because black people, they don't have cups or cakes. And I said, what are you talking about?
(LAUGHTER)
FISCHER: You know, it's going to be gone so quick. And Kevin's going to invest 30 trillion. Let's do it on air. Let's negotiate on air. Into my career.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
FISCHER: 30 trillion. You watch it. You watch out for that.
GUTFELD: Do watch it. So, Kat, I have a, I have an alternate theory, which I think is likely to happen.
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: OK.
GUTFELD: The Dems are going to just wait 3 years, and then they're going to do this return to sanity in which they say that Trump has gone too far. Because that's the only thing they're going to be able to do is, look, Trump went too far in immigration. He went too far against crime. He went - - that's the only thing they're going to come up with, and it'll probably be Mayor Pete.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: I think it's really difficult to do that because I think what they've already done is -- I think where they went wrong was when they started talking about all the things you had to not do to make sure you weren't normalizing Trump.
GUTFELD: Right.
TIMPF: So it wasn't enough to agree with them on some stuff. It wasn't enough to agree with them even on most stuff. It wasn't enough to agree with them on literally everything. But then if you have a friend in your life who voted for Trump that you're still talking to, you're normalizing Trump.
And then -- it's we all have been there where we have maybe someone in our lives where, like, you have to behave your best at their house to keep getting invited to their parties. And you're like, oh, I better be careful. I better -- what do I wear? What do I do? If I -- and then all when you stop just being like -- are they even that fun?
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: Are they really even that fun when I can't do anything? And I have to pretend to be a different person. I think that they people that they went too far with that. I think there has to be some acknowledgment of that. I don't think they could just turn around and say Trump went too far because people are kind of tired of listening to them their opinions of Trump when you were told you can't even you norm a lot. What is -- what it'd be you lost all meaning at a point.
GUTFELD: Yeah. And, once they found out, Tyrus, that America prefers Trump, all of that stuff has gone away, and they didn't, like, have a backup plan. Would you give them advice?
MURDOCH: No.
(LAUGHTER)
MURDOCH: That's it. No. No. Listen --
GUTFELD: You can go down there.
MURDOCH: -- they have to cut their king's head off. And what I mean by that is, they've had many forms politicians. For a while, they were evangelists, everything was the lord and family.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MURDOCH: And then there was the lawyer. There was the savvy lawyer that was going to fight for your rights and stuff. And then they evolved the activist. And that's what we've had for the last 3 and -- is activists. The thing about activists is all they know how to do is complain. They can't solve (BEEP) because they're activists.
So then when they're given problems, they're like, no, no, no. I only know how to complain about this. So what I'm going to do is every time you hit me with a responsibility, I'm going to give you a new complaint. So there's so much stuff going on. You're racist, misogynistic, this, that, whatever. There was so much stuff the Americans like, I can't juggle all the things that are wrong with me and still feed my family.
What's the other side talking about? The Republicans, they -- at one time, you couldn't stand Republicans because everything was, god, this, family, this, this, this. If you if you made a mistake in your life, you were done forever. You had to wear an 8 piece suit to lunch. But there was no -- we had we had and you had to evolve to the point where now you can have your hat on backwards and wear one sweat leg up because you just (BEEP) feel like it.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
MURDOCH: So -- but it's an evolution. The Democrats have to kill the activists, because it doesn't work. America rejected it soundly because you have to actually know the job. The biggest problem, the biggest turn off with the 10 is that she didn't show up with a 12 page notebook.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MURDOCH: She could actually answer questions, cite laws, and come off intelligent and good for the job and are opposed to the other side where the only thing we know for sure is that the sister let us know that she was the first of 3 categories.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MURDOCH: And the rest of it was nothing else was explained. The biggest notebook in the world with no answers in it.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: All right. Up next, illegal set sail for a famous Cuban jail.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(ANNOUNCER: A STORY IN 5 WORDS)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Trump sends illegals to Gitmo. Tyler, president Trump plans to use Guantanamo Bay, which is also known as Gitmo for those at home. They've -- to detain up to 30,000 illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, and he signed a memorandum directing the Pentagon and DHS to expand and update the facilities. Is this a good idea or is it a great idea?
FISCHER: Gitmo. Gitmo. Gitmo the hell out of here. How about that?
(LAUGHTER)
FISCHER: And I got one. I got the leg up for -- in solidarity with Tyrus. This is my, like, taken knee. Right? This is my no. I love it. And I think, honestly, if Dr. Fauci wasn't pardoned for crimes he committed back in 2014, he would be sent there with these criminal I think that'd be the best punishment to watch --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
FISCHER: -- Dr. Fauci tried to administer CDC guidelines in jail. You know, fellas, let's keep the gang bang down to 8 people. It's a real super spreader event. Make sure you put a mask on your penis before you -- you know where this is going. And I'm going to censor myself before this is all it's all going to get cut out. Right? I'll leave that in. But that's how I feel about Dr. Fauci.
GUTFELD: Yes. And very strongly. Here's -- Kat, here's Trump just basically talking in general terms to the countries that are going to accept illegals.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For the first time in history, we're loading dangerous and illegal aliens into military aircraft and flying them back to the places from which they came. You probably read about Colombia 2 days ago. They said, no. We're not taking them. I said, we're going to take them. You're going to take them. You're going to like it too. You're going to take them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: And that might be the first time a president has ever said, and you're going to like it too.
(LAUGHTER)
MURDOCH: Don't think that's true.
TIMPF: Yeah.
GUTFELD: I didn't do any research on it, but I'm pretty certain --
TIMPF: Definitely, definitely not true.
O'LEARY: I'm pretty sure Kennedy --
GUTFELD: Yeah. But Kennedy was saying it to his secretary.
TIMPF: Yeah. No. No.
O'LEARY: He was in the swimming pool. He's in the swimming pool.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
MURDOCH: What? Too soon?
TIMPF: Yeah.
FISCHER: Ask not if you'll like this too.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: I guess this is one of those things where it's like, I have a hard time, really hard time, like, getting my heartstrings going for violent criminals. And I --
FISCHER: (CROSSTALK) Selena Gomez's pound you're talking about.
TIMPF: But the thing is I'm -- you know, I do differ from some Republicans on immigration. I don't see any need to spend money deporting people who are contributing to our economy, for example, that's one of the ways I differ.
But when you talk about violence, criminals, I don't see the controversy of or even the anger and the need to get them out of here. And also people who aren't contributing to the economy, we only have so -- I mean, the amount that we pay in taxes, it's like, we have this incentive to have all these people come here. These things make sense to me.
I don't know -- like, the guan -- can you do that?
GUTFELD: Trump just says --
TIMPF: He just says, what if we, though? You know? It's like, what if we?
GUTFELD: And then they do it.
TIMPF: Yeah. I don't know what the -- I don't know I don't know what the legality of it. But, yeah, I don't understand the aim of attempting to go on people's heartstrings over violent criminals.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: I don't see how that's controversial.
O'LEARY: What a second, did you see the seats in those airplanes? Talk about discount economy.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
O'LEARY: Unbelievable. They walk in there. They're really crappy seats. I'm wondering, do they get a box lunch or what's the deal? Like, that's a long trip down there in a really crappy seat. I think they're really going to ask for better service next time.
GUTFELD: Maybe so.
(CROSSTALK)
FISCHER: You gave them (CROSSTALK) SkyMiles -- deportation.
GUTFELD: Tyrus, what about Gitmo?
MURDOCH: It should have been open mode. I mean, it should have been used in the first place. And I think it's -- the one thing that he said that I think is really important, he said, some of the criminals are so bad that we cannot trust the other countries not to just let them back out. So we're just going to hold on to them. So your mass murderers and your mass rapists who were should be in prison for the rest of their natural born lives, whether it's in Gitmo or Havana, doesn't matter as long as they're not hurting anyone anywhere.
I think that that's important. I think that's good. And to your point, Trump will say -- President Trump will be like, hey, what about this? And then, like, 7 or 8 guys, are like, yeah, that roll with that. That sounds good. And then there's a little guy in the back that no one really talks to. Can we do that legally? And he's like, yeah. We did.
(LAUGHTER)
MURDOCH: So then they're like, let's do it. All right. Diet Coke for everybody. What's next?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You know? Oh, Elon's doing pull ups. I mean, it's just a fun. This is what happens when people are trying to solve problems come together and you listen to other people. When you have a president, that when you have an idea, it doesn't go -- you know, and then ushered out of a building.
This is what we're seeing. This is this is crazy. Someone had an idea. He heard it. Sounded good. Legally makes sense [ph]. Hey. Maybe this now will have less in our hotels.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
MURDOCH: You know? And everyone who took --
FISCHER: How many have (CROSSTALK) girlfriend --
MURDOCH: I'm not saying it. But Kat had brought up earlier an interesting argument where she talked about pulling the heartstrings. Sanctuary cities have no one to blame but themselves.
GUTFELD: Right.
MURDOCH: You want to be like, no. We're going to hide them all. And then just like any other parent, when your child -- when you tell your -- give me the green crayon, little Greg. No, I don't want to. Fine, I'm taking them all. Yeah. And so now all of your little are all going to be pulled out of your sanctuary cities because you want to hide the bad ones to stand up for your virtue signaling. So now you'll have none.
GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, Kevin --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: -- real quick. There's something about this CEO move. Everything is so fast. Is this is this a common strategy of effective leaders? Like, these things are just happening one after the other after the other.
O'LEARY: I don't think Trump gives a (BEEP). He just keeps --
(LAUGHTER)
O'LEARY: I just think he's going to keep going till somebody says no.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
O'LEARY: I mean, I've just --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: It is crazy. It's crazy. All right. We got to move on.
Up next. Her rehab is starting because of her farting.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A story in five words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Woman punished for cyber farts.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Kat, I'm coming to you first.
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: I knew it, yes.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So a 25-year-old British women -- I already don't like her - name Rhiannon Evans, pled guilty to sending videos of herself smirking and farting. She sent these videos to her boyfriend's ex to make her uncomfortable. Of course, she might have been inebriated at the time. So as a libertarian, I mean, this is another country, it seems England is now censoring flatulence.
TIMPF: Yes. So are her and her boyfriend still together? That's what I want to know. I am on her side, obviously. I feel like what she did was disgusting, but also like so funny.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: And I feel like the woman, the ex on the receiving end, do you know the story that you just got for brunch to share? My boyfriend's new girlfriend, look what she sent me, and you're going to sue her over it? I don't know. I feel like the law got this one wrong, in my opinion.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: In the court of a me, this was hilarious.
KEVIN O'LEARY, O'LEARY VENTURES CHAIRMAN: are digital farts tokens? Can you make money on them?
GUTFELD: Yes, NFT, wouldn't it be called an NFT, a national fart token?
O'LEARY: What is the market in digital farting?
GUTFELD: That is true. Could you buy a digital fart from a celebrity?
O'LEARY: Yes.
GUTFELD: Would you sell one of your farts?
O'LEARY: That would be a premium.
(LAUGHTER)
O'LEARY: And it would come, my fart would come with a royalty.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TYRUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: And you could subscribe.
GUTFELD: You'd have to subscribe to farts. But they generally, just go away so you would pay for the ongoing fart.
TYRUS: Yes.
O'LEARY: This is fantastic.
GUTFELD: All right, how about this, how about this, how about this, Kevin, Shark Tank, we come on and sell it fart NFTs.
O'LEARY: And made the best fart win. I think there's something there.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TYLER FISCHER, COMEDIAN: And we call it "Shart Tank."
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
O'LEARY: I like "Shark Fart." GUTFELD: "Shart Tank", it's a little messy. It's a little messy. Has a girlfriend, have you ever had a girlfriend --
TYRUS: I thought I already did my talking part in this. I'm pretty sure I went before Kat.
GUTFELD: Nobody wants to talk about this?
TIMPF: Really?
TYRUS: You know my problem with this is because it just shows how brutal people have become. Just so sensitive. Like really? She didn't knock on your door, pull your hair off, or wait for you in the parking lot. She sent something that you can use against her many months later.
TIMPF: Exactly.
O'LEARY: What law is this anyway?
TIMPF: Yes. It's in their constitution?
TYRUS: But it's not just there. Somebody the size of a small brontosaurus tried to get in a little tiny car and it was the guy who drove the car's fault. Not you and the twinkies. It's just so brittle. If I don't fit in something, I don't go, well, this is ridiculous. This JCPenney will hear from my lawyer? No, I have to go to DXL because I am a big -- guy. You know what I'm saying?
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: I can't sue the places where you guys go, if I went to Babies R Us and sued them. It's like ridiculous.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: But it's just so brutal. She could literally post this on her TikTok and get paid, and be like what else you got? What else you got? I just don't understand, did she cry in court? You also could have not answered her and blocked her. I don't understand.
GUTFELD: She got a restraining order, Tyler, and she has to do 15 rehab sessions, 60 days of alcohol abstinence monitoring.
O'LEARY: That's the hard part.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes. But you know what's weird, she stops drinking and her gas goes away.
FISCHER: Yes, 30 days off beans. It's really, what bothers me is how fancy the British sound. I watched the news story and I didn't laugh, because, she is just passing a bit of a wicked winter. A little bit of a poopy-pie, a smelly grenade. Only Jordan Peterson can make that fart -- you know, farts are just releasing of the patriarchal unnecessary deadwood, and you just fart out and rescue your father from the bounty of the. No, it's like really. So I don't like intellectual people. They make me look stupid. Let me check my --
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I don't know, man.
O'LEARY: Are you missing a watch?
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: How happy would you be if somebody from your past, you looked at your phone and it was a video of them farting?
FISCHER: I would love it.
TIMPF: I would be like, this is the best day of my life.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I would brag about it.
OK, coming up, daytime swine hates on Karoline.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our view on "The View."
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE) GUTFELD: "The View" gets upset when hot chicks are a threat. Everyone's favorite daytime hags went off on the sweet, adorable, and most importantly, competent Karoline Leavitt, the new White House press secretary. Here is Whoopi Goldberg attempting to school Karoline on wokeness.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, "THE FIVE": I would like this young lady, who this is her first job, I would like to do a little homework, because she said something yesterday that really pissed me off. And that was, she said there will be no wokeness here. Let me explain something to you, because without that wokeness you might not have that job.
(APPLAUSE)
GOLDBERG: Because -- because women were not invited to that table. Women were not invited to many tables in this nation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Oh, really, Whoopi? You and your cohosts were most certainly invited to many tables.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Dinner tables, lunch tables, breakfast tables.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But not to be outdone, Joy, of all people, attacked Leavitt's looks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": She has probably been put in there because, according to Donald Trump, she's a 10. You know that's what it is.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: But Joy, can she sincerely claim that no one ever hired her based on looks? Word has it "The View" hired her to make Whoopi look thin.
Tyrus, it's funny, I don't believe that wok-ism was around when Dana Perino became press secretary.
TYRUS: Trying to throw that shade at President Trump, do your homework. He had a woman build his buildings in the 70s. This man has had a woman at the top of the helm in every possession he has ever held.
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: It's laughable. And to sit there because of that wokeness? No. If it wasn't that -- if wokeness was still there, she wouldn't be allowed because she was white and intelligent and didn't have a notebook. OK? She says the wokeness ends because --
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: And then the press went at her and she answered questions, she didn't storm off. Leave me alone, Doocy. She answered questions, she cited laws, and she even took, no, that's the president's decision, that's the president's decision. I work at the behest of the president. She looked good on her first day at the job.
So here's the deal. Listen, if you ever overwhelmed or need a day off, I'm happy to substitute in, just for the day. I'll just come in. I'll show you what woke would really look like.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: I will act the fool. Names will be called, journalists will cry.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: But you don't have to watch, you don't have to watch "The View" to see a bunch of old, angry, way past their prime fat chicks talk trash about people walking by. Just go to any Walmart checkout line and you can see the same thing.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Kevin, is it wrong to hire hot people?
O'LEARY: I think you've got to hire them on merit. And I just want to say one thing I've learned over 17 years. I am not surprised, I guess, but "Shark Tank," 17 years, hundreds of companies I have invested in -- 90 percent of my returns came from companies run by women. Now, how the hell did that happen? This idea if you want something done, give it to a busy mother because they have to juggle a lot of stuff at the same time. Remember, these are start-ups. These are high risk situations.
Look, I don't care what planet you're from, I don't care what gender you are, I don't care what color you are, if you can do the job, come and work for me so I can make some money. That's it. I really don't give a damn. I don't have any of this crap. And this idea of DEI, or whatever the hell it's called, I never heard anything about it. I just hired people who know what they are doing, and it worked out great for me. So I think we should go back to that, merit-based.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Tyler, is Joy just bitter?
FISCHER: I just want to comment. Kevin, I love what you said there, and as a Venezuelan trans-mother of six, I have a couple ideas I would like to talk to you in the green room.
(LAUGHTER)
FISCHER: They are -- and I have to say this, from being single forever, women get jealous of women. I think women where makeup for women. They all look like ducks now. It's like I am kissing a cartoon. I don't know who that is for. It's not for me.
(LAUGHTER)
O'LEARY: That duck thing, you're talking about the lip.
FISCHER: The lip filler. Every girl has got them.
O'LEARY: Enough with that.
GUTFELD: Yes, it's so weird. And I think it is plastic surgeons and women that are into that. Guys are like --
TIMPF: I think I'm going to come back from maternity leave with huge ones, actually.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: Think of all the time I will have to get things done. I've never had enough days off to get things done. I'm going to have triple D's and huge lips.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
O'LEARY: It's a look.
FISCHER: Natural. Natural.
GUTFELD: Is Tyler right, though, women can be so mean against other women?
FISCHER: And don't hit me before you say.
TIMPF: A thousand percent. I've got no interest in hitting anybody. But I also do think it is funny that, are they trying to say that a straight, white woman is a wokeness higher? Because that is not how the people who are obsessed with woke think about it. You can't just check one box. You check one box, you can go -- yourself. You are part of the problem. I didn't really understand, maybe she didn't realize that, because that is not --
GUTFELD: It's funny. It's like Whoopi is proving the adversarial point, which is that wokeness makes you suspicious of everybody. Oh, she got the job because she is a chick. That only comes into your mind because that is what DEI does to everybody. It raises the suspicion you did not get here on your own, and Whoopi just proved it. But as we know, and I've said, Dana Perino was a white female press secretary. DEI did not exist then, wokeism didn't exist then.
FISCHER: Talent did.
TIMPF: What if I have enough time to get addicted to plastic surgery, and I get a chin implant?
(LAUGHTER)
FISCHER: What is a chin implant?
TIMPF: I'm going to find out. I'll get one first and check it out later.
GUTFELD: All right. Holy toledo, Chuck, check your libido.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(SINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's coming your way, hey, hey. It's Video of the Day.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: His name is chuck, and he makes you go yuck. Chuck Schumer had an interesting way of describing the energizing effects that Trump's federal loan freeze is having on opponents. Roll it, Marge.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: People aroused. I haven't seen people so aroused in a very, very long time in terms of going, trying to get this done.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Tyler, he hasn't seen people aroused in a very long time.
(LAUGHTER)
FISCHER: He is not in this studio right now, but -- even the way, it almost sounds like this is how he touches himself, or the two guys next to him, I don't know what it is. This guy --
(LAUGHTER)
O'LEARY: No, no. This is new. It's is called boner policy.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: What is boner policy?
O'LEARY: It get your aroused. That's good politics, baby.
GUTFELD: Kat --
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: You need to work on that segway. I'm willing to prove it, Kat.
TIMPF: I know, but also the camera caught me dealing with a cramp.
FISCHER: And Chuck's re-aroused again.
TIMPF: I think the way that he -- like, good save, buddy. He's like, in terms of getting this done. Like he just realizes people might think I am talking about my penis.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: I want everyone to know that is not the case. And he thought, good save, and then he went and had lunch.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: I know I would be bothered. I get way more anxious about things that I say than that.
GUTFELD: But you know, it's funny, "aroused," it is unfair to that word to always be attached to something.
TIMPF: No, no.
TYRUS: No, no, no. Listen, they took "retard" away from us. We can certainly --
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: We should be more --
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: He told on himself. He is now -- we definitely know that there are gross old people orgies at the Senate, because he is like I haven't seen this many people aroused since --
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: -- in terms of turning it around. The last time they had a orgy, Mitch ended up going to the hospital. He was one he was in a wheelchair. Nancy broke her hip. You know what I'm saying?
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: It was all kinds of stuff going on, and he was just like, last time everyone got fired up, but we were all too -- old.
FISCHER: That's what happened to Mitch McConnell's face. Chuck took his pants off and he was --
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: I'm saying, he told on himself. No man in his right mind says I have seen people aroused, unless he is a sex trafficker or an orgy-man. So which one is it?
TIMPF: You can't possibly have thought this segment would have gone any other way.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Seriously, at what time in your life have you said, hey, fellas, I haven't seen this many people aroused a since that --
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Just tell me one time and I will let it go.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Kevin, on the "Shark Tank," does anybody ever come out and push a sex like gadget or anything? I don't think I have ever seen that.
O'LEARY: Every taping, except we never air them, because they are the best deals. Sales are spectacular. Margins are fantastic. Unfortunately, they all come from China. So the tariffs are a bitch, you know, really tough. They are all rechargeable now, too, so you don't waste batteries.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That's fantastic. That's good to know.
O'LEARY: Yes.
GUTFELD: Well, I think we're done here.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Don't go away, we'll be right back.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Out of time! Kevin O'Leary, Tyler Fischer, Timpf, Tyrus, studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
