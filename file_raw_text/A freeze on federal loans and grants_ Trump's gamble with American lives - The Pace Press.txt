A freeze on federal loans and grants: Trump's gamble with American lives

On the evening of Monday, Jan. 28, the Trump Administration put a freeze on federal loans and grants as a part of its strategy to decrease government spending. This unprecedented freeze impacts trillions of dollars set aside for crucial programs, including student loans, small business grants, healthcare funding, disaster relief and housing subsidies. 
For millions of Americans, these programs are not luxuries-they're necessities. They allow students to pursue higher education, assist families in maintaining a roof over their heads and ensure communities have access to federal assistance during hurricanes, fires and other crises. 
Students across the country who depend on federal loans to pay for their tuition may have to drop out due to an inability to pay fees. Families who rely on federal housing grants may find themselves in a position where they can't afford to make payments on their homes. Small business owners may lose the funding they depend on to help them grow. While this freeze may appeal to Trump's supporters, it displays an incredible lack of empathy for the millions of Americans who have become pawns in Trump's political game. 
Freezing the flow of federal funding that would drive innovation, empower future generations and alleviate financial burdens within communities-all of which contribute immensely to economic growth and success-makes absolutely no sense and will cost Americans in the long run. Trump's framing of this as saving taxpayers' money while not acknowledging the long-term cost of this decision is beyond irresponsible; it's terrifying. 
The notion that one person could cut off funding that supports millions of Americans who uphold the United States economy goes against everything this country stands for. It also serves as yet another reminder of just how immense the administration's power is and how serious the implications are when used recklessly.
 For the millions affected by this freeze, it's not about politics or left and right; it's about the ability to survive. It's about whether or not they will be able to pay their rent or finish their education. It's about whether or not the thousands of small businesses will be able to keep their doors open or communities will have the help they need to recover from disasters. 
This decision is not only reckless, it's unnecessarily cruel. The government was established to serve the people and work towards their interests, not leave them to fend for themselves. This federal funding freeze is more than just an administrative decision-it's an attack on Americans. It is an obvious abuse of power that places political games over the people these politicians are supposed to protect. This decision has a select few winners: those interested in minimizing government assistance and those who wish to ensure that only the wealthiest Americans have access to housing, healthcare and education.
