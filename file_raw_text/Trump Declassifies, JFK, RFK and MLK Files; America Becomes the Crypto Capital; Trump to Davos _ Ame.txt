LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": Charlie, Bingo, and it's why, as you've talked about before, it's why, you know, private schools, Christian schools, home schooling, online schooling is taking off all across this country.
Charlie, as always. Thank you. Great to see you.
All right, that's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media. Jesse Watters is next.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've accomplished more in less than four days than other administrations have accomplished in four years. They say that there's light shining all over the world.
WATTERS: Trump starts telling the world what to do.
TRUMP: A lot of people are waiting for this for a long -- for years.
JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: This kind of petty back and forth, or I would have beat Trump. (Bleep) believes that at all. Just get out of the way. The party is moving on.
WATTERS: Joe is out the door, so the left needs a new hero.
MARIANN EDGAR BUDDE, PRELATE OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH: It's a really big deal. I take it very seriously every time.
TRUMP: Why would somebody say that open borders are good. The only reason it can be is two reasons, you're stupid or you hate the country.
WATTERS: Migrant criminals get ICEd. Chris Hansen is here.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going back to Haiti.
WATTERS: Plus --
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: What's in the cups?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tequila.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lime.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lime tequila.
BELISARIO: Do you even know what you're drinking?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.
WATTERS: Fox News Alert: President Trump just signed an executive order declassifying and releasing all files related to the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lastly, sir, we have an executive order ordering the declassification of files relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
TRUMP: That's a big one, huh? A lot of people are waiting for this for a long -- for years, for decades. Everything will be revealed. Okay. Give that to RFK, Jr.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.
TRUMP: Okay, okay?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Only fair that Bobby gets the Sharpie. This order instructs the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to come up with a plan within 15 days for the full and complete release of the JFK files, and 45 days for the release of the RFK and MLK archives.
These are tens of thousands of documents that have never been seen before, that have been buried for over 60 years. PRIMETIME will have full coverage on the day they drop.
47 signed a flurry of executive orders this afternoon, and some of them could make you rich.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID SACKS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CRYPTO CZAR: This is the crypto EO. We're going to be forming an internal working group to make crypto, to make America the world capital of crypto under your leadership.
TRUMP: Which is really going up, right?
SACKS: Absolutely.
TRUMP: David, that's for you.
SACKS: Thank you, sir. You find them exciting? They might not be exciting, but you're going to make a lot of money for the country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: I don't own any crypto. Should that change? Trump says rates are coming down whether Jerome knows it or not.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The interest rates will come down.
REPORTER: You said that you would demand that the interest rates come down?
Do you expect the Fed --
TRUMP: Well, I would put in a strong statement.
REPORTER: Do you expect the Fed to listen to you?
TRUMP: Yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump is demystifying the idea that all of these Washington institutions are perfectly independent. Biden would never tell his Attorney General what to do. Obama would never talk to the Fed Chair about rates. I can't be seen talking to a justice, that would be unethical.
The Washingtonian virtue signaling is history. Presidents don't have to be shy about power, and having an opinion isn't illegal anymore. Trump is not whispering and tiptoeing around DC.
Same thing with Davos. Once a year, the financial elite gather in a tax haven, hire escorts and stroke each other's egos then dictate how the rest of us are going to live.
Brain implants, bugs for dinner, and willy-nilly windmills. Kerry is usually falling off his bicycle, and Al Gore screaming about rain bombs or misinformation.
This year though was a little different. The newly minted president Zoomed in as a symbol of disrespect and told Davos they aren't dictating anymore.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KLAUS SCHWAB, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Well, thank you very much, Klaus and hello to everyone in beautiful Davos. This has been a truly historic week in the United States.
Three days ago, I took the oath of office and we began the Golden Age of America.
What the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense. Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier, and more united than ever before, and the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we're doing and going to do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Davos didn't usher in a Golden Age, did it? Davos dictated DEI, mass migration, and attacks on cow flatulence. It isn't about what they want anymore, it is about what we want, and Trump is ripping up their wish list.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal. I call it the Green New Scam; withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate. We are going to let people buy the car they want to buy.
I mean, the Green New Deal was such a total disgrace, and it was conceived of by people that were average students, less than average students, I might add, and never even took a course in energy or the environment. It was just a game.
Remember the world was going to end in 12 years? Remember that? Well, the 12 years has come and gone.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The New World Order won't be set at a summit in Switzerland by bankers, politicians and economists who look like wooly mammoths. At one point, Trump name checked the Bank of America CEO. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Speaking of you, and you've done a fantastic job, but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America. They don't take conservative business.
And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives, because what you're doing is wrong.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: President Trump calling a bank chairman immoral ruffled quite a few feathers in the Davos dining room, but they couldn't do anything about it, and neither can Canada.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We're going to be demanding respect from other nations. Canada, we have a tremendous deficit with Canada. We're not going to have that anymore. We can't do it. It's -- I don't know if it's good for them.
As you probably know. I say, you can always become a state, and if you're a state, we won't have a deficit. We won't have to tariff you, et cetera et cetera. But Canada has been very tough to deal with over the years, and it's not fair that we should have a $200 billion or $250 billion deficit.
We don't need them to make our cars, and they make a lot of them. We don't need their lumber because we have our own forests, et cetera et cetera. We don't need their oil and gas, we have our -- we have more than anybody.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: America is beginning to reassert its economic advantage. We have the biggest consumer market, more liquid capital than any country, and the largest energy reserves, not to mention a bigger Navy than every nation on earth, and the dollar is the world currency.
So this country has an absolute right, an obligation to our own people, to set trade terms and not be taken advantage of. NATO spending, a perfect example.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I'm also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to five percent of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago. It was only at two percent and most nations didn't pay until I came along. I insisted that they pay, and they did, because the United States was really paying the difference at that time, and it was unfair to the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Why aren't the Europeans paying more for their own protection? Why are we paying the bulk of NATO's budget? That's like a security guard paying a client to protect them.
NATO is an incredible Alliance. We just have to get our books in order so our allies don't get a free ride, because while they get a free ride on defense, they are ripping us off on trade. They tariff American goods, but we barely tariff European goods, and that's about to change, and the Saudis better start pumping.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Saudi Arabia will be investing at least $600 billion in America, but I'll be asking the Crown Prince, who's a fantastic guy to round it out to around $1 trillion. I think they'll do that because we've been very good to them.
And I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And if the Saudis don't round up $400 billion, Trump will visit Israel first.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: You said you're going to ask him for a trillion? Will Saudi Arabia be the first foreign country you will visit, since they're investing that much money?
TRUMP: Well, if they do that, I would, yes. I would be glad to do that. I did it as you know, four years ago, we did $450 billion, meaning the money all goes to American companies, and they purchased jets and they purchased computers and everything else and we did $450 billion and I guess we're at 600 to 650.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump is shopping around his first foreign trip to the highest bidder. And it's not like he's getting the money, you're getting the money. These are investments in America.
Trump is treating our country like an NFL free agent. You know, I really want to sign with Buffalo, but LA is offering a much better package. Globalism is over, and we're taking Davos down with it.
We're not going to let multinationals outsource production and sell product back into the US, duty free. We need to protect our workers and supply chains. Fiat-Chrysler met with Trump, and now they're restarting a Jeep plant in Illinois and building Dodge Durangos in Detroit.
Samsung is about to move production from Mexico into the United States. Canada wants to help Trump restart the Keystone pipeline, and the president just lifted a pause on liquefied natural gas exports, so we can sell the Europeans natural gas and wean them off Russian energy, which makes our country wealthier, our allies safer, and slows down the Russian war machine, forcing Putin to the negotiating table.
And by the way, check your 401(k), the S&P 500 just hit a fresh record high.
And guess where Marco Rubio's first trip is as Secretary of State, Panama. What a powerful message to send.
Things are moving again, and the administration is in the zone.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "HANNITY": At any point did you doubt you would be back here?
TRUMP: So it's a great question. It's something I don't think about. I never really thought about it. I don't think about, "Gee, will I be back?" I just do it. I get it done. I get things done. I'm good at getting things done.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley says Trump is not making surgical strikes, but saturation bombing Washington. Obama promised to fundamentally transform America, but Trump is actually doing it.
There was this myth that there was gridlock in Washington. The country was divided and change was slow. That just gave professional politicians an excuse for three-day work weeks. They didn't want you to know real change was possible, because then we'd raise expectations and they'd have to actually do their jobs and actually represent our interests instead of their own.
But now they have an excuse for their lack of action. "The New York Times" says it's the Return of the King: Trump embraces trappings of the throne.
The media wants you to think only a tyrant could get things done in DC. They want you to think what Trump is doing is not in the American tradition. He's a wannabe dictator.
No, he's not. Just because he's playing with a sword doesn't make him Napoleon. This is what it looks like when you beat four cases, survive two assassination attempts, and sweep every battle ground. A president with political capital who knows how to use it with gusto and precision.
Lawyer Mike Davis told "The New York Times," "This election was a referendum on Trump, on MAGA, and on lawfare, and the American people rendered their verdict on November 5th. He earned power, and now he is going to use it like Democrats.
Democrat presidents use their power to put foreign nationals on welfare, bribe voters with college loan bailouts, and print money to dish out to donors. Democrats did all of that after their elections. They never campaigned on any of that. They tried to hide it.
The difference is Trump is doing exactly what he promised to do, and the voters ratified the mission. We're living in a time of populist rebellion. Journalist, Karl Zinsmeister says this: "Voters let loose a genuine bull into the China shop of the ruling class, those who have dominated public life for a generation declaring that the sky is falling." Maybe their sky is falling, maybe their time at the top is over, but yours isn't. Your time at the top is just getting started.
The power is being returned to the people. No one could tell you what bank to use, what car to buy, what words to say, what food to eat, which shows to watch. We're the only ones who can get in our own way, so put your chin up and your shoulders back. Today, was a good day.
Substack columnist, Glenn Greenwald joins me now.
Glenn, how do you think people are grappling with the speed of the change?
GLENN GREENWALD, SUBSTACK COLUMNIST: I think it depends who the people in question are, if they're the people who have been ruling Washington with the same dreary bipartisan ideology that has kept the United States in the state of inertia and on the wrong track according to most people, those are the people who are petrified, as they've been at Trump for so long. You're seeing the reasons why the establishment has both hated and feared Trump because he doesn't abide by the bipartisan consensus in Washington that has kept this country on that wrong track, according to most voters.
But if you're the people who actually exercised your democratic right and voted for Donald Trump because you knew Washington wasn't working and you wanted someone in to go in and break it and actually do so with great speed and assertiveness and not be constrained by these artificial rules they create to safeguard the status quo, then I think you're very happy.
It is really the first time I've seen an election where a candidate stands up and makes a whole slew of promises about what they're going to do once they win, and then they win and they actually get into office and start doing exactly what they said they were going to do. T1hat should be the norm, but it's really the first time I've seen it in at least decades.
WATTERS: You're so right about the fact that there was a consensus to stifle change. It was a conspiracy to stop the people from getting what they were trying to vote for, and now you have a guy who is actually delivering on his promises, and they're calling him a King.
Do you expect to see the King label slapped on him now for the rest of the term?
GREENWALD: If he were doing things with as much force, but that served the interest of Washington elites, they would not be calling him that. The reason they're upset is not because he's taking decisive action. We have a very strong presidency in the United States that has only grown in power. You can debate that, but that's the reality of what it is.
What they're angry about and upset about is not that he's using it, but that he's using it for the purposes that he said he would use it for when running, namely, to place America first, to stop worrying so much about what elites in European capitals in Paris and in London and Berlin think, but instead to start thinking about what's best for the United States, even if that means breaking rules, even if it means Zooming into Davos and chiding publicly Jamie Dimon and the CEO of the Bank of America for what they're doing.
These are the kinds of things they've been so worried about, because these are the things that are effective.
WATTERS: Yes, they like the power, just not when he uses the power in ways that they don't like.
Do you think that he has the kind of political capital and coattails that can bring in an RFK, Jr., that can bring in a Tulsi, that can bring in a Kash Patel, or are those individuals still kind of on the fence here?
GREENWALD: Well, we saw with Matt Gaetz that the Republicans in the Senate are willing to say no to his nominees if they feel like their ideology is too far afield from establishment consensus. Every Democrat voted for Marco Rubio. They're going to vote for Elise Stefanik.
It's the ones who challenged the establishment, like Tulsi Gabbard and RFK who Republican senators, not just Democrats, are trying to stop and I think Trump obviously has a lot of power, but whether they can over -- he can override the establishment forces that are still dominant in his party, I think remains to be seen.
WATTERS: Yes, that will be a big test of wills, and whoever wins that test is going to have a lot of momentum going into the spring.
All right, Glenn, good to see you. Stay away from Panama.
GREENWALD: It is always good to see you.
WATTERS: It could be trouble.
GREENWALD: Yes, thanks, Jesse.
WATTERS: Not everybody at Davos likes Trump, but they can't deny the comeback.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GRAHAM ALLISON, DOUGLAS DILLON PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT AT HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT: Trump has done something no person in the world has ever done before. A dead man -- a dead politician has risen. This is the greatest comeback in political history.
WALTER MEAD, COLUMNIST: We need to also factor in, not only who's won, which is Trump, but who's lost, which is to say, us.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: What an admission. Host of "The Will Cain Show," Will Cain.
You've got to give it to them. I mean, at least they're aware that they've lost power, Will.
WILL CAIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE WILL CAIN SHOW": Well, it's undeniable. Good for them. They can see what color the walls are painted. They can state reality that they are the ones who have lost while Donald Trump, but more importantly, America has won.
I just listened to your monologue, Jesse, and your conversation with Glenn Greenwald. I just keep coming away from this. "Today on "The Will Cain Show," we came in right after listening to Donald Trump do another -- what was it -- 15-minute freewheeling executive order, Q&A session, and it just -- there's one word that keeps coming back. It's leadership.
He is a vision of leadership, and the world is falling in line. Corporations, foreign powers, they are falling in line with a man whose vision, luckily, as you point out for all of us, actually is America first.
WATTERS: And he's doing it, as Gutfeld says, and I hate to use his analogies, because it just going to inflate his ego, like an agent, like your agent, or my agent, or any NFL agent, it's -- you know, brass knuckles when they're trying to get a good deal for their client. Trump is America's agent, and he's just trying to get a good deal for the American workers, and that's something we haven't had in a while, have we?
CAIN: And here's why, Jesse.
I've talked about this recently. You and I grew up essentially in the age of ideology. Everything was painted to us as though it was a decision between left and right, Republican and Democrat.
Now look, I am conservative. I suspect you Jesse, as well, lean to the right. So does Donald Trump, but he's practical, he's transactional, and he moves us beyond an era, I believe, where we replaced religion with ideology. Politics, at its very core is about the deal. It's practical, and nobody's better embodied that than Donald Trump, and it's rooted, as he points out, in a revolution of common sense.
WATTERS: Well, we're all enjoying "The Will Cain Show." I have to watch it because it's the only thing on before "The Five" but I've enjoyed it, and congratulations on a great start, Will.
CAIN Thank you. Blockbuster ratings, day one, despite the criticisms of my graphics, my background and my microphone from Jesse Watters and I will tell you now live to your audience and on air, I didn't even know I called you, Jessica Watters. I don't know how it came out. I don't know I said it, but now that I have it, it's a weapon in my tool belt.
WATTERS: You unconsciously misgendered me, and I will never let you get away with that again. Thank you very much, Will Cain. Great show. Off to a great start.
Jim Acosta, Adam Schiff and a naked predator, right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: The Democratic Party has descended into a Civil War. Factions are fighting for control. Right now, the name of the game is seeing who can throw Biden under the bus the hardest, and Clinton world is leading the charge.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CARVILLE: No one wants to hear from this guy anymore. Okay, just go to your condo in Rehoboth and stay there. And that's not because we're bad people or we are mean people. It was all his doing.
You had a noble career. Your last act was terrible. Just get out of the way. The party is moving on.
He created this himself. He has nobody to blame but himself.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Not wanting to be outdone, Obama world is jockeying just as hard.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID AXELROD, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: That was egregious that 10 minutes before the Inauguration, they announced that he's pardoned members of his family.
I mean, man up. You know what I mean? Man up. And if you're going to do it, do it, but don't do it literally, as you have one foot out the door, so you don't have to explain it or be accountable for it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Biden is out. Kamala is on ice, and Newsom lit his state on fire. All the left's heroes are tarnished. So who's going to run the party?
The resistance is getting more fringy and freakadelic. They're looking for a new star, but they're not sending their best.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Very calmly, very clearly gave us the illustrated dictionary definition of what it means to speak truth to power.
MARIANN EDGAR BUDDE, PRELATE OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH: There hasn't been much of a narrative outside of the narrative that the president has been describing, right, the -- it's people have gone quiet or they've been ignored.
The moment we're in it -- it filled the space that hadn't been occupied for a while.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump's been back in office for four days, and there hasn't been a peep from traditional Democrat leaders. Where is everybody?
The only calls Nancy has been making since she broke her hip have been to her stockbroker. My mistake, Nancy doesn't know anything about stocks. Pauly P has made some major moves after Trump won the election. The Pelosis must have gotten a tip about the Golden Age.
Adam Schiff tried to put his face out there, but he's been censured in the House and pardoned as a senator, and something seems off.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): So the president issued a number of executive orders last night. Let's break it down, but before I do. Banged my head, really dumb. Anyway, clumsy.
These are mass deportations. That's what he's saying also, and what that will mean is farm workers won't be on our farms. Food prices are going to go up. We will lose a lot of construction workers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Pick our crops and set our tables. What is it with these Democrats ever since the Civil War? Kamala says she wasn't going to go quietly, but she's been as quiet as a mime. Mamala launched a blog, though, and we clicked on it and she wants our e-mail address so she can ask us for money and she needs it because grocery prices are ridiculous. She just found out about inflation.
"The New York Post" caught her grocery shopping with Dougie Fresh. What kind of husband goes grocery shopping with his wife?
The Democrats in the media are attached at the hip, so when one goes down, they go down together. They can't function without each other. CNN is losing hundreds of millions of dollars. They're laying off hundreds of workers, and Jim Acosta is threatening to quit because the new chairman is making him work the graveyard shift.
A CNN insider saying this: "Jim is one of the least liked and most eye- rolled of all the talent at CNN, and this has been a long standing status. He's insufferable, an egomaniac. If he can make himself part of the story, he will. His jealousy is even visibly thicker than his makeup and hardened hair gel."
Wow. Acosta sounds worse than Greg.
Trump's new FCC chair just reinstated complaints against CBS, NBC, and ABC for their biased election coverage. Oh, and former POLITICO writers are turning into whistle blowers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARC CAPUTO, FORMER POLITICO REPORTER: I was covering Biden at the time, and I remember coming to my editor and saying, hey, we need to write about the Hunter Biden laptop. And I was told this came from on high at POLITICO, don't write about the laptop. Don't talk about the laptop. Don't tweet about the laptop.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: POLITICO responded in a statement to PRIMETIME saying, "It's BS."
Former Democrat donor, Nicole Shanahan joins me now. How are you, Nicole?
NICOLE SHANAHAN, FORMER DEMOCRAT DONOR: I'm very good. Jesse. How are you doing?
WATTERS: I am great.
Tell me about how the media has digested the Trump presidency so far?
SHANAHAN: Well, I mean, the left-wing media, the mainstream media, is in a tizzy. I think they only could get so much out of the Elon Musk-Nazi salute falsehood and they don't know what to do.
I mean, we see the party turning on itself. Chuck Schumer's statement that this was all Biden. It was all Biden's fault.
I mean, Biden is a geriatric patient. At this point, he's been managed by handlers. He could barely get through a press conference, let alone a full day of presidential activity.
You know Chuck Schumer, that's completely false. You know exactly who's been handling Biden, you've been involved with it, as has Nancy Pelosi. They've been running the show and in their embarrassment and in true lame old Democratic Party outrageous fashion, they point fingers at each other when things don't turn out their way.
WATTERS: Kamala Harris --
SHANAHAN: Donors are upset that -- yes.
WATTERS: Yes, I mean, I would be upset if I were a donor too. They just lit your money on fire and then told you, too bad. Give me some more money.
Kamala Harris doesn't know what she wants. She wants to go grocery shopping with her husband, and that's fine. Where do you see or what are you hearing about Kamala world now?
SHANAHAN: Well, she's trying to rebrand, and you know, people within her campaign are looking around and asking, what the heck just happened? What was that? We just burned through billions of dollars, and a lot of it went to these celebrity endorsements, and the whole thing was a scam. It was all smoke and mirrors.
And they don't have a lot of authenticity over there, so Kamala Harris needs to rebrand, and I don't know that they're going to get behind her for running for California governor. I don't think she can win.
WATTERS: What about Gavin Newsom? I mean, that's -- he's got a heavy lift, and that's putting it lightly.
SHANAHAN: Yes, his term is up. He has reached his term limit. He is trying to go out on top. It's not looking good.
His state is on fire, and the people of this state are calling out his mismanagement, egregious negligence. In some cases, we have people running up to him and saying, I've been trying to clear this brush in these Parklands behind my house, and no one is coming out to do it. So, it is very problematic.
WATTERS: Well, it looks like Adam Schiff got punched in the face and we just hope he's okay, and we hope he heals quickly, because we have -- you know, we have a big heart here at PRIMETIME.
Nicole Shanahan, thank you so much for joining us. It's good to see you again.
SHANAHAN: Thank you.
WATTERS: Have a great night.
SHANAHAN: Great to see you, too.
WATTERS: Johnny at the Inaugural Balls. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Biden migrants in Boston are getting ICEd and Bill Melugin tagged along.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going back to Haiti.
BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: One of those threats is this illegal alien from Haiti. ICE says he's a gang member with 17 criminal convictions in recent years.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Bleep) Trump. You feel me? Yo, Biden forever, bro. Thank Obama for everything that he did for me, bro.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: You're not going to believe these new numbers. Days before the Inauguration, Border Patrol had over 4,000 encounters in just a couple of days. Yesterday, they had less than 500.
Mexico is falling into line, too, building giant shelters to prep for those massive deportations. Mexico is like, what are we going to do with all of these Mexicans? Well, they're going to need a lot of tents, because illegals are getting ICEd left and right, and not just by Trump, Chris Hansen is catching migrant criminals. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS HANSEN, HOST OF "TAKEDOWN" WITH CHRIS HANSEN ON TRUBLU: You gave her $50.00.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
HANSEN: What was that for? The $50.00 was for sex --
(CHRIS HANSEN speaking in foreign language.)
TRANSLATION: Sex with a fifteen-year-old girl.
(UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.)
HANSEN: Her niece was 15, and you said you wanted a (bleep) from her and we're going to pay her $50.00. Are you here in this country legally? Do you have US citizenship?
(UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.)
TRANSLATION: I'm illegal.
HANSEN: But you came here, Marvin, for --
(CHRIS HANSEN speaking in foreign language.)
TRANSLATION: Sex with a fifteen-year-old girl.
MARVIN, ILLEGAL MIGRANT: No, no, no.
HANSEN: You could go back to Honduras.
(MARVIN speaking in foreign language.)
TRANSLATION: No, please.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Chris Hansen is the host of "Takedown" with Chris Hansen and the "Predators I've Caught" with Chris Hansen Podcast. I mean, first of all, great Spanish.
HANSEN: Editing is my friend, Jesse. Editing is my friend.
WATTERS: So these people, they show up just like Americans ready for action.
HANSEN: A week ago tonight in Genesee County, Michigan, Sheriff Chris Swanson's ghost team and I did an investigation. Two illegal Hondurans showed up in the same night, among the other predators. Both had been in this country before, gotten kicked out, sneak back in and got arrested in this sting trying to have sex with a child.
And I can tell you, in the week that's passed, they've already been picked up by ICE on a detainer, and it's the quickest they've ever seen this happen in the history of Genesee County.
WATTERS: Well, from all Americans, thank you. You've done more than Biden's ICE did in four years already.
Tell me about this guy. He was naked?
HANSEN: Blount County, Alabama. Sheriff Mark Moon and his team, we had five guys show up in four days. Take a look.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you have the money?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Well, you know, take something off.
HANSEN: You know how to make yourself right at home, don't you? Have a seat on that stool right over there?
And what was your plan here tonight?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't really know.
HANSEN: You don't really know. Well, it looks like you knew, because you got naked in the kitchen of this house.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANSEN: Can you imagine this has happened only three times in 20 years of doing predator investigations, Jesse and the decoy online with the Blount County Sheriff's Office, you know, was a little cheeky and playful for what you'd expect from a 15-year-old.
But this guy walked right in, took a look at her. She said, well, strip naked and then I walked out to confront him, and he put his clothes back on. Thankfully, before I could have a discussion with him.
WATTERS: You're a brave man.
HANSEN: I see a lot of stuff, Jesse.
WATTERS: "Takedown" with Chris Hansen.
HANSEN: I see a lot of stuff.
