Today, Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg (R-MI) issued the following statement on the Trump administration's executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI):
"For too long, social justice warriors crusaded to mandate DEI in every corner of America. Instead of merit, skills, and ability, DEI devotees pushed policies that are antithetical to American exceptionalism. From the classroom to the board room, Americans have felt the negative effects. DEI has bloated education budgets while telling students what to think instead of how to think. And America's savers and retirees have been forced to funnel their hard-earned money into underperforming funds to promote the Biden-Harris administration's environmental and social justice agenda.
"I commend the Trump administration for dismantling DEI. Trump is setting America back on the path to a stronger, more prosperous future."
