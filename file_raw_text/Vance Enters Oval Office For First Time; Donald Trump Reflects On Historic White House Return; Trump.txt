LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": And Harmeet Dhillon, I assume she'll get confirmed very, very easily, and she'll be leading the charge if these companies do not abide by this executive order. Chris, now we need to make this law, but we'll continue to have you on to monitor this. Chris, thank you very much. All right, that is it for us tonight. Oh my God, there's so much news, but it is kind of -- doesn't it make you feel good, like things are changing, and it's really good. 
Enjoy this moment. Jesse is next. JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME. Tonight -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whose house is this? GROUP: Our house. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whose house is this? GROUP: Our house. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You chicken meatball headed mother (bleep). Whose house is this? WATTERS: Trump says, bye-bye DEI. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I said, basically, "eff you," cry more. I don't give a (bleep). ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": I was floored that Joe Biden pardoned his whole family. Let me tell you why. The most charitable interpretation is the Titanic is sinking, I've got a life raft for my family, but anyone else who challenged Trump, you better swim, or you're drowning. WATTERS: Democrats disgusted with Joe Biden. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): If they weren't the crime family, why do they need pardons? Right? THOMAS HOMAN, BORDER CZAR: This is a difference between the last administration and this administration. ICE is going to force the immigration law. ICE is back doing their job effective today. WATTERS: PRIMETIME gets an exclusive look into the first ICE arrests. Plus -- MAYOR CHERELLE PARKER, PHILADELPHIA: E-L-G-S-E-S-Eagles. WATTERS: Trump's already made himself comfortable in the Oval Office. He's back to giving tours and JD got the first one. (@SPEAKERJOHNSON/X VIDEO CLIP PLAYS) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You want to go? JD VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: After you. TRUMP: This is Margo. VANCE: Hi, Margo. MARGO: Good to see you. VANCE: Good to see you, too. Wow. JOHNSON: This is JD Vance's first time to step into the Oval Office. It's incredible. VANCE: This is incredible. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Trump reflecting on the magnitude of the moment. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "HANNITY": Let's talk about the moment you walked back in this office, this desk, this room, your carpet. How did you feel? TRUMP: Well, it was a lot of work, and as you know, I felt that we shouldn't have had to necessarily be here. It could have been done, a lot of work could have been -- it would have been over. We wouldn't have inflation. We wouldn't have had the Afghanistan disaster. We wouldn't have October 7th with Israel where so many people were killed, and you wouldn't have a Ukraine war going on. But with all of that being said, I think it's bigger. It's bigger than if it were more traditional. HANNITY: Only the second time in history. TRUMP: Yes. HANNITY: Somebody didn't have consecutive terms. TRUMP: Yes. Well, they say it's historically bigger. I don't know about that, but I can say it showed us a couple of things. It showed us that the radical left, their philosophies and policies are horrible. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And you can catch more of 47's first Oval Office interview with Sean at nine. Trump also released the letter that Biden left him in the Resolute Desk. Biden's little love letter to the dictator wishing him all the best in the next four years, may God bless you and guide you. He called him Hitler, tried to throw him in prison, and now he's like, "Dear Don, all the best. Your friend, Joey." What a phony. Trump is cleaning house. We're starting with a clean slate, and just like when you break up with somebody, you throw all the photos in the trash. (TikTok/SAVE.NOT.SOFTT VIDEO CLIP PLAYS) WATTERS: All the lazy bureaucrats are being put back to work nine-to-fives, five days a week, and in person, just like the rest of us. Imagine that. And it's leaving some bureaucrats anxious about having to go in, worried about not having a parking spot and having to sit cross legged on the floors because their desks were downsized, and Trump put out an executive order, it is Indian style again. And if you're going back to work and you refuse, Trump says you're fired. Over at the Justice Department, agents are getting handed pink slips and being told to pack up. All the career attorneys who have been there forever are getting canned. This has never happened before. Trump just fired four top immigration court officials, including the chief. Oh, and oh yes, DEI is officially dead. As of five this afternoon, every federal DEI office in the country got shuttered. DEI employees woke up this morning and found out their e-mails are suspended and they've been put on leave, and if any of them try to sneak back in and do undercover DEI, Trump is having his people blow the whistle. Oh and no more rainbow flags flying over government buildings either. Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ordering a one-flag policy at all US embassies across the world. Bye-bye DEI. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So this is about reforming the system of hiring in the federal government to ensure that merit is the lodestar of hiring decisions. TRUMP: Wow. As per the Supreme Court. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And other matters. Yes, sir. REPORTER: Mr. President -- TRUMP: Here's a big deal, merit. Our country is going to be based on merit again. Can you -- can you believe it? (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Trump wants people hired based on merit, not skin color or sexual orientation. This taxpayer-funded poisons being eliminated, and it's saving us billions in costs, productivity, and lawsuits. Joe Biden's paid flaks are now back on their heels. After bullying you for four years, they found themselves on the wrong side of history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PIERS MORGAN, FOX NATION HOST: Do you think there should be more than two genders in America? HARRY SISSON, TIKTOKER: Yes, I don't know what that executive order means. I don't know what the president declared. MORGAN: It means, there are two genders, male and female. Do you disagree with that? DAVE RUBIN, HOST, "THE RUBIN REPORT": How many genders are there, Harry? Come on, little guy, how many genders are there? SISSON: Yes, and look, again, these guys don't know what they're talking about, so they won't be able to answer the question. MORGAN: Harry, how many genders are there? BEN FERGUSON, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND HOST, "THE BEN FERGUSON PODCAST": How many genders are there? SISSON: What's the legal enforcer of that? RUBIN: How many genders are there, Harry? FERGUSON: How many genders are there? SISSON: What's the lead -- I'm going to use Joe Biden's answers, at least two. At least two. That satisfies the little crazy guys back on up there. MORGAN: Well, how many more other than male or female? FERGUSON: That's a TikTok answers. SISSON: There's at least two. There's at least two. RUBIN: Yes. MORGAN: Hang on, there's male and female. RUBIN: He is like human brain rot. MORGAN: Donald Trump says it is male and female. SISSON: Okay, Dave wash and Rubin, come on now. MORGAN: How many more are there after male and female, Harry? SISSON: There's at least two. Now, anyway, let me get back to what I was saying. FERGUSON: How many more are there? MORGAN: What do you mean at least two? What are the other ones? SISSON: There's at least two. There's at least two. MORGAN: What are the other ones? RUBIN: Harry, let's try it this way. You're a female, what is the other gender? SISSON: It's so funny, it is so -- (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Tomorrow won't be a very Happy DEI Thursday, but some deadenders are picking up the reverend's bull horn and still trying to resist. Let's check in on Tim Walz' home state of Minnesota. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whose house is this? GROUP: Our house. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whose house is this? GROUP: Our house. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You chicken meatball headed mother (bleep). Whose house is this? GROUP: Our house. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You listen to (bleep). You work for us. You can get -- no. You can get the (bleep) out of here or you can have someone drag me out and then it is going to be on you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You respect my (bleep) space. You're defying that just as you've defied multiple -- (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: In case you're wondering, his or her shirt says "transsexual menace." We didn't think taking tampons out of the men's room would create such a stir, but here we are. The ladies of "The View" said, oh yes, we're not DEI hires, Trump is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Donald Trump saying things that this country would be a meritocracy. You're talking about a man who didn't become the president of the United States because of merit. He hasn't had really -- he had no political experience whatsoever. He had no business experience. He was given everything that he has. He is a legacy hire. He is, if anything, a DEI hire, a didn't earn it hire. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Only on "The View" is Kamala Harris, who never got a single primary vote, not a DEI hire, but Trump is. Trump campaigned hard. He survived two assassination attempts, beat two impeachments, four court cases, and received more votes than any other human being in American history. He earned it, but Democrats are looking for a new Avenger, and they found one in a church. The woke Bishop that scolded the new president yesterday, on day two, is getting wined and dined by the media. She's like Maddow, but they're treating her like she's a whistleblower, and now she's on a media tour. She went to CNN and "The View." (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BISHOP MARIANN EDGAR BUDDE, GAVE SERMON IN TRUMP'S INAUGURAL SERVICE: I was looking at the president, because I was speaking directly to him, I felt that he has this moment now where he feels charged and empowered to do what he feels called to do and I wanted to say, you know, there is room for mercy. SARA HAINES, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": Do you think your message is being misconstrued and politicized? BUDDE: Well, sure. Yes, but I think if you read what I -- what I said, and I mean, how could it not be politicized, right? We're in a hyper political climate. That's part of the air we breathe now and I was trying to speak a truth that I felt needed to be said. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: She's lucky this didn't happen on day one when Trump was a dictator, because he'd lock her up. This wacky Bishop demanded Trump show mercy to the Biden migrants who are breaking our laws and the cross dressers who are in the ladies locker rooms. She says they're scared, and Trump should show more compassion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I was there with President Trump and everybody there was shocked and mortified by the disturbing comments from this bishop who chose to weaponize the pulpit. She had an opportunity to pray over the president and the vice president and their families who are sitting in the first pews, and she spoke about truth, which was very ironic, because words later, she spewed lies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Would the bishop show mercy if someone showed up to her church service? Cut the the line at communion, guzzled the blood of Christ, flipped over the body of Christ, and then snatched all the cash from the offering plate? We can have compassion, but not at the expense of civilization. The silly bishop's mercy is what's wreaking havoc on our borders and our inner cities and in the ladies rooms. Democrat mercy let thousands of killers into this country. Their mercy got Laken Riley raped and slaughtered. Democrats had mercy on anarchists who firebombed federal buildings in Portland, showed mercy to BLM after they ransacked and firebombed cities. They showed no mercy to the police when they voted to defund them, but Democrats want to put a guy in jail for 20 years for punching a cop at a rally that got out of control on Jan 6. Trump said these guys were overcharged, showed some mercy and said, "Eff it, release them all." That's actually a quote. So when the media isn't defending DEI, they're defending the Jan 6 charges. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR: Do you agree with President Trump's decision to pardon these violent people and releasing them from jail? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): If they were truly violent, no, but, but do I know that they were? I don't know that. ACOSTA: What do you mean you don't know that. BURCHETT: He also did not -- ACOSTA: We're showing the footage on the air right now. This is not Fox, Congressman. You can't just spin a tale and pull the wool over people's eyes. BURCHETT: I left -- ACOSTA: This is CNN. This is the news. We're asking you come on and tell the truth -- BURCHETT: And that's why more people are watching the Cartoon Network SpongeBob reruns right now, Jim. You all continue this -- this narrative attacking Trump. You just can't stand the fact that he won and that America spoke and that your view is very diminished. ACOSTA: Congressman, no. That's not the case. That's not the case at all. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: We want to be accurate here. CNN is not only losing to cartoons, they're losing to a baking show and RuPaul's Drag Race. And for the record, we don't think you should be able to punch a cop in the face and get away with it, but 20 years is a long time for punching a cop in the face, and these guys got squeezed into pleas. Biden just pardoned his whole family and a guy who shot two FBI agents in cold blood. Republican Senator Kevin Cramer says this: "Do two wrongs make a right? No, but two wrongs can at least get us to a fresh start." And Trump just wiped the slate clean by ending DEI and pardoning the Jan 6ers, it is a fresh start for the whole country. And now everyone is even, right? Well, we'll see. Former Speaker of the House K-Mac is here. All right, K-Mac, so bye-bye DEI. Is it ever coming back? KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: No, I think the rest of the country wanted this to go away. I mean, if you think about it, we're coming after the holiday of Martin Luther King. They want to be judged by the character of who they are, and that's exactly what President Trump is doing. I mean, what's so unusual is here we have a man who ran for office, made promises and is keeping him on the very first day. Why is that so shocking? This is what the American people voted for. They had a clear choice. And what's so ironic here is the Democrat candidate was a DEI pick. She never went through any campaign. They put her up and she lost. America has spoken, and President Trump is carrying it out. WATTERS: Well, Trump at the Rotunda promised to make Martin Luther King's dream become a reality and I guess he just did, because he killed DEI, so check that off the list. When you hear people talk about Jan 6, they're very upset about the pardons. How do you react to that? MCCARTHY: Well, one thing I say is there's a fundamental difference between what President Trump did and what Joe Biden did. President Trump literally told America, if you elect be president, I am going to pardon January 6, so you could make a decision. If you disagreed, don't vote for him. What Joe Biden did was tell the American public that he would never pardon his son. His son gets convicted, and then he pardons him, but then he goes and pardons his entire family in the last minutes, not telling the incoming president. But what's so ironic, to me, terrible about this. These are the people he was in business with. This is what everybody wondered, the Big Guy. This is where China sent their money. This is where they had so many LLCs and when one money came into one, they went around and put cash and he denied it the entire time. So is pardoning his family literally admitting he was involved because it was a family business? WATTERS: When you watch Trump, we showed some sound of him yesterday, squaring off against one of these wicked reporters, he seems really calm, and he seems to understand that he owns the full power of the presidency and he's ready to execute the duties and the responsibilities to the fullest extent, unapologetically. What do you think that means for the second term? MCCARTHY: Well, I think people have to understand President Trump is better prepared to do this job now than at any time in his life. Because first of all, when he went in in the first, true, he had never been elected before. He listened to people that didn't give him good advice. He only has four more years to go. But now he knows the job. He is kind of like Malcolm Baldwin. He's got the 10,000 hours. But what was even better, and it might -- and it was tough, he left the White House, because what happens? You get isolated in there. You don't get to see the American public. He goes out and no one would ever have to go through the battle that he did to win -- assassination attempts, persecution, trying to put him in jail. He had to fight so hard, but he sat with the American public. He knows what's going on, and the world sits in a different place. China is a different situation. Russia is in a different situation. He's prepared now, and he's fearless, and he knows he has four years to go. He's not going to waste one minute. He's going to go faster than the House and the Senate will be able to keep up. WATTERS: It would be like if I got fired from Fox, took four years off, reclaimed my position. Imagine how good I would be. Could you imagine? Not that I want to get fired, but could you imagine K-Mac? Wow. MCCARTHY: It's hard to imagine you even being better. But you know what? Constant improvement and knowledge matters. And you know, it kind of humbled this president, and think about the attack, the assassination attempt, that changes you. And you know what? It's for the better that he spent this time with the American public. WATTERS: Completely. MCCARTHY: And he's not going to let bad advice push him in the wrong way. WATTERS: All right, K-Mac, still recovering from the Inaugural Balls. He went to all of them twice. See you later. MCCARTHY: And you never once asked me to dance. WATTERS: A former Obama foot soldier comes clean. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: In his final act as president, Joe Biden pardoned Fauci. The pardons backdated to 2014, which was when Obama prohibited Fauci from funding gain-of-function research. Then a virus escapes from a lab that Fauci was illegally funding, kills a million Americans. Biden tanks the investigation and preemptively pardons the Fauchmeister. Then he pardons his entire family, also back dates them to 2014, which was when Hunter started flying all over the world selling access to his Pop. Did Fauci and the Biden family lobby the Big Guy for the pardon? Did money exchange hands? We're about to find out. And right after we uncovered that the FBI and government informants embedded in Jan 6, and that the Jan 6 Committee destroyed evidence, Biden pardons every Democrat on the committee, plus Cheney and Kinzinger. Speaker Johnson, says he's going to investigate the Biden pardon scandal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHNSON: What President Biden did on the way out, pardoning his family for more than a decade of whatever activity, any nonviolent offenses. It was -- it was breathtaking to us. It is disgusting to us. It probably proves the point, the suspicion that, you know, they call it the Biden crime family. If they aren't the crime family, why do they need pardons, right? Look, there's a lot of attention that's going to be paid to this, and I think that is appropriate, and we will be looking at it as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Long time Biden friends are revolted. Bill Daley, who was Obama's White House chief-of-staff says, "It's disgusting. It confirms that there are serious concerns about culpability." Daley said, "The Bidens will never wipe the stain from the former president's legacy." Preemptive pardons are shady as hell. Your people can abuse power and get preemptive pardons in the final seconds? A DC cop who testified to the J6 committee, he got a pardon. Why is Biden giving preemptive pardons to Capitol Hill Police who are on the scene on Jan 6? This officer is like, "Don't pull me into your cover up." (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL HODGES, D.C. POLICE OFFICER ASSAULTED IN JANUARY 6TH ATTACK: I'm disinclined to accept it, because I haven't committed any crimes. I haven't done anything wrong, and to accept, I know, legally, it's debatable, but in my mind, accepting a pardon is an admission of guilt. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: You don't want it? (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Not too long ago, Biden agreed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: Have you ruled out a pardon for yourself or any other additional members of the family? JOE BIDEN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself? REPORTER: Yes, sir. BIDEN: What would I pardon myself for? REPORTER: That's what I'm asking. BIDEN: No, I have no contemplation of pardoning myself. Anyway, I didn't do anything wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: So did your family and Fauci do something wrong? Because they're innocent until proven guilty, but you're stepping in and killing due process and putting them above the law, kind of sounds like a dictator. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Joe Biden ran and said he would never do preemptive pardons. It was an issue that came up when you were leaving in your first term. TRUMP: Sure. He thought -- he heard that I was going to do it. I didn't want to do it. I was given the option. They said, "Sir, would you like to pardon everybody, including yourself?" I said, I'm not going to pardon anybody. We didn't do anything wrong. Most of those people, they wouldn't have even taken a pardon. This guy went around giving everybody pardons. And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon and if you look at it, it all had to do with him. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Democrats keep telling us how clean and high minded they are right before they get right down and dirty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, "THE BREAKFAST CLUB" HOST: He said something and he acted like he believed it. Unlike the Democratic leaders that we have now. If you say something, act like you believe it. Michelle Obama said something and she's acting like she believes it. Barack Obama, the opposite. President Biden the opposite. I don't respect that. I respect Donald Trump up there giving his inauguration speech and telling all of them to their face, y'all ain't piss. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Tommy Vietor as a co-host of "Pod Save America" and former Obama spokesman. How many genders are there, Tommy? How many genders are there, Tommy? TOMMY VIETOR, CO-HOST, "POD SAVE AMERICA": The honest answer, Jesse, I don't care. I'm a libertarian. I don't care. You can be what you want to be. WATTERS: It's two, Tommy. It's two. VIETOR: You can be what you want to be, Jesse. Live your truth. WATTERS: Okay. Well, I'm not a Democrat, and that we know. What happened to the party? Whose idea was the coup. VIETOR: There was no coup that I'm aware of. January 6 was a long time ago, and that didn't result in Donald Trump staying in power. We want to talk about pardons though. WATTERS: There was no coup with Joe Biden? VIETOR: No. I mean, Joe Biden was -- decided not to continue running. WATTERS: Oh, he decided himself. VIETOR: I think a lot of members of the party made a case to him that he was probably going to lose, and lose bad. WATTERS: Made an offer he couldn't refuse. VIETOR: Sure. WATTERS: And now he doesn't have a library. VIETOR: Let's talk about the pardons for a minute. WATTERS: Sure. VIETOR: I think Joe Biden's decision to pardon his family sends a terrible message to the world. I think the presidential pardon power is far too expansive. I would love to see Congress come together and pass a constitutional amendment that says you cannot pardon yourself, you can't pardon your family, you can't pardon your staff. I think all your listeners would support that. WATTERS: Why did he pardon his family preemptively? VIETOR: But I also think it sends a terrible message to pardon people who beat the crap out of police officers on live TV. WATTERS: Yes. They were overcharged. VIETOR: I mean, doesn't that bother you? Daniel Ball assaulted a police officer and threw an explosive device at the Capitol entrance that detonated on 25 cops. WATTERS: Yes, they were definitely overcharged, but Trump ran on pardoning Jan 6ers and the country voted for him. So in a way, the country voted for these pardons. But let me ask you, why did he pardon Fauci? VIETOR: I don't know because Donald Trump put him on an enemies list, and Fauci was a man who was just doing his job in the midst of a pandemic. WATTERS: I haven't seen this enemies list. Can you show me this list? VIETOR: Read Kash Patel's book, the new FBI director. You should check it out. WATTERS: I haven't seen the list yet. VIETOR: It is not a long book. It is not long. WATTERS: I know there were FBI agents on the ground on January 6, and then they destroyed evidence in the committee, and then everybody gets preemptive pardons. What's that all about? VIETOR: Just doing kind of the greatest hits of conspiracy. WATTERS: No. VIETOR: Do you want to do lab leak now? Where do you want to go next? WATTERS: Was there a lab leak? VIETOR: The Jan 6 and FBI inside job, is that where we're at? WATTERS: Did you think the virus just came out of nowhere? VIETOR: Jesse, Donald Trump won, okay. WATTERS: Yes. VIETOR: Like we can move on from this stuff. Okay -- WATTERS: Oh, I'm not moving on. No, I'm not moving on, Tommy, because you guys deserve this. Your party is broken. What the hell happened? I've never seen your party so out of shape. You've got nothing here. You've got nothing here. What are you guys doing? VIETOR: Jesse, the Democratic Party had a tough cycle. You guys now control the White House, Congress, the media. You have social media with Elon Musk. WATTERS: We control the media now. VIETOR: Mark Zuckerberg bending the knee and sitting on the dais supplicating Donald Trump. WATTERS: Yes. VIETOR: So Democrats are down bad. We need a new generation of leaders. We need to tell people who we are and what we stand for. But also now is put up or shut up time for the Republican Party and in six months -- WATTERS: Well, you say you need a new leader. VIETOR: -- if groceries are expensive, if the Ukraine war hasn't ended -- WATTERS: Who is the new leader? VIETOR: It's on Donald Trump? WATTERS: Who's the leader of the Democratic Party? VIETOR: That's on these people who want to run for office to emerge. We've got some great governors -- Gretchen Whitmer, Wes Moore, Josh Shapiro. WATTERS: What about Kamala? VIETOR: Some great folks in the Senate. WATTERS: Is Kamala running again? Do you back her if she does? VIETOR: I don't know. That's up to her. WATTERS: You don't know. You don't know, Tommy, you're a big shot with a big podcast. If Kamala runs again, you don't know if you're going to back her? VIETOR: No, I'm going to decide at the time based on who's running. WATTERS: You're going to wait. VIETOR: Yes. WATTERS: You're going to wait. What an endorsement. VIETOR: That's crazy to you? WATTERS: You're going to wait. VIETOR: Okay. WATTERS: She's not good enough for you. So who is good enough? Gavin? He's letting his whole state on fire. VIETOR: Jesse, it feels a little early for an endorsement. No one has announced that they're in the race, right? We've got two years. We've got the midterm elections. Democrats need to show who they're for, what they're fighting for, and then hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire. He promised to end the war in Ukraine on day one. Let's see him do it. He promised to bring down the price of groceries. Let's see him do it. That's what Trump should focus on. WATTERS: You know, I'm mad about the eggs. We agree I can't get eggs in New Jersey. VIETOR: Why can't you find any eggs? WATTERS: If Trump's fault, we're going to hold his feet to the fire. What's up with Michelle Obama, by the way? VIETOR: She's great. What's up with Pete Hegseth -- WATTERS: Wait, wait, wait. VIETOR: -- a weekend anchor getting The Pentagon job and you're stuck you're talking to me. WATTERS: I can't afford the pay cut. VIETOR: You have a much bigger show. WATTERS: I can't afford the pay cut. What's up with Michelle though? Don't you think she should have gone to the Carter funeral or the Inauguration? VIETOR: I don't know. I don't do her scheduling. I think she can live her life how she wants. She's a former First Lady. WATTERS: Okay, well, thank you very much, Tommy. VIETOR: Thank you for having me. This had been fun. WATTERS: I really appreciate it. We played all the hits. VIETOR: It's great. All the best conspiracies I appreciate it. WATTERS: And they were all true. VIETOR: Right. WATTERS: The lab leak, J6, it was all true. We'll see you on your podcast. VIETOR: Come join us. WATTERS: Next time I'm in LA -- VIETOR: Come to LA. WATTERS: -- we will do it. VIETOR: Come sit down. WATTERS: All right. VIETOR: All right, buddy. WATTERS: Do it three-on-one. The first ICE raids of the Golden Age. We have the exclusive pictures of the bad hombres. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Fox News Alert: The largest mass deportation operation in the US history has begun. PRIMETIME got its hands on exclusive photos of ICE raids from across the country. In New York, ICE arrested El Salvadorian illegal Jose Roberto Rodriguez, with ties to MS-13. In Miami, six Guatemalan illegals were captured. All of them had lengthy rap sheets, including battery, child abuse, fraud, DUI, trespassing, and vandalism. In Baltimore, ICE arrested Miguel Ramirez Fajardo, a Mexican national who illegally entered the United States, His only crime breaking into the country that we know of. And in New York, again, ICE nabbed Camaro Denver Hay (ph) , a Jamaican who was previously arrested for possession of child porn. These are just some of the hundreds of illegals that ICE apprehended in the last few days. South America, Africa, the Middle East, these guys are from all over, and they are some of the most violent criminals you can think of -- homicide, sex, assault, smuggling, kidnapping, robbery, battery, drugs, and weapons offenses. This is all happening as The Pentagon sending 1,500 troops to the southern border. And it's not just ground operations. The Coast Guard is moving vessels south. Some going to the Gulf of America. For four years, we were told that Biden couldn't fix the border crisis through executive action, and yet, there Trump is reinstating the remain- in-Mexico policy, killing Biden's border app, erasing catch-and-release and designating cartels terrorist organizations. Biden had banned ICE agents from arresting illegals in what he called sensitive areas. These sensitive areas included schools, hospitals, places of worship, any place where children gather, social service centers, disaster areas, funerals, weddings, protests and parades. A criminal alien could be serving fries at your daughter's school cafeteria, and ICE wouldn't be able to go in and get them. A migrant sex trafficker could be luring little girls into his van at a playground, and ICE couldn't touch him. If El Chapo himself was roaming around the Pacific Palisades, ICE would have to leave him alone, because it's a disaster area. A Biden migrant gun trafficker attending the wedding of a Venezuelan national in New Jersey, ICE couldn't grab him. ICE couldn't grab either of them. ICE couldn't even slap handcuffs on them at the cocktail hour or at the reception, because that's technically still the wedding. Even if a Biden migrant stormed the Capitol on January 6, sorry, it's a protest, ICE isn't allowed to arrest him. Biden created sanctuaries within sanctuaries, mini sanctuaries, but Trump ended that with a stroke of a Sharpie, and the House just passed the Laken Riley Act. It's on his way to Trump's desk. That bill just took two weeks to move through the House and Senate, so Congress can get things done if it wants to. And this just in, if local or state politicians try to interfere with mass deportations, Pam Bondi is going to put them under investigation. Deputy Chief-of-Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Adviser, Stephen Miller joins us now. So this big sweep nabbed a couple of bad guys. What's next? STEPHEN MILLER, DEPUTY CHIEF-OF-STAFF OR POLICY AND HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: Yes, well, as you mentioned, Jesse, the initial immigration raids have already arrested and removed some of the most vicious criminals in this country, including child pornography cases, homicide cases, sexual assault, attacks on children, and this is just the very beginning in the effort to liberate this country from the migrant criminal threat. In the coming days, you're going to see a massive scale up in enforcement activities all across the country to dismantle these criminal networks. And not only is it going to be ICE engaging these raids, but also they're going to have support from their law enforcement partners in FBI, ATF, DEA and US Marshals. We're going to leverage the full power of federal law enforcement at President Trump's command and direction to save this country from this occupation. You're also going to see, as you mentioned, the Department of Justice pursuing civil and, if necessary, criminal charges against anybody who shelters or harbors criminal aliens, that includes individuals in sanctuary cities who are harboring violent and dangerous criminals from federal law enforcement. The tables have turned, and now those who protect criminal aliens are going to face the legal consequences that exist in statute. And at the border, as you mentioned, the military is enroute. They are mobilizing active duty National Guard, as well as a massive effort to engage in military construction along the southern border to impede and deny the entry of illegal aliens and to send anyone who crosses home, or if they've engaged in criminal activity, we also may face -- they also may face significant criminal prosecution. So every instrument, every lever of federal power, is being deployed to crush the cartels, dismantle the gangs, seal off the border, halt the invasion, and send the illegals home. WATTERS: So Miller, if Mayor Bass, Mayor Johnson, if they blockade ICE from going in, if they sabotage the mass deportation efforts, they could be arrested. MILLER: The law is clear that harboring any legal alien, smuggling any illegal alien, obstructing law enforcement, obstructing an official proceeding and a conspiracy to violate the rights of Americans -- all of these and many more are criminal statutes. And so if there is incidences that occur where a public official or an elected individual engages in violations of those criminal statutes, then I fully expect the Department of Justice will follow the letter of the law, because, as I'm sure you know, Jesse, no one is above the law, not illegal aliens, and not anyone who may choose to illegally harbor those aliens. So this is a warning to anybody who is trying to obstruct ICE enforcement activity, if your obstruction violates federal law, then you face criminal jeopardy. So again, this is just applying the plain letter of the law, inducing, harboring, smuggling, trafficking -- these are all crimes. This is also another message to people who are trafficking children. Child trafficking is a 20-year prison sentence. You traffic a child, you are going to be in jail for a long time, and Pam Bondi's Justice Department is going to see to it. And I will also say, with respect to sanctuary cities overall, they are going to be flooded by federal law enforcement to find and remove these criminal threats. The law of this nation is being restored by President Trump. The sovereignty of this nation is being restored by President Trump, and the cartels are being designated as terrorists, and they are going to be sent packing. WATTERS: All right. Stephen Miller, everybody, thank you so much. You've been warned America. Behind-the-scenes at the Trump White House with Kai Trump, that's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Time for "Watters' Cooler." Let's bring in Fox News host, Julie Banderas. First up, Julie, Trump is launching a luxury real estate venture, and we're not talking about The Donald, Barron who we estimate now is nine feet tall saw his father's success and has some ideas for the New York City skyline, and the people approve. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And then I have a very tall son named Barron. Has anyone ever heard of him? (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: But Barron wasn't finished. He needed to settle some family business with the Big Guy shaking Biden and Kamala's hand. Nobody knows what he said, but I'm sure it's nothing personal. What do you think he said to Joe and Kamala? JULIE BANDERAS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Oh, yes. Oh my God, nothing personal. I think he went into -- did you see Joe's face? I've watched this video so closely. He's like, I mean, honestly, I think he was like, I will cut you six different ways for all the crap you said about my dad. I really do think that he said something disparaging about the fact that he has disparaged his father for so many years, and now he is getting back at him. There was nothing kind that was said in that little -- WATTERS: I mean, whatever he said, Biden actually heard it, and he's very hard of hearing. BANDERAS: Well, I was actually surprised, though, because he didn't say it out loud. He said it quietly, and he actually heard him, anyway, I was surprised by that. WATTERS: Maybe I'm going to raid Rehoboth next. Biden locked America out of the White House for four years. Trump saying, come on in. 47s' granddaughter, Kai is giving us an unprecedented behind- the-scenes look at Trump's Inauguration. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAI TRUMP, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S GRANDDAUGHTER: Today, my Grandpa becomes president of the United States again. Let's go. You want to say something to the vlog? DONALD TRUMP, JR., FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S SON: Yes, I want to say something. I love this little Smurf so much, and I'm so proud of her. TRUMP: Another famous Trump, my granddaughter Kai. Stand up, Kai. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was cool though. KAI TRUMP: That was successful. That was good. Got a shoutout from Grandpa. We're good guys. Now, we're heading to the White House to the White House to see my Grandpa and then ride with him to the Liberty Ball, where I will be dancing the chop and slide. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How many times have you been to the White House? KAI TRUMP: I've been to the White House, maybe 20. We used to play hide and go seek around the compound of the White House. It was me, Barron and Donny, also in the front lawn. Me, Barron, and Donny would play soccer. By the way, welcome to the White House. We're in the White House now. ANNOUNCER: Don, Jr. and Kai. Ivanka and Jared. Eric and Lara. Tiffany and Michael. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What was it like being up there? KAI TRUMP: I was lost. Dad was a horrible dancer, by the way. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Oh, that's mean. He probably is a bad dancer, though. That video is now number two on YouTube, even surpassing the Inauguration itself. BANDERAS: I have to say, that was super, super sweet, I have to say. And a lot of these kids that are children of wealthy, successful politicians, business people are just brats. But you watch this video and you fall in love with her. I actually -- I have nothing condescending or sarcastic to say. WATTERS: And for the first time ever. BANDERAS: For the first time ever, I actually, genuinely thought this was very, very sweet. WATTERS: That is sweet. BANDERAS: She truly looks up to her dad, which I think -- I love that. WATTERS: We didn't get this kind of access from Biden's granddaughters. BANDERAS: No. WATTERS: And grandsons. And it's just different. BANDERAS: Well, there is also that grandchild that he doesn't acknowledge, who doesn't have a voice because they don't exist. WATTERS: There you go. That's more like Julie. BANDERAS: Oh shoot. Oh no. I am trying to be genuine. I am sorry. WATTERS: Don't ever try to be genuine. BANDERAS: Okay. WATTERS: It's a huge weekend for Philly. I'm pretty pumped. The Eagles are one win away from the Big Game, but let's just hope they can play better than the mayor can spell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PARKER: Let me hear you all say, E-L-G-S-ES. Eagles. Let's go birds. (END VIDEO CLIP) BANDERAS: That is so sad she couldn't afford to buy a vowel for $250.00. It was just $250.00 to buy a vowel. WATTERS: That poor woman. BANDERAS: Poor woman. WATTERS: All right, well, I am not going to say anything mean. BANDERAS: Hooked on Phonics. Hooked on Phonics did not work for her. But I still don't judge her. WATTERS: You just say all the mean things. We are not going to go that way. It will be bad luck for my Eagles to criticize the mayor. If they lose, it is all her fault. BANDERAS: Is it? Really? Is it really? WATTERS: No. BANDERAS: No. She can't spell. I am sorry. WATTERS: I'm just superstitious. BANDERAS: Okay, fine. She was a really good speller. WATTERS: We elected a mayor who can't spell. BANDERAS: She's amazing. She's really grammatically correct. WATTERS: We're not going to do a Spelling Bee on this show, because that will just embarrass me. BANDERAS: Because I will win. WATTERS: I know how to spell just short words. BANDERAS: Yes. WATTERS: More from our movement next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: I can't get eggs anywhere. I mean anywhere. I can only get the bad ones that are just not yellow and aren't fluffy. For some reason in New Jersey, you just can't get the good pasture raised, nice, organic eggs. So Donald Trump, before you settle the drone issue, we need eggs, and we need them fast. Let's do some texts. Dave from Cincinnati, Ohio: Jesse, it was disgusting to hear you refer to a congressman with a nickname like K-Mac. Have some respect. What are you? His mother? John and Karen from Lancaster, California: Doesn't it feel good to have the adults in charge again? Yes, like Kai. Donnie from Cocoa, Florida: Nobody cares what "The View" has to say. America wants to know what Barron said to Biden. We should book Barron. John from Ashland, Ohio: If you never have Tommy back again, I'm fine with that. How many genders are there, Tommy? Pat from Omaha, Nebraska: If Tommy is a libertarian, then I'm Joe Biden's third son. Who also got a pardon. Pete from Marietta, California: You should have asked Tommy if he would endorse Liz Cheney for president. It's too soon. Donna from North Little Rock, Arkansas: The fired DEI employees could always go work for ICE. Brad from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: DEI's new pronouns are was, were. That's good. Frank from Austin, Texas: I started crying watching Stephen Miller tonight. Is it really happening? It's happening. Mass deportations are here. That's all for tonight. DVR the show. Hannity has Donald Trump up next. And always remember, I am Watters and this is my world.
