Key Facts
In hisproclamation, Trump said Black Americans have been among the United States   most consequential leaders,  naming Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, conservative economist Thomas Sowell, Justice Clarence Thomas and Tiger Woods.
Trump expressed  gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment  and for advancing  the tradition of equality under the law. 
Black History Month proclamations are typical for presidents, and Trump made one each year throughout his first term.
Trump s 2025 proclamation, however, is notably shorter than those he issued for Black History Month during his first term, and it makes no explicit mention of slavery, the Civil Rights Movement or landmark pieces of civil rights legislation, which he has cited in previous proclamations.
The proclamation also follows reports that theDefense Intelligence Agencywould pause events and activities related to Black History Month or other identity-based observances, including Pride Month and Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
How Does Trump s Proclamation Differ From His First Term?
In his2017 proclamation, Trump recognized the  toil and struggle  Black Americans have faced and voiced the  importance of teaching and reflecting upon  African American history though as president, he would later go on to criticize the teaching of  critical race theory,  and he demanded an end to teaching  discriminatory equity ideology  in anexecutive orderthis week. In2018, Trump recognized the  egregious discrimination and bigotry  Black Americans have faced and cited President Harry Truman s 1948 desegregation of the military.Trump s 2019proclamation opened with an anecdote about the slave trade beginning in the American colonies in 1619 and acknowledged many Black Americans have lived through  segregation, racial prejudice, and discrimination.  In2020, Trump acknowledged the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the  enduring legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Civil Rights movement,  commending Americans who have fought for  racial equality. 
How Has Trump Attacked Dei?
Trump has made eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion a cornerstone of the first days of his second term. Within hours of his inauguration, Trump signed anexecutive orderdirecting federal agencies to eliminate DEI programs and offices, slamming them as  illegal and immoral discrimination programs.  The following week, he issued anotherexecutive ordereliminating DEI programs in the military and the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, also effectively banning transgender troops in anotherexecutive order. Trump has also railed against DEI on Truth Social and in press interviews,baselessly claimingthat diversity hiring  could have  played a role in the fatal Washington, D.C. airplane and helicopter collision earlier this week. During a press conference, and in a post onTruth Social, Trump quoted now-deleted language from the Federal Aviation Administration s website that voiced a commitment to diversity and hiring people with disabilities, though this language existed on the FAA website throughout Trump s first term.
Tangent
Trump s attacks on diversity have been accompanied by awave of companies, including Target, Amazon, Meta and Walmart, scaling back their commitments to DEI.Targetannounced last week it would stop participating in external diversity surveys and phase out its Racial Equity Action and Change program, though it said it had reached this decision based on  many years of data. Metasaid last month it ended programs intended to increase hiring of diverse candidates, including its equity and inclusion training programs, with Janelle Gale, Meta s vice president of people, citing the changing  legal and policy landscape.
