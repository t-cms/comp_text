JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS HOST: Sean will be back next week in the seat on Monday with exclusive new interview that's coming up next week, in the White House with President Trump and Elon Musk, you're going to want to see that. As always, thanks for joining us. It's an honor to be here. Gutfeld is next. Have a great night. Happy Valentine's Day.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Happy VD, and Valentine's Day. It's Friday, so you know what that means. Let's welcome tonight's guests. He's been in more bars than Kamala Harris; entrepreneur and host of Bar Rescue Jon Taffer. This chef serves up a generous helping of hotness; Chef and Restaurant Owner, Andrew Gruel.
Her baby is going to go through puberty before it's even born; New York Times bestselling author and Fox News contributor, Kat Timpf. And grandmas want him for Valentine's Day; New York Times bestselling author, comedian and former NWA World Champion, Tyrus.
You've got to stand up with something. Did they block it? All right. Before we get to some news stories, let's do this. It's leftovers where I read the jokes we didn't use this week. And as always, it's my first time reading them, so if they suck, we'll send Joe Machi to Rashida to lead Kissing Booth. So, today is Valentine's Day, which means in New York City that after every stabbing, you receive a Russell Stover sampler.
According to a new poll, Joe Biden is the least popular living President. His supporters -- his supporters dispute that, saying he's dead. Meanwhile, a former Democrat donor claims Joe Biden was put on drugs before campaign events. Well, that explains the erection. Off the coast of Chile, a kayaker was caught on camera being swallowed by a humpback whale, prompting Joy Behar to say, I was nowhere near Chile. There's a rumor that Kanye West and Bianca Censori are headed for divorce.
Kanye, better not blame this on the Jews, or it's going to be hard to find a good lawyer. I don't know. I don't get it. It was funny. The LAPD brads are providing instructions for illegal immigrants on how to evade ICE. Advice includes blending in by not watching soccer. That's where you can find illegals. Just follow -- follow the shouting. The University of Michigan is apparently changing the names of its DEI offices to evade Trump's executive order.
That reminds me of when Osama bin Laden asked his friends to start calling him Jeff. As part of her bucket list, a 104-year old woman was allowed to spend some time in jail. I know. The high point was when she made some 90- year-old her bitch. It's funny. According to Anna Paulina Luna, who leads the task force on the declassification of the JFK assassination records, there were two shooters involved in JFK's killing.
Typical, I know, men kept that secret for 62 years. A woman kept it for 6.2 minutes. Chicks, am I right? Don't tell them secrets. Donald Trump met with the Prime Minister of India and pressed him to lower their tariffs toward the U.S. Trump even offered to throw in Ana Navarro, since in India, cows are sacred.
Trump said that Canada is a very serious contender to be our 51st state. All they have to do is learn how to pronounce about. Ilhan Omar might run against Tim Walz in the Minnesota Senate race. Poor Minnesotans, that's like having to choose between cancer and AIDS, because they're both bad. Elon Musk, Kat, you just got that that? Kat, can you stand up?
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No I disagree. What?
GUTFELD: Can you stand up?
TIMPF: You want me to -- OK, sure.
GUTFELD: Go to a shot a Kat, would you stand up?
TIMPF: Armed by the way I look -- OK.
GUTFELD: Come on.
TIMPF: I don't think people --
GUTFELD: OK, take a wide shot.
TIMPF: Thank you. Everyone shot with me and it is a wide shot.
GUTFELD: I don't think people understand how pregnant she really is.
TIMPF: No, at home, at home, you can't really tell from this angle. And then, when I was doing live, people see me out, they're like, whoa.
GUTFELD: All right. Back to the jokes. So, Elon Musk's four-year-old was mocked by The View over his name, prompting Musk's child to exclaim, daddy, I didn't know hippos could talk. NASA says an asteroids odds to hit the Earth by the year 2032 are up by 2.3 percent. Meanwhile, the odds of Jerry Nadler hitting the toilet bowl are zero. They're awful. Elon Musk revealed that paperwork for retiring federal employees is processed entirely by hand in an underground mine.
Here is a look at some of the workers. Someone in Pennsylvania stole 100,000 eggs from the back of a truck. And in a strange coincidence, guess who was spotted nearby with 10,000 pounds of bacon. A Florida woman gave birth on a New York City subway train. Not surprising, the baby's first words were, what the (BEEP) you looking at? They can't believe that, because it's a direct quote.
And finally, the sport's governing body known as the World Athletics is hiring staff to swab the cheeks of female athletes to make sure they are not trans. Which cheeks, asked one man. All right. To the monolog. So as Dow slices through our government waste at fraud and abuse, it would be nice to hear from the waste fraud and abuse itself, if only it had a voice. Oh, wait, it does.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can't spell felon without Elon.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump and musk like to say, we're reading out fraud, waste and abuse. We're looking at efficiency. That's a dog whistle.
REP. SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE (D-CALIF): Elon Musk ripped up the Constitution and our system of checks and balances.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Trump Administration and unelected billionaire Elon Musk have led a reckless and illegal attack on USAID.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 9 million veterans are watching you give them the middle finger, and we're not going to stand for it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So, watching the Dems react to DOGE is like watching a mobster plead with a cop to ignore the kicking noises coming from inside the trunk of his car. And now they care about the Constitution. Come on. We know they hate the Constitution because it's only one ply. Oh, toilet paper joke there. And we also know why they're really outraged. They're scared, but also offended that, for once, they're being held to the same rules the rest of us are, as in, those of us who worked in a business or ran one.
We've all been there, even if it's a lemonade stand, or in my case, a lemonade emporium, which put all those little (BEEP) bags in my neighborhood out of business. Yeah, in your face, Billy. Yeah, they're outraged that Trump is forcing them to show their work, go through the budgets, the line items, costs and overruns, losses and theft. And the reaction to this makes you wonder what they're hiding. So imagine if you opened a restaurant and you've already hired the bus boys.
Investors gave you a boatload of money to launch this huge undertaking, and a year goes by and those investors are showing up and asking, how's it going? And you say, not great, probably because you offered all you can eat shrimp to the wrong person. And the investors say, well, can you show us your books? And you say, no way. And then, you get angry at them for even asking.
Well, wouldn't a reasonable person say, that's odd. I give you money. And you think it's wrong for me to see where the money went? Well, that's the federal government, and as taxpayers, we're the investors. It's no different than running a bar, a diner, or anything that serves customers. It goes under if you don't keep tabs on the tabs. That's why Larry Kudlow is banned from Hooters and Cracker Barrel.
But, Dems have never had to keep anything within a budget, not even Pelosi's face, that alone cost $50 million. Fact is, Trump is basically running a nationwide version of Bar Rescue, where everyone can see how the sausage gets made and stolen. We just found out, for example, the Department of Health and Human Services blew $22 billion on things like cars, homes and startup businesses for migrants.
So, while victims of disasters were given 750 bucks to pitch a tent where their business used to stand, Venezuelan gang members in NYC just opened a tire ceiling butt clinic, butt implant clinic. Yeah , that's better. Worse, EPA Chief, Lee Zeldin revealed $20 billion was sitting in a private bank to be doled out to green energy companies that Biden abandoned without proper oversight.
I heard one green company received millions to produce Joy Behar nude calendars. That's to encourage people to turn out the lights. DOGE is also cleaning house at the Department of Education and yeah, even the IRS, auditing the auditors. What's next? Checking Jerry Nadler's secret expense accounts for liquid plumber? So, the story really isn't just the fraud. It's those freaking out about its exposure that puts them on the other side of the good guys.
We know eliminating waste and abuse is paramount, as is reducing the size of an arrogant bloated government. It's good for everyone, but whoever it's bad for are the ones screaming about it, because to them, government was never about helping you, but helping themselves. Jon, congrats on a new season of Bar Rescue. And then when I'm writing this, I was thinking about you going into the bars and basically looking at their books, and having to have that come to Jesus moment with them, which the Democrats find as an injustice and unconstitutional. What say you?
JON TAFFER, ENTREPRENEUR AND HOST OF BAR RESCUE: Well, first of all, they don't even list what the checks are for. And if I did that, the IRS wouldn't accept my taxes, I'd be in trouble.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TAFFER: Every check written has backup. They didn't even do the backup. The negligence is so disrespectful to us and our money. They're paying on contracts that expired 10 years ago. They're writing checks for invoices they never received for companies that we have no record of. There's no files, there's no backup for these things. This is criminal. In the civilian world, this would be criminal, would be extortion, but it's unbelievable.
So, they're screaming loud, and you're right, the extorters are the ones that are going to scream the loudest, and I can't wait till we follow the money.
GUTFELD: Yes. Andrew, you run your own businesses, is Musk doing everything right? Could he do anything better? What's your grade so far?
ANDREW GRUEL, AMERICAN CHEF AND TV PERSONALITY: Yeah, I think he's doing a great job. And also, I always love the episodes, Jon, where that you go in and you find the owners are drunk. So, I can't wait until we find out, like, we go in and Musk finds everybody drunk. You throw them out, right? You need to be there for that. But what's even funnier is, is the way in which the Democrats are actually arguing about this, right? Catching the falling knife, I call it.
This reminds me of a story, two hunters are in the woods, right? There's a big, big, deep hole and the two hunters are like, oh, let's throw something down the hole and see what's down there. We'll see how deep it is. There's a huge rock there. They throw the rock down the hole, and it just keeps going and going and going, and suddenly this guy comes running in. He's like, have you guys seen my donkey? And the hunters are like, you know, it's funny, you mentioned it. This donkey just went head first into the hole 200 miles per hour.
And the guy says, well, how is that possible? I had him tied to a huge rock. And in this little story, the analogy is, the two hunters are Trump and Musk, right? And the Democrats are the -- they're the donkeys just going down the hole following the rock. And they're like, we're going to die. Are you saying they're jackasses? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know. I don't know. And I don't know who the old man is.
GUTFELD: Yeah. You know this made me think, Musk should copy Bar Rescue and just force the congressman to clean refrigerators in the cafeteria, get on their hands and knees and scrape it,
GRUEL: Grease traps.
GUTFELD: Yeah, grease -- they're all grease traps. Kat -- Kat, you're in an episode of Bar Rescue this year.
TIMPF: Yeah, I am.
TAFFER: And by the way, Kat, when we filmed Bar Rescue, it was about nine months ago.
TIMPF: Yeah. It's crazy. Yes. Oh, there I am. Yeah, I had actually -- the look on my face really says it all too. Yeah, I had actually just found out I was pregnant, and I never thought I was going to be pregnant for the rest of my life. Here we are. Yeah.
GUTFELD: So, they keep calling Musk an unelected billionaire. I didn't know we elected billionaires.
TIMPF: Also, we didn't elect whoever was running the country the previous four years. You can't -- you cannot do that when your, you know, figurehead was literally a figurehead, and not even, and barely even that. I mean, he had difficulty remaining upright.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: You know, most like mascots that are like a stuffed animal can do that. You know what I'm saying?
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: So, you completely -- yes, people who are elected, then hire people and have a team that does stuff. I don't understand the argument. I don't know who came up with the argument. It's ridiculous. And also, all the money, it's not -- it's our money. We're the investors in the business. This is our money. And I understand it can be difficult to find out that people that you've trusted are stealing from you, because that has happened to me before, and I didn't want to see it. I didn't want to see it. But as soon as they're like, I don't look, it's like, you know, you've got -- you've got to know.
GUTFELD: Tyrus, thoughts on how it's going so far.
GEORGE "TYRUS" MURDOCH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think they need to continue reminding us that Elon is an unelected official. I think they need to keep beating that horse non-stop and saying it every chance they get. So, when we find the money we get to say, so you as an elected official who took an oath to uphold the Constitution and serve the American people, stole and laundered money, just to be clear.
I think that should add a few more years on the sentence, because they made an oath not to do that. So, the reason why they keep saying, he's -- he's - - so he has no end game, because he's not benefiting from it. He's already, you know, there's -- he wants money. If Elon called his team of accountants and said, bring me all my money to my house, I want to count it, we would not hear for him for 25 years.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: So, the guilty, it's always the worst villain that fights the hardest. It's always the one in your family member that's stabbing in the back that fights you the most. And it's not just Democrats, we need to -- we need to slow our role. Republicans who are doing it are scared right now because they can't do anything.
Their hands are tied, except the ones who are really in far too deep, like the old man. That's why he's freezing all the time, because he's like, oh, (BEEP) their jigs up. No. So, I think -- so I think it's very interesting, they keep saying unelected, let him keep saying that, because it's going to bite them on their jackasses.
There you go. All right. Up next, an identity shift leaves Dems a drift.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Why are so many men turning red and fleeing from Blue? Sorry, Dems, it's not about them, it's about you. A University of Chicago panel featuring OutKick's Clay Travis tried to figure out why more than one in five young liberal men voted for Trump, and generally, why more men identify as Republican over Democrat. That's when Clay offered his two cents. Roll it. Swen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAY TRAVIS, FOUNDER OF OUTKICK, WRITER AND LAWYER: OK, so what I would start with is men aspire to be bigger, stronger and faster than we are, almost universally. That's why super heroes are popular. That's why pro athletes are popular. Who is the most masculine Democrat right now in America? Mayor Pete?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is that a gay drive?
TRAVIS: No, no, Mayor Pete, no, well, no, it's just that he's not particularly masculine. Nobody's like, oh, Mayor Pete, he's a bad ass. Chuck Schumer, is anybody like, hey, you know Chuck Schumer holding up an avocado and a beer to talk about the Super Bowl? Is anybody like that trying to grill? Is anybody like, hey, that's a dude I want to hang out with.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But Trump's like a grandpa.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Yeah. Trump is like a grandpa, she says. Yeah, grandpa, you could kick your ass. I mean, not her ass, but just ass in general. She tried to get him there, but Clay didn't take the bait.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. Trump took a bullet in his ear and immediately stood up and said, fight, fight, fight. Every man in America, and most of the women out here were impressed by that, even if the women won't admit it, she's shaking her head strong. And, second part of this, basically summing it up, Democrats for men are pussies, and Republicans for men are pussies. There are no masculine men in the Democrat Party right now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Oddly, there was no reaction from the audience there. I haven't seen a crowd that stunned since November 5.
TAFFER: You know, Greg, I must remind you, Joe Biden did invite Trump behind the gym.
GUTFELD: Yes. That's true. That's true. By the way, I have a question for you, are there bars where you recognize it's a female bar? There aren't any because females want to be at bars where men are right? So there's --
TAFFER: It's true.
GUTFELD: There's no like gender, like, you want men to be welcome in spots. The Democratic Party made it unwelcome.
TAFFER: Yeah, they did.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TAFFER: It's like creating the anti-male bar. And those exist, paint it all pink and invite the guys for lunch, right?
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TAFFER: Years ago, we used to build bars for women, and the women's restroom was a palace.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TAFFER: And the men's restroom was an outhouse.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TAFFER: And we knew that if we had enough women, the men would stand online to get in the outhouse.
GUTFELD: That is true. That is true. Some men will stand under the outhouse.
TAFFER: Yes, they will, and climb over it.
GUTFELD: Yes. Andrew, does Travis have a point?
GRUEL: Yeah. Not only does he have a point, I mean, I can't believe that this is controversial. This guy is saying what my eighth grade science teacher told us, right, for years, like there was nothing controversial about this. And by the way, women's outhouse, women's bathroom, that's going to be name of my next restaurant bar.
You know, the thing is, is that this is, this is all truth. David Hog is the new representation of the Democrat party. I mean, the guys arms are like tooth picks, and this brings up a serious issue is, what's happened with testosterone these days? I mean, it truly is actually diminishing across the board, and anyone who's got low T is now moving over to the Democrat Party, so I think we need to address it through the HHS.
GUTFELD: The low T party. All right, Tyrus, we have been warning Dems for like two or three years about this, that their policies are anti-male. I mean, there's a subversion of law and order and security, like, the Second Amendment, these are all things that guys kind of understand.
TYRUS: Listen, these little think tanks, these little soiree he had, with his little group, it wasn't exactly the toughest group of four people you could assemble talk about, being tough. This is one of the problems I have with the Republican Party, is, we talk about (BEEP) nobody cares about. You're calling Democratics pussies, as if everyone here who goes to the gym didn't already know that.
We need to stop doing it. We don't know how to play with the lead, like, you go on these little think tanks and you try to be clever, but you're just insulting a whole group of people. Talk about the activists, who represent the Democratic Party, not the people who are in it, because they're Americans too, and they just think -- they think differently, but attack the individuals that you're calling out, because to say, oh, well, all the all the jack cool guys are Democrats or Republicans, and all the little guys, you sound like them.
That's what they do. We don't do that. And as I think I speak for every dude here who drinks a beer and drives a truck, we don't give a damn what another man's thinking about his political views when we get up in the morning. I don't get up walk and be like, I wonder if there are going to be liberal men in my place today. If I see a man bond, it's on, baby. No, we don't care. Like, and that's the thing is, like, that's why we won. We focus on things that are important, and we don't care if you got little wiggly arms or big thick arms, come on in, the water is fine.
GUTFELD: All right. Yeah. I think the question they're trying to get at is, can the Democratic Party win back men? And how would they do it?
TIMPF: Well, I'm not a man, regardless of what some people like to say on Twitter, they accuse me of faking my pregnancy, complete with very intricate diagram. I think it's a little different, just from the, I do know men and I've spoken to them.
GUTFELD: You're married to one.
TIMPF: Yeah, I'm married to one. There might be one in here, I don't know.
GUTFELD: Yeah, I think that's actually Dana Perino there.
TIMPF: I think it's -- it's not so much about who the Democrats are, is that they don't want men to be themselves, and telling you that the way you are is wrong or bad, and that if you are a guy who has more masculine energy than there's something wrong with you, and there's nothing you can do to make that -- and you need to just like grovel and grovel and grovel, and apologize and apologize and apologize, and even still then, you're still evil. I think that a lot of guys, the ones I talked to, were like, eventually, after years of years of this, like, you know what? Maybe just (BEEP).
GUTFELD: Yeah. No, it's a good -- it's a good point. It is like you have to, like, somehow be -- it's not be subservient to some prevailing like ideology and you're just like the kids (CROSSTALK).
TIMPF: Guys, I know who made the switch truly don't care what any other man is or does or the way that they represent themselves. They were sick of being told that them being themselves was wrong, no matter what they do.
TYRUS: Then they got to get rid of the activists.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: You can't have activists in your political party.
GUTFELD: And you know what? The activists gained new traction with social media, and they were able to exaggerate and amplify their role in everything.
TAFFER: They certainly amplified their role to fight, that's for darn sure.
GUTFELD: Yes, that's true. And they steered the Democratic Party down a dead end. But this show isn't at a dead end. In fact, we are just getting started. See, that's why I'm a professional. You see how I did that?
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: No, no, no, no, no, I don't need it yet.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So which music should you bump when you get dumped?
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(SINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you hurry you can catch them all, stories in the VD special.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Welcome to our VD special. So when your relationship falls apart, can music mend your heart? Rough Trade, the record store, not my hobby, put out a list of 10 breakup albums on this very special Valentine's Day. Among them "Blue" by Joanie Mitchell, "Blood on the Tracks" by Bob Dylan, Fleetwood Mac's "Rumors," "Back to Black" by Amy Winehouse. Sadly none of these are on my list. There's only one song I listen to when I am dealing with the breakup.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Young man there is a place you can go. I said young man --
It's fun to stay at the YMCA. It's fun to stay at the YMCA.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Kat, I must go to you first.
TIMPF: Yes. I'm an expert in breakups.
GUTFELD: You're an expert and you love emo. Is a good to listen to music that allows you to wallow in your bad feelings?
TIMPF: If you cry, because crying is good for you. You release endorphins. A lot of these are really good. I love it the Amy Winehouse one. It's great. If any of these songs ever come on and you are in the same room as me and you are a man, you better get out.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: Before I like look at you like this. But also, I think the best song ever is Janis Joplin. So Janis Joplin's "Pearl" I think has a lot of really good ones, especially "Cry Baby." The first time I saw her sign that at Festival Express, I was sitting there with my college boyfriend, and I was like, I'm going to go find myself. They really are all like this.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: And it changed my life, because there really is nothing hotter and nothing you want more than a man to cry over the thought of his love without you.
GUTFELD: That's good to know, but it's too late for me.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Tyrus, do you have a heartbreak album?
TYRUS: No.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Heartbreak albums is a young man's game. When they came in today and asked me to pick one, I had to go all the way back to when was the last time my heart was broken, because you have to get your heart broken to become a man. And you go through it once. So I think at the time it was After 7, "Til You Do Me Right", or something like that. And then everywhere you go, everything looks like her. Every time, if she has brown hair, every person with brown hair walking, is that her? No, she is gone, bro. She's not coming back.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: And then you get wisdom and you get older, and now when they're like, I'm leaving you, you're like, cool.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: It's true.
TYRUS: Men get to a point where you are just like, hey, all right, then, well.
GUTFELD: Yes, that feeling does not come back.
TYRUS: Keep on trucking.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Andrew, is there some powerful music that you listen to when you - - you have been married for a long time.
GRUEL: Yes, about 40, 50 years, I think.
GUTFELD: Yes, it's amazing. Just For Men on your beard as you --
GRUEL: Yes. Well, or just for women?
The thought of album idea, I couldn't wrap my mind around it intellectually because what I remember is the mix. We need to bring back the mix. You remember the mixtapes? And the beauty of the mixtapes was that you could in one moment be melancholy and listening to Radiohead, which was my chosen album, but then go into hardcore punk, like "Sick of It All" or something, just go wild. And it made me move into psychedelic pop rock, Phish, "Bouncing Around the Room." Because when you are in emotional despair, you have no idea what direction you're going in about 90 seconds.
TIMPF: That's true.
GRUEL: So it's like, maybe it is melatonin Mondays, I don't know.
GUTFELD: Jon, have you ever had your heartbroken?
TAFFER: I have, but I'm sort of in the same boat that Tyrus is. I had my heart broken once, but my song after that is "Hit the Road, Jack."
TYRUS: That is funny, because "It's the Jack" AC/DC or actual bottle of Jack when things get tight. Sipping of course.
TAFFER: Connects the dots.
GUTFELD: What is the most popular song on a jukebox in a bar?
TAFFER: For a long time "New York, New York," was the highest once. I still think it is songs like "Hotel California."
GUTFELD: Wherever you go that song is everywhere. Enough already. Enough. I don't need to hear that again. I'm going to go with "Hatful of Hollow." The Smiths, Morrisey is the greatest singer when it comes to melancholy. See, nobody agrees with me.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: You do. That's good. That's good. All right.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Coming up, liberal shrews are feeling the blues.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A story in five words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Liberal women are still unhappy. So Tyrus, this is almost like the flip side of the B block. A recent study found that liberal women are much less happy than their conservative peers, with 12 percent of liberal women reporting they were completely satisfied with life, 12 percent. Apparently, they don't know you, Tyrus.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: I would argue that is the 12 percent of that have.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: But again, I don't care. I wouldn't -- a liberal woman. Again, I hate the boxes and labeling. It's like, you know, I don't know any woman that's ever completely happy. And what I mean by that is when you first start out together in a one-bedroom apartment and you're barely making ends meet and a good night out is one night a week you go to Chili's, and everything is great. Then all of a sudden you build and you build and you have a giant house and you can have cars, you have this, and it's the same -- complaints. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. The things switch and change. You can literally have Jesus as your butler and she will still be like I didn't ask him to build it that way. There is always a problem. And that is not a liberal thing, conservative thing. That is a -- woman thing.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Kat, you're about to explode?
TIMPF: I wish. I do have a lot to say about this, actually.
GUTFELD: Sure.
TIMPF: Sorry.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: So I've always considered myself a feminist in the Salt-N-Pepa iteration of feminism, where it's like, yes, I'm a woman, but if you're going to judge me for doing stuff you wouldn't judge a man for doing, then -- you and I am impowered and all this stuff.
I think that for some a certain iteration of feminism that is more liberal, it is not so much about what you can do but what is being done to you. And that ceases to be inspirational or empowering at all. And at a certain point if you don't feel like you have any control or any agency over your own life, then who wouldn't be depressed by that?
GUTFELD: You know what it is -- it is like a shrimp. A shrimp?
TIMPF: Where are you right now?
GUTFELD: I was thinking about Chili's.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: It is like going to a shrink, and the shrink indulges your personhood rather than trying to work you past that. It's like the Democrat Party is like saying you are a victim, you are a victim.
TIMPF: Good therapy is a great, but bad therapy is worse than no therapy.
TAFFER: Could it be that they're married to liberal men?
GUTFELD: Maybe. But a lot of them, a lot of them aren't married. The primary supporters of Biden were single women. But maybe they were single for a reason, if you know what I mean.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: I don't know. Now Tyrus is making me feel guilty. He is staring at me.
TYRUS: No, no, no. A lot of them are ugly as hell. I'm with you.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Andrew, what say you? As a man who, again, is happily married I am sure.
GRUEL: Very, very happily married. Happy Valentine's Day to everybody, including my beautiful wife.
TYRUS: You son of a bitch.
TIMPF: He should have said especially.
GUTFELD: Yes, my dear wife.
GRUEL: This is about answers in life that just can't be answered, right. So Democratic thought process and general liberals, it's about answering why. The why behind everything. It's all about equity and fairness and equality. But that is not how life works, right. One of the biggest cliches we learn right away is that life isn't fair. We know that. We know life is not fair. Deal with it, take the punches, let it make you tougher.
But they are always looking for that equality, and the answers aren't coming, right, because it never works. It's like, OK, well, now we're going to try and force equity, we're going to force quality. And it doesn't work. So all of their answers are constantly wrong. Imagine if you kept failing every single test, you'd be depressed, too.
GUTFELD: Yes, it's true. It's like their filter. If you have an incorrect filter on life, nothing is going to --
GRUEL: On everything.
GUTFELD: Good point. Wow, we are so deep here.
Up next, Viewer Mail!

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yep, you are watching Mailing It In.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE) GUTFELD: First question from Fuezie -- that's a great name. "What is your favorite sound that brings a smile to your face?" Let's go around to you, Jon, what kind of a sound when you hear you go ahh?
TAFFER: Barking dog.
GUTFELD: A barking dog. Interesting.
TAFFER: Better than a barking person.
GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes. You're not a prowler, I take it.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Andrew?
GRUEL: I would say birds chirping in the springtime.
GUTFELD: Oh, that's a nice answer.
GRUEL: Happy Valentine's Day.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TAFFER: And happy Valentine's Day to my wife. He got me into this, so I have to do it.
GUTFELD: Yes, both of you are definitely cheating.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I kid. I think. Kat?
TIMPF: The sound of Cheens eating, because if he is eating that means he is not having a flareup of his IBD. And when I hear that little, I'm like, OK, then I don't have to give him his Pepcid AC, and I have to give him human Pepcid AC which is really difficult to do because you have to give a quarter of a tablet. They're not scored. So what you have to do is crush it up and divide it into four piles. I had to do that earlier this week. And I did it on a plate.
And then left it there. And then our dog walker came over. He was being weird around me and I didn't realize why until I saw that I realized it looked like I was doing cocaine alone in the afternoon.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: Pink cocaine.
TYRUS: While pregnant.
TIMPF: No, the 20 milligram tablets are white. So he was being a little weird, and I was like oh, it's Pepcid AC. If you snort that you will be disappointed.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: But the sound of Cheens eating in the morning so I don't have to do any of the medication.
GUTFELD: That is your 13-year-old cat, 14.
TIMPF: Fourteen-and-a-half.
GUTFELD: Wow, amazing. Tyrus?
TYRUS: Silence.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: I'm sorry. I'm just an old man now. But when I hear nothing, I am like, yes.
GUTFELD: That is so -- you know what? I never appreciated it until I became a dad.
TYRUS: There's nothing like -- you have been a dad for seven, eight minutes. Calm down.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I had, I liked the sound of a V-8 engine of like a car made in the 50s when they were really made well. But no, silence beats that. Silence.
Ken Leek asks, "What is the biggest fib told as a kid?" Andrew?
GRUEL: There was this one time that I ended up throwing up all over my parents' bed, and I blamed it on the dog.
GUTFELD: There you go, back to the dog. Tyrus?
TYRUS: I told everyone at school that Robert Parish was my dad. And when the Celtics played the Lakers, he wanted to know if he could get tickets, and then I told him he was a deadbeat dad.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Kat?
TIMPF: That I had a secret closet in my house I could walk into and turn into a dog. Not that weird.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Jon?
TAFFER: Mine was generic. I didn't do it.
GUTFELD: Ah, very good, very good. I think when I was a kid, I would tell kids I was a transfer student, and that's why I appeared so old.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: We'll be right back.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Watch his new show "Bar Rescue," Jon Taffer, Andrew Gruel, Timpf, Tyrus, studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
