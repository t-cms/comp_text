Amid Onslaught on DEI, Pressley, Booker, Colleagues Reintroduce Historic Reparations Bill During Black History Month
H.R. 40 Would Form Commission for Develop Reparations Proposals for African Americans
Bill Text | Press Conference
WASHINGTON - Today, as the nation witnesses an unprecedented onslaught against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives from the Trump Administration, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) are announcing the reintroduction of H.R. 40, legislation to establish a federal commission to examine the lasting legacy of slavery and develop reparations proposals for African American descendants of enslaved people. The bill, which comes during Black History Month, is a powerful counterweight to the harmful actions taken by Donald Trump and a call to action for America to address the systemic oppression of Black people throughout its history.
Rep. Pressley and colleagues formally announced the bill at a press conference on Capitol Hill. Footage of the press conference is available here.
"What we're seeing from the Trump Administration and their allies in Congress and the courts is a coordinated, years-long effort to dismantle any policy that uplifts Black folks and addresses America's shameful history of systemic racism. It is anti-Blackness on steroids and we're not backing down in our pursuit of healing and reparatory justice," said Congresswoman Pressley. "H.R. 40 is a powerful reminder of the work that remains and offers us a pathway toward truth, reconciliation, and accountability for the deep, structural injustices that continue to ravage Black communities to this day. I am grateful to Senator Booker for his ongoing partnership and I am deeply honored to follow in the footsteps of my mentor and friend, the late Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, in introducing this deeply necessary and overdue legislation."
"We as a nation have not yet truly acknowledged and grappled with the ways slavery, racism, and white supremacy continue to disadvantage African Americans," said Senator Cory Booker. "Commissioning a study to better understand where our country has fallen short will help lawmakers better address the racial disparities and inequalities that persist today as a result of generational injustices."
H.R. 40 would create a federal commission to examine the lasting impact of slavery, systemic racism, and racial discrimination on Black Americans and explore reparative measures to address these harms. The commission would hold hearings and gather testimony from impacted communities to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive process for truth-telling and policymaking.
Joining Congresswoman Pressley in announcing the reintroduction of H.R. 40 are former Congresswoman Erica Lee Carter--the daughter of the late Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee who was also the former House co-lead on H.R. 40--as well as Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Chairwoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Congressman Jonathan Jackson (IL-01), Congresswoman Summer Lee (PA-12), and Congresswoman Lateefah Simon (CA-12). The legislation also has the support of Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Chair Adriano Espaillat, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) Chairwoman Grace Meng.
"My mother, the late great Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), was vigorously committed to ensuring that H.R. 40 Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act moved forward in the United States Congress to address the long-standing racial disparities that exist in our country. While she is no longer here to fight, we know that the issues remain and activism for reparations continues," said former Congresswoman Erica Lee Carter. "It is my honor to witness Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) pick up the mantle to become the lead House sponsor for H.R. 40. She will carry on the legacy begun by Congressman John Conyers, admirably led by Congresswoman Jackson Lee to add her own passion, commitment and perspective. The journey of the formerly enslaved in America is a story that has never been properly told at the federal level. It is long overdue for us to acknowledge and address this terrible history."
"From school boards to the White House, Trump and his lackeys are on a mission to erase the contributions of Black Americans - including the unpaid black labor upon which much of our country was built," said Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman. "We won't allow this history to be erased because when Black history is erased, when the value of the contributions of Black Americans is dismissed, it's that much easier to dismiss the value of Black lives."
"The America we know today was built on the brutal enslavement and trafficking of stolen Africans forced to build this country on their literal backs. Despite what Trump and his anti-diversity, anti-equity, and anti-inclusion cronies want you to believe, this is American history," said Rep. Summer Lee. "Our government - no matter who is in power - has an obligation to right these wrongs. If we are to truly address the racial and economic injustices rooted in this country, Congress must pass HR 40."
"Every American deserves a fair shot at success, and that means expanding opportunities for Black Americans who still feel the impact of centuries of racist and discriminatory policies. The systems that were set up for the purpose of holding back Black Americans must be dismantled with equal purpose," said Rep. Grace Meng, Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. "Yet President Trump and Congressional Republicans are doing the exact opposite -- eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and cutting vital programs that will hurt Black Americans and communities of color. These are the wrong priorities. We need to expand opportunities, close the racial wealth gap, and rectify discriminatory policies that have harmed Black Americans for generations. Thank you to Rep. Pressley for championing this bill, and I stand in solidarity with my Tri-Caucus colleagues in support of this legislation."
The Commission established by H.R. 40 shall be composed of 15 members, who shall be appointed, as follows:
* Three members shall be appointed by the President;
* Three members shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives;
* Three members shall be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate; and
* Six members shall be selected from the major civil society and reparations organizations that have historically championed the cause of reparatory justice.

Rep. Pressley has consistently advocated for race-conscious policies to help close the racial wealth gap in America, uplift Black, brown, and other marginalized communities, and transform the criminal legal system to center the dignity, humanity, and equality of everyone who calls America home.
Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Booker are the lead co-sponsors of the American Opportunity Accounts Act -- also known as Baby Bonds--legislation that would create a federally-funded savings account for every American child in order to make economic opportunity a birthright for every child and help close the racial wealth gap.
Congresswoman Pressley is the lead sponsor of the People's Justice Guarantee (PJG) - her comprehensive, decarceration-focused resolution that outlines a framework for a fair, equitable and just legal system.
Last year, Rep. Pressley and House Oversight Ranking Member Jamies Raskin introduced the Federal Government Equity Improvement Act and the Equity in Agency Planning Act to codify racial equity across federal agencies and improve government services for underserved communities.
