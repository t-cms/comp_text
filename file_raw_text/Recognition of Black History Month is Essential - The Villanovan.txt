Recognition of Black History Month is Essential
Natalie Murphy, Staff Writer
February 19, 2025
Graydon Paul Black History Month is crucial to acknowledge and critically discuss.
February is remembered by many for Valentine's Day: an annual celebration of pink, white and red. One of my favorite memories of my childhood was buying an assortment of candy and dropping it in my classmates' colorfully-decorated paper bags on Valentine's Day. A day commemorating happiness and romance has a powerful message, but there is something much more important: Black History Month is a celebration of joy, resilience and love.
The origins of Black History Month are swept under the rug by the United States education system, and thus, the majority of the population. 1865 was a transformative year. It marked the passage of the 13th Amendment, which legally abolished slavery. Black joy could be heard from all corners of the globe. 
However, this was only the beginning of a long struggle for political, economic and social equality. Half a century following the 13th Amendment, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (known today as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History) decided to commemorate the work of Black leaders. The celebration, a week long, was set to fall within the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass (). During the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Black History Week transformed into Black History Month. It was first recognized by the national government in 1976 by President Gerald Ford (). 
Black History Month serves many purposes and is significant to many different people. It honors the progress led by the Black community, serves as a reminder for younger generations of their opportunities to achieve change and raises the concern of our historical education and its racial erasure. It is a reminder of quotidian acts of resistance, seen for centuries and often forgotten, as well as the power of Black institution building, such as churches and schools. There are many parallels between Black History Month and the unity and solidarity people of color found within Black institutions throughout enslavement. Black History Month reminds people of the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality and religion, and the unique power of their existence; but also, an even greater identity: the human race. 
Throughout the decades, there has been an overwhelming amount of political backlash against the government's recognition of Black History Month. In a recent report, the Trump administration has ended recognition of celebratory identity months, including Black History Month, Pride Month, Asian American and Pacific Islanders Month and Women's History Month. This end of government recognition should not and cannot be normalized. It is dehumanizing and it is reminiscent of the past tragedies of American history. The government historically banned so many symbols of unity; they were extremely fearful of the power that people of color wielded. The same can be said for identity-based months. So much history surrounding people of color is eradicated from history textbooks and classroom discussions.
However, it is important to remember that celebration of Black History Month should not serve as a scapegoat for change. Since the beginning of Trump's presidency, dozens of companies have used Trump's executive measures to end DEI initiatives and fire employees who stand for company inclusivity. Similar events happen during pride month, as many companies change their logo to rainbow colors to promote publicity. Black History Month, as well as any identity-based month, should never be used for profit. It is a sad reflection of our economic system and society to normalize using identity for corporate gain. 
Black History Month is more than just a month. It is seen everyday in our decisions of defiance. While we still have much progress to make and more paths to forge, government recognition of Black History Month and other celebratory months is an essential stepping stone for acceptance and equality. Trump's erasure of Black History Month should not be generating silence in return. Organize, educate, listen and fight.
