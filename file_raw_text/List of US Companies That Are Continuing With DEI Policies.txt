Several U.S. companies are steadfastly maintaining their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives despite President 's  dismantling federal DEI programs.
Why It Matters
On the day of his inauguration, Trump issued an  directing federal agencies to terminate all federal DEI programs, describing them as "public waste."
"Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great," the order reads.
The order also encouraged private companies to follow suit, leading to a reevaluation of DEI initiatives in both public and private organizations.
What Is DEI?
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion encompass policies and practices that organizations implement to promote representation and participation of all people of all backgrounds.
This includes people of various races, ethnicities, genders, abilities and socioeconomic backgrounds. DEI aims to ensure fair treatment, access, opportunity and advancement for all, while striving to identify and eliminate barriers.
Companies Continuing With DEI
Several companies have publicly reaffirmed their commitment to DEI policies or have taken action to boost diversity and minority communities. Those include:
Delta Air Lines: Despite industry trends, Delta remains . Chief External Affairs Officer Peter Carter said on an earnings call in January: "DEI is about talent, and that's been our focus."Costco: The retail giant continues to uphold its DEI programs. In January, the company's Board of Directors recommended against voting for a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research, which would have evaluated and published a report of risk associated with the company's DEI efforts, per ABC News.Apple: Maintaining its focus on diversity, Apple has resisted external pressures to roll back its DEI initiatives. Last month, the company's board of directors asked shareholders to reject a DEI rollback proposal.e.l.f. Beauty: The cosmetic giant, sold at retail stores like Walmart and Target, touted diversity and inclusion policies last month with a marketing campaign, per CNN Business.Meijer: The supermarket business "reaffirmed" its commitment to expanding Black-owned brands to meet customer interest and demonstrate its support of small businesses in a press release.Procter & Gamble: The company that oversees brands like Charmin, Tide and Tampax provided a statement to The Cincinnati Enquirer in February that said equality and inclusion is good for business. "This cannot and will not change," CEO Jon Moeller told the outlet. "It's critical to who we are and what we do, to our principles, values and purpose and most importantly to winning."Sephora: The beauty brand premiered its first film, Beauty & Belonging, at Sundance Film Festival in January, which celebrated diversity and authenticity. Over 75 Sephora employees were interviewed for the special.
What Happens Next?
The future of DEI initiatives in the U.S. remains uncertain amid political and legal pressures. While some companies have scaled back their programs due to the executive order, others have stood firm and rejected the demand to remove diversity and inclusion roles.
