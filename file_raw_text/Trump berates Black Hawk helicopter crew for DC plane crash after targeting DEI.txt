Air controller's scream of despair at moment of crash
President Donald Trump tore into the performance of the Army Black Hawk helicopter team who died in a fiery crash with a passenger plane at DC's Ronald Reagan Airport, asking how they could have botched their predetermined flight route.
The extraordinary online missive from the Commander-in-Chief on his Truth Social account came just a day after he blamed diversity hiring practices among air traffic controllers for the crash which left 64 dead in the Potomac River near the White House.
Two of the deceased Army helicopter crew members have been identified. A female co-pilot has yet to be identified, but Fox News reported she had 500 hours of flying experience. They are among the 64 who died int he crash.
'The Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit. That's not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump posted Friday morning.
On Thursday he ordered an investigation into the fiery crash.
                     The New York Times reported that the helicopter flew a half mile outside of its approved flight path, and was at about 300 feet during impact when it should have been below 200 feet. 
Trump's new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Friday: 'We're looking at altitude, and the president was clear about that: someone was at the wrong altitude. The investigation will help us understand that. Was the Black Hawk too high, was it on course? Right now, we don't quite know.'
Trump also said Thursday that both aircraft were at the 'same height' during an extraordinary pair of White House events where he blamed D.E.I. hiring practices for the crash and then dismissed a trip to the recovery site with a joke about swimming.
Trump's brief post about the Black Hawk's fatal flight path comes a recovery efforts to continue at the site where American Eagle flight 5342 and the Black Hawk on a night training mission crashed.
The flight instructor has been identified as Chief Warrant Office 2 Andrew Eaves. Both he and the unidentified female copilot were being evaluated during the flight. 
'We ask that you pray for our family and friends and for all the other families that are suffering today. We ask for peace while we grieve,' his wife Carrie Eaves posted online.
Ryan O'Hara has been identified as the crew chief. He had a wife and one-year-old son.
Trump declined to criticize the military night time training exercise when asked about it Thursday. Nor did he raise issues with the heavy flow of air traffic at the nation's busiest runway. 
His immediate complaints about DEI drew howls from Democrats.
'It's one thing for internet pundits to spew up conspiracy theories. It's another for the President of the United States of America to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families are still being notified,' said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York. 'It just turns your stomach,' he added.
