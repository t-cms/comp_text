There sless turnover in the C-suiteif last year was any indication.
Theaverage executive tenure was 4.9 years, up slightly from 4.5 years in 2023, according to research from executive search company Spencer Stuart. The longer tenure is a sign that businesses are recovering from the shakeup caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, says the firm s Ed Stadolnik.
There s also been a significant increase in diversity leadership positions. The data only covers 2024, so it doesn t reflect changes prompted by the Trump Administration s anti-DEI stance. Still, the figures suggest companies view such initiatives as critical to long-term success.

Nvidiareported robust earnings across the board,bringing in $39.3 billion in revenue in its fourth fiscal quarter, the company s first report since the debut of the less tech-intensive DeepSeek AI model from China. Still, it was the weakest top and bottom line growth for the company since the quarter that ended April 2023, and shares traded slightly lower in after-hours.

The order, which excludes cards with charges related to disaster relief,seeks to transform federal spending on contracts, grants and loansto ensure accountability from government employees, according to its text.

Elon Musk and GOP lawmakers haveramped up attacks in recent days on judgesissuing unfavorable rulings against the White House, claiming they re  corrupt  and should be removed from office, but federal rules and Republicans  narrow majority in Congressmean any impeachment efforts are likely to fail.

"We ve got to look for the opportunities," Liberty Bank CEO Alden McDonald says. "O for obstacles. O for opportunities. 
Daniel Brown for Forbes

TOPLINENearly 20 years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the scars are still visible. But one beacon of hope is Liberty Bank,the largest Black-owned bank in America.
Founded in 1972, Liberty has grown from $2 million in assets to more than $1 billion. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the bank has $948 million in deposits, making it the largest bank for Black Americans by asset size. Liberty serves 11 states, and, as president and CEO Alden McDonald Jr. notes proudly, has been profitable for 47 of its 52 years. The bank has achieved this by focusing on lending to underserved communities and, like all banks, generating revenue from fees and interest.
Known as Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) or Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Black banks like their Hispanic and Asian counterparts fall under federal oversight andplay a vital role in many neighborhoods. Historically, Black banks have financed small businesses, churches, and individuals who have traditionally faced discrimination from larger banks.
Currently, there are 23 Black banks in America, down from 46 in 2001, but their combined assetshave increased from $5 billion to $9 billion over the past quarter century. The FDIC categorizes these banks based on their leadership structure and equity. Washington, D.C.-based City First Bank, a Black-led institution, leads with assets of $1.3 billion, primarily due to a merger with Broadway Financial in 2021. Liberty follows closely behind with $1.1 billion.
 Most Black banks are still surviving today,  McDonald says. But few have thrived like Liberty Bank.
WHY IT MATTERS Alden and his son Todd are working to repair the relationship between Black Americans and commercial banks.  We have more networking and more contacts for more things than any other type of industry,  Alden says.  When you need something, you pick up the phone. If we don t know, we know somebody else who will know.
