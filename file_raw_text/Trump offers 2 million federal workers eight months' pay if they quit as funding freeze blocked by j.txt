Donald Trump has offered over two million US government employees eight months' pay to quit as part of his administration's ambition to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget. 
Federal workers received an email with the subject line "A Fork in the Road" from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Tuesday evening. 
Those who were willing to accept the "deferred resignation," which would be effective immediately with pay and benefits until September 30, would simply have to reply to the email with one word: "Resign." 
Staff will be expected to meet four criteria: Five days a week in the office; updated performance standards to ensure "excellence at every level"; department downsizing; enhanced conduct standards to ensure "trustworthy," "reliable" and "loyal" employees. 
The scheme is exempt for personnel of the Army, Postal Service, and those in national security and immigration positions. 
Staff who opt to stay cannot guarantee their jobs, as per the OPM email.

James Liddell
Robert F Kennedy Jr is the next controversial pick for Donald Trump's cabinet to face a grilling from Senators, as he prepares for his confirmation hearing Wednesday for head of the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
Kennedy is facing a predictably skeptical reception from both sides of the political aisle as he pursues his bid to become HHS Secretary, owing to his long history of comments and activism against vaccines - which he has falsely blamed for causing autism in children.
Also on Wednesday, Pam Bondi is due to be considered for the role of Attorney General; Howard Lutnick as Commerce secretary; and Kelly Loeffler to lead the Small Business Administration. 
On Thursday, Daniel Driscoll is set to be considered as secretary of the Army; Kash Patel as FBI director; Tulsi Gabbard as National Intelligence director; RFK Jr (again); Elise Stefanik as Ambassador to the United Nations; and Russell Vought as director of Office of Management Budget.

Donald Trump has tasked SpaceX owner Elon Musk to "go get" two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station for more than half a year.
Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore have been stuck in space for the past seven months after problems with the Boeing Starliner concerned NASA, leaving them stuck on the ISS. The trip of the two astronauts was originally meant to be around eight to ten days.
The SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon was originally planned to retrieve the astronauts in February, but it was moved to at least late March.
Late on Tuesday, Donald Trump publicly asked Musk to return Williams and Wilmore to Earth.
"I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to 'go get' the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration," he wrote on Truth Social. "They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!"
Hours before Trump's message, Musk preemptively accepted the challenge, tweeting: "The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long."

A federal  has temporarily blocked 's  from freezing federal grant funding across government agencies, dealing a setback to the White House's plan to pause federal programs that don't align with the new president's political ideology.
US District Judge Loren AliKhan issued the two-day temporary restraining order after a brief hearing in Washington on Tuesday.
The order, which is meant to preserve the status quo while legal proceedings continue, follows a lawsuit from a coalition of nonprofit organizations and small businesses that warned in court documents that the order "will have a devastating impact on hundreds of thousands of grant recipients" who depend on the steady flow of grant money that they've already been awarded and "deprive people and communities of their life-saving services," including health care services, LGBT+ community support and services to support small businesses.
