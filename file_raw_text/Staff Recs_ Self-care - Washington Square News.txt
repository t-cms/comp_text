It's freezing and the world feels like it's ending. Take care of yourself.

Kiara Mujica (Kiara Mujica for WSN)
As we settle into the beginning of a new semester in this freezing cold weather, it's important that we take the time to practice self-care. While the beginning of the semester may mean higher stress levels and fewer successful New Year's resolutions, taking a moment to step back and relax may be the last things on our minds, but it's important nonetheless. We at the Arts Desk have rounded up our favorite pieces of feel-good media that are essential to our self-care rituals.
"Writers & Lovers" by Lily King
A coming-of-age book that avoids all stereotypes, "Writers & Lovers" is a reminder that everyone is always figuring out life. Casey Peabody, a 31-year-old aspiring writer and waitress stuck in her dead-end job, is grieving her mother while avoiding insurmountable debt. On top of it all, a love triangle further complicates Casey's life. The book is messy and relatable, as Casey stumbles her way through finishing a manuscript. 
My favorite part is when Casey visits a psychologist, saying, "I'm scared that I can't even handle this right now, how will I be able to handle bigger things in the future?" He simply says, "I don't know, my friend. This is not nothing." It reminds you to slow down, and take things one at a time.

"Eat, Pray, Love" by Elizabeth Gilbert
Call me the most basic woman in the world, but I adore "Eat, Pray, Love." Elizabeth Gilbert is a 30-something divorcée who realizes she needs to make a big change in her life after her marriage falls apart. Spiritually and emotionally, she is run down. Already an established writer, she receives a large advance from her publisher to spend a year traveling the world on her own. She eats in Italy for four months, prays at an ashram in India for four months and then finds love in Bali during the final four months of her trip. Gilbert learns to meditate, pray, be comfortable on her own and love again. 
While it may be cheesy, the story involves many things that bring me peace: meditation, Italian food and solitude. I highly recommend both the book by Gilbert and the 2010 movie.

Le Cinéma Club 
I'm beginning this year resolved to become a better media consumer so that I can be a better writer and creator. I would be lying if I said that my AMC A-List subscription wasn't what keeps me up-to-date with movies, but my favorite cinematic discovery has been Le Cinéma Club -- a streaming platform that presents a single, free-to-access movie weekly. By subscribing to the service, every Friday you'll have a curated movie delivered to your digital doorstep. 
Whether you're presented with a stop-motion tale or a French film that you can't find on Netflix or Max, it's a surefire way to encounter stories from outside your typical realm of consumption. Many of the platform's selections are short films, making engagement easier than ever, even with a daunting class schedule or roster of extracurriculars. Taking an hour once a week to enjoy a story you might have otherwise never uncovered might be the kindest thing you do for yourself this January. Even more enticingly, it'll spare you a freezing trek to the theater.

Roblox
Wipe that better-than-thou smirk off of your face - no one is too old for Roblox. I've indulged in my childish whimsy for the past decade through rounds of Natural Disaster Survival or Dress to Impress, and still turned into a mostly well-adjusted adult. Whenever I'm looking for a mindless activity or having a stay-in night with my friends, I browse through Roblox's millions of user-generated games, and they never disappoint. Sometimes it's good to remember that your brain needs a break too, and I've found that the perfect remedy is yelling at players through voice chat in Shrimp Game or traversing through an "obby" - or obstacle course - plastered with whatever pop culture figure is trending at the time. This year, bite the bullet, download the free app on one of your devices and just pick the first game that shows up on your feed. I can guarantee you won't be worried about that class you're still on the waitlist for when you're busy out-dressing a gaggle of 12-year-olds.
- Dani Biondi, Film & TV Editor 
"Kind & Generous" by Natalie Merchant
A key component of self-care - admittedly something I am still working on prioritizing - is practicing self-love. "Kind & Generous" by Natalie Merchant highlights the perpetual importance of showing gratitude to others, but especially to ourselves. This song is written in the second person, and each time Merchant sings, "You've been so kind and generous," it helps me reflect on everyone in my life who supports me. Whether it is our parents, siblings, friends or professors, we all have someone in our life that we can thank for helping us along our journey. As much as it is important to be thankful for others, it is also necessary to thank ourselves. 
While listening to this song, sometimes I switch the perspective and think of myself as the "you." You never "could have come this far without" your own hard work, and you should be thankful for the "generosity / The love and the honesty / That you" can give to yourself. This song's upbeat rhythm is the perfect companion to cheer you on as the semester begins and the work starts to pile up. It is easy to romanticize your life while humming along to Merchant's uplifting lyrics.
