Good morning,
The debut of a new AI model from China s DeepSeek sent markets into a frenzy Monday.
DeepSeek, which released its open-source models for download in the U.S. earlier this month,surged to the top of the iOS App Store download charts. It s been compared favorably to products from OpenAI and Meta, while appearing to be more efficient and cost-effective.
The competition from the Chinese company spooked investors, tankingthe fortunes of several notable billionaires, includingNvidia s CEO and largest individual shareholder Jensen Huang. Huang s net worth fell $20.8 billion by market close, and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison lost $27.6 billion, falling from the third-richest person on Earth to fifth.

SCIENCE + HEALTHCARE
In a memo issued Monday, the acting director of the National Institutes of Healthreiterated that the Department of Health and Human Services has  issued a pause on communications and public appearances by agency staff.

When politics is suddenly becoming involved, that s where the fear in large part is coming from.

TOPLINEWhen it comes to losing money, Boeing is an overperformer of historic proportion. On Thursday, the beleaguered plane maker pre-announced a net loss of $5.46 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, which pencils out to about $3.8 billion. That sa stunning $11.8 billion loss for the year, the second largest in Boeing history.
The lousy news is partly due to the disruption ofa seven-week strike by Boeing s machinists that halted productionof the company s bestselling plane, the 737 Max. It s also a result of costly, chronic delays on key programs in Boeing s defense division. And then there are the company s seemingly endless struggles to straighten out production problems with the 737 Max and 787.
Boeing s financial losing streak now stretches six years, starting with the grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 following two deadly crashes. Its total losses since that time:a staggering $35.7 billion.
Despite Boeing s dismal run, institutional investors have been willing to shore up the company s finances thanks to the company s fat order book of 5,595 planes, which should convert into billions in revenue if new CEO Kelly Ortberg can get its production lines humming smoothly again. The company raised $24 billion late last year through a sale of stock and convertible debt.
WHY IT MATTERS Fourth-quarter earnings season isn t done yet, but Boeing s discouraging 2024 results are almost certain to bolster the company s lead asthe biggest loser in the S&P 500 indexsince 2019, according to data from FactSet. Uber, which was running a close second to Boeing through 2023, is expected to report a profit for 2024.

11.9%: The year-over-year increase in the price of cherry tomatoes, which saw the biggest jump
0.7% to 5.1%:The decline in prices for nacho cheese dip, salsa, tortilla chips and potato chips from 2024
STRATEGY + SUCCESS
Manyorganizations struggle with company culture, even as it remains critically important: Employeeswho feel connected to their organization are four times more likely to be engaged at work, research shows. Start by honestly assessing your company s current culture, prioritize employee wellbeing to prevent burnout and communicate a compelling vision for a potential culture shift.
