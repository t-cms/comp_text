The following information was released by the office of Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw:
Congressman DanCrenshaw (TX-02)reintroduced legislation aimed at cutting off federal funding to universities that require Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) statements as a condition of admission, employment, or advancement.
"We saw an alarming rise in anti-Semitismstarting on October 7, 2023, with a wave of hate spreading across college campuses,"said Congressman Crenshaw. "President Trump has made it clear that we must take decisive action to combat the radicalization happening in our institutions. Now, things are beginning to change, and this legislation builds on his leadership, ensuring that taxpayer dollars do not fund universities that impose ideological purity tests on students and faculty."
How the Bill Works
This legislationamends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit institutions of higher education from requiring ideological statements as part of their admissions, hiring, or contracting processes. Specifically, it ensures that:
Universities cannot force students, faculty, or employees to endorse DEI-related ideologies or submit statements on race, color, ethnicity, or political views as a prerequisite for participation.
No institution receiving federal funds can require applicants to affirm or support race-based ideologies or DEI-related topics as a condition for admission or employment.
Universities cannot provide preferential treatment based on unsolicited support for DEI-related ideologies.
The bill also includes protections for academic freedom, clarifying that it does not restrict coursework, research, or lawful non-discrimination policies.
Background: Building on Conservative Success in Texas
This bill builds on conservativeefforts in Texas, where state lawmakers successfully passed legislation restricting DEI policies in public universities. Crenshaw's proposal elevates this effort to the national level, ensuring that all federally funded institutions follow the same principles of academic freedom and merit-based admissions.
Additionally, the bill provides clear guidelines for enforcement, preventing universities from circumventing these protections while ensuring that federal tax dollars do not subsidize ideological gatekeeping.
