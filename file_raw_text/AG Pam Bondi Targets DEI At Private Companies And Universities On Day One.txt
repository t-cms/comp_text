Key Facts
Bondi s memo told the Justice Department to enforce federal civil rights laws to urge private companies to abandon what she called  illegal discrimination and preferences,  outlining strategies like launching criminal and civil investigations or submitting amicus briefs.
Bondi did not specify what civil rights legislation the department would use, but some conservative activists have used the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which outlawed racial discrimination in making and enforcing contracts, tofightDEI programs in court, andJames Comer, R-Ky., has advocated for using Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race-based employment discrimination.
She also directed the Justice Department to work with the Department of Education to eliminate DEI programs at universities that receive federal funding, citing the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard Supreme Court case, which ended affirmative action in admissions.
Bondi s memo noted she is not calling for the cancellation of cultural observances like Black History Month or International Holocaust Remembrance Day, stating these events  celebrate diversity, recognize historical contributions, and promote awareness without engaging in exclusion or discrimination. 
In anothermemoissued Wednesday, Bondi ordered the department to end  identity-based considerations in employment,  eliminate DEI programs and identify whether DEI programs were  misleadingly relabeled" after the election to preserve their previous function.
Key Background
In both memos, Bondi cited Trump sexecutive orderthat directed federal agencies to end DEI practices and target DEI in the private sector. Trump has framed his anti-DEI crusade part of a wider political backlash against diversity programs as a return to  merit-based  hiring, and he has attacked DEI as discriminatory. As part of the push, Trump also revoked a decades-old Equal Employment Opportunity executive order issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which banned federal contractors from discriminating in hiring based on race, sex, national origin or religion. Trump s orders have led to a purge of federal employees, with dozens of staffers that didn t work in DEIreportedlyamong those placed on leave. As part of the crackdown, federal agenciesremoved webpagesand references to diversity, equity and inclusion but this caused some pages to be erroneously removed, including at theInternal Revenue Service, which mistakenly removed pages unrelated to DEI from an employee handbook. Trump has also linked DEI, without evidence, to the fatal plane and helicoptercollisionnear Washington, D.C., claiming diversity hiring  could have  spurred the crash.
Have Private Companies Cut Dei Programs?
Many companieshave rolled back their programs advancing diversity and inclusion in recent months, particularly since Trump s election victory.Google announcedWednesday it would no longer use diversity targets in hiring and would evaluate its other DEI initiatives, though it will continue to have resource groups for staff from underrepresented groups. Other companies, including Target, Amazon, Meta and McDonald s also said they would roll back DEI programs. But other companies have stood behind their DEI policies, including Costco, which overwhelmingly rejected a shareholder proposal that would have required the company to evaluate the risks of its DEI programs. Apple s board also urged shareholders to reject a similar resolution, while Delta Airlines, Cisco, Deutsche Bank and the NFL have also reaffirmed their commitments to DEI.
