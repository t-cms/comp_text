Donald Trump has arrived at Washington DC’s Capital One arena where he will soon begin signing pardons for Jan 6 rioters.
“We’ll be signing pardons for a lot of people, a lot of people,” he told supporters.
Executive orders are normally signed in more official surroundings like the Oval Office, but the US president is keen to demonstrate that he is delivering for his supporters after his sweeping victory in November’s election.
In a speech at the arena, he also announced plans to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, end government “censorship”, freeze the hiring of federal employees, and revoke dozens of actions by the Biden administration.
A desk embossed with the presidential seal had been set up on stage ready for Mr Trump with a stack of papers to sign while he had a three-course lunch with members of Congress.

“They’ll all be null and void within about what five minutes-is that them over there?
“And next to gain immediate control of the vast federal out of control bureaucracy, I will implement an immediate regulation freeze which will stop Biden bureaucrats from continuing to regulate.
“Most of those bureaucrats they’re being fired. They’re gone.”
“I’ll also issue a temporary hiring freeze to ensure that we’re only hiring competent people who are faithful to the American public,” Mr Trump says, adding to he will require federal workers to return to working from the office.

Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, is speaking about the administration’s diplomatic approach and will soon introduce the US President.
“We are done carrying the financial burden for nations that are unwilling to fund their own progress,” he says, adding: “The days of blank cheques are over.”
The line gets a loud reaction from the crowd, which has been fairly subdued throughout his speech.
Mr Witkoff says he wants to “expand” the Abraham Peace Accords, which normalised relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in the first Trump administration.
He introduces families of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas in the Oct 7 attack onto the stage, where they shake hands with Mr Trump and are applauded by the crowd.

Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator, has criticised Joe Biden for taking a “jab” at Donald Trump by issuing pre-emptive pardons shortly before leaving office.
“It’s political theatre, kind of a jab at Trump. It’s just kind of a sour note in a sad song,” Mr Graham, an ally of Mr Trump’s in the Senate, told NBC News.
It’s his right to do it I guess but it just reinforced a narrative that needs to stop. 
“And I think his last act out the door is not going to be remembered fondly.”

The monarch, who met Mr Trump during the US State Visit to the UK in 2019, is understood to have reflected on the enduring special relationship between the UK and US. The incoming President is known to be an admirer of the Royal family, calling the late Queen Elizabeth II “extraordinary” and Prince William a “good looking guy” after they met in Paris at the end of last year. The Royal family are widely expected to be asked to host or travel for a State Visit, under the Trump presidency, to shore up the warm relationship between the two countries as part of their “soft power” role. No plans for either an inbound or outbound trip have been made, although such a visit has been mooted for the 250th anniversary of American independence next year with the Prince of Wales considered the right person to lead the British delegation if the King is unable to travel due to ill health or commitments at home.20 Jan 2025-04:28PM GMTPictured: Former presidents greet each other20 Jan 2025-04:25PM GMTWatch: Tech bros take their seats20 Jan 2025-04:24PM GMTDonald Trump and JD Vance joined by their familiesFollowing the former presidents and first ladies, members of Donald Trump and JD Vance’s families have filed into the rotunda.Among them were JD Vance’s mother, Bev Vance, who the vice president-elect wrote about in his autobiography, Hillbilly Elegy, and Melania Trump’s father Viktor Knavs.They were joined by Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, who took his place next to Bill Clinton.20 Jan 2025-04:15PM GMTWatch: George Bush arrives at the ceremony20 Jan 2025-04:12PM GMTHillary Clinton greeted with jeers of ‘lock her up’ from Trump supporters outsideThe jeers just escalate in volume with each arrival in the rotunda.

If King had not been assassinated in 1968 and had lived to the present, it seems likely that at the age of 96 he would be a partisan Democrat, like most black American leaders of older generations. But whatever King himself might have thought of Donald Trump and today’s Republicans, America has moved sharply toward King’s vision of a society in which racial differences have faded.

DOGE is expected to send envoys into government departments to begin hunting for cuts as soon as Mr Trump takes office. It will be established by executive order later today.20 Jan 2025-04:00PM GMTCrowds break into cheers at Washington stadium screening inaugurationI timed the first big cheer inside the Capital One Arena at 9.20am when the crowd got its first glimpse of Donald Trump on the huge screens suspended from the centre of the stadium. Mike Kohler, 55, wearing an outsized Make America Great Again hat that reminded me of Super Mario the video game character, shouted ‘Fight Fight Fight’ at the sight of his hero.A former navy captain and now a county commissioner in Pensacola Florida, Mr Kohler said” this is going to be just beautiful and huge. He is going to bring back the American spirit. His is the greatest comeback in my lifetime.” He is expecting a booming economy and tightened borders. “All the stuff about Canada and Greenland is just goofy. But that’s why people love him. He does what he says,” adds Mr Kohler before pulling from his pocket a crumpled cheque from the Trump camp for security work he did with the campaign. His crazy hat gets a lot of likes. “ Donald Trump gave it to me,” Me Kohler told a woman in the crowd. The woman replied: “you’re talking a sack of s**t.”20 Jan 2025-03:58PM GMTForeign dignitaries arrive for the inauguration ceremony20 Jan 2025-03:56PM GMTDonald Trump and Joe Biden arrive at CapitolDonald Trump and President Joe Biden have arrived at the Capitol rotunda for the president-elect’s inauguration.They filed into the ceremonial room where they faced an eclectic line-up of guests, including Gianni Infantino, the head of Fifa, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and media baron Rupert Murdoch.Foreign dignitaries attending included Giorgia Meloni, the leader of Italy, and Javier Milei, the Argentine president.Mr Trump and Mr Biden were followed into the room by mr Trump’s new appointees, including Pete Hegseth, his pick for defence secretary, and Susie Wiles, his chief of staff.20 Jan 2025-03:49PM GMTPictured: Senator John Fetterman braves-4C temperatures in shorts20 Jan 2025-03:47PM GMTPictured: The view from Trump’s post-inauguration rallyThis promises to be quite the show. Thousands inside the Capital One Arena will be forced to watch the inauguration on the big screens but at 3pm Donald Trump will turn up offering his fanatical supporters a ringside view they would not have got had the weather not intervened and brought the whole shebang inside.On the stage to the left a leather chair and desk have been installed-incongruous in a stadium that normally hosts ice hockey and basketball games and rock concerts.We are told Donald Trump will at some point in the post inauguration after-party, which is being staged, start signing executive orders in front of the crowd.What those executive orders will be who knows. But one possibility is this could be pardons for January 6 rioters jailed for invading the Capitol four years ago.If Mr Trump goes down that route it’s going to cause one hell of a stir. The crowd here will (largely) love it and his detractors will be truly wound up.20 Jan 2025-03:42PM GMTPictured: Boris Johnson arrives at the Capitol20 Jan 2025-03:40PM GMTTrump and Biden leave for the CapitolDonald Trump and President Joe Biden have descended the steps of the White House and entered a black limousine which will whisk them away the Capitol for the president-elect’s swearing in ceremony.The first lady, Jill Biden, and incoming first lady Melania Trump, were earlier seen entering a limousine of their own to make the same journey.The journey will mark Mr Biden’s last ride as president, and he is expected to take a helicopter to depart the ceremony later alongside vice president Kamala Harris.Mr Trump and Mr Biden are set to arrive at the Capitol in the next few minutes.20 Jan 2025-03:36PM GMTGuests take their seats in the Capitol Rotunda for the inauguration ceremonyDignitaries, politicians and tech bros have been seen filing into the Capitol to take their seats in the rotunda for Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony.Former vice president Mike Pence, who has a frosty relationship with Mr Trump, has confirmed he is attending, as is Barack Obama, the former president. He will face the fanfare alone, however, as his wife, Michelle Obama, previously announced that she would be skipping the occasion.Other eminent figures seen arriving at the Capitol included Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, former Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the chairman of the Join Chiefs of Staff, CQ Brown.Other less traditional additions to the guest list include tech billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighter and social media personality Connor McGregor has also been slated to make an appearance.20 Jan 2025-03:27PM GMTTrump displeased by last-ditch Biden pardonsDonald Trump is reportedly displeased by Joe Biden’s decision to issue a string of presidential pardons with just hours left of his presidency.Mr Trump is considering discussing the matter at some point today, a source told The New York Times, but it is not clear if he will raise it directly with the incumbent president. The pair are currently meeting each other for tea before travelling to the Capitol together.Mr Trump reportedly told NBC that Mr Biden’s pardons were disgraceful, although it was not clear whether the president-elect was referring to the outgoing president’s latest wielding of his power.20 Jan 2025-03:20PM GMTCrowds stand in line through the night to get a good spot for the televised ceremonyThe doors for the Capital One Arena opened at 8am allowing a little blast of warmth for the tens of thousands trying to get in.Many of them had stood in line through the night for the chance to watch the inauguration on a giant screen normally reserved for basketball and ice hockey games.Aaron Mahan, 34 and a father of three, had been queuing since 2am in arctic conditions and was finally warming up with a carton of fries and three chicken pieces that had cost him $20 from the food concession stand inside the arena. Someone will be making a lot of money out of this.Mr Mahan couldn’t understand the logic of cancelling the event outdoors on the Mall to swap it for one that required him to stand for hours in the middle of the night to secure a ticket.“More than 200,000 people got tickets for the inauguration but there’s only 20,000 seats in here so I figured we need to get here super early,” said Mr Mahan. “It was absolutely freezing cold.” He couldn’t help but wonder if the event would have been safer to have been staged outside.An insurance risk analyst from Birmingham Alabama he had come 19 and a half hours on the train to reach Washington DC. He had come to Trumps last inauguration in 2016 and he remains fervent fan like everyone in here.“I am in it for the next four years,” he said, “just look at gas prices.

Where Donald Trump spent his final night as president-electDonald Trump spent his final night before returning to the White House at the nearby property of Blair House.Built as a private home in 1824, Blair House is opposite the White House and has accommodated presidential guests since being acquired by the US government in 1942.From the outside, it looks like an opulent town house, but in fact, it is four buildings and at 70,000 square feet it is larger than the White House.With 14 bedrooms and 35 bathrooms, there is plenty of room for distinguished guests, it has plenty of accommodation to house the US president’s guests.The original building was more modest, a two-story Federal-style building. But over the years, it has undergone a series of improvements.Named after its second owner, newspaper owner Francis Preston Blair, the building has a remarkable history.It was there that Robert E. Lee declined Abraham Lincoln’s request to lead the Union Army in 1861.Its biggest claim to fame-or notoriety-is when two Puerto Rican activists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola attempted to assassinate President Harry Truman on November 1 1950.The president was staying at the house while the White House was being renovated. The two men travelled down from New York. In the ensuing gun battle, Torresola was shot dead as was one of the police officers Leslie Coffelt.Collazo was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to imprisonment by his intended victim, Harry Truman.20 Jan 2025-02:37PM GMTBiden issues farewell message20 Jan 2025-02:37PM GMTPutin congratulates Trump ahead of inaugurationRussian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Donald Trump on taking office hours before the inauguration.In his message, Putin said he was open to dialogue with the new US administration on Ukraine and nuclear arms.Putin, who said he wanted to secure long-lasting peace in Ukraine rather than a short ceasefire, made the comments during a meeting of Russia’s Security Council.20 Jan 2025-02:28PM GMTWatch: Trump tells supporters to ‘never ever, ever give up’ in new videoDonald Trump’s team have released a video telling his supporters to “never, ever, ever give up”.Mr Trump’s team released the video online on Monday ahead of his swearing-in and it portrays him as an outsider who overcame his legal problems to win a comeback to the White House, ushering in a new chapter for America.The video stitches together footage of his courthouse appearances for his criminal trial last year, his mug shot from another criminal case in Georgia and images of prosecutors and judges involved in some of the other cases he faced, along with images of his visits to UFC matches, his campaign and the Republican National Convention.In a voice-over, Trump tells his supporters to “treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation”.20 Jan 2025-02:15PM GMTAnalysis: Melania Trump’s daring inauguration outfitWe had our first glimpse of Melania Trump’s Inauguration look as she arrived for an early morning church service at St. John’s Episcopal Church, across from the White House, on Monday.The incoming US First Lady wore a navy tailored coat by US designer Adam Lippes under which a crisp white shawl collar could be glimpsed at the neckline. Her navy boater-style hat by Eric Javits featured a white band, and the look was completed by ultra-high navy suede court shoes and a pair of black leather gloves.Bare legs aside, it was a look that reflected the weather in Washington DC-a chilly-6 degrees centigrade, which has forced officials to stage the inauguration indoors for the first time since 1985.It’s a look which bears a likeness to one she wore in 2019 during a state visit to the UK. For a visit to Buckingham Palace to meet the late Queen, she wore a white Dolce & Gabbana dress with a white boater-style hat by her stylist Herve Pierre, trimmed with a black ribbon.In fact, it’s a look which bears similarities with the British royal style playbook. A tailored coat, elegant millinery and sky-high courts are a failsafe fashion formula for the Princess of Wales, Duchess of Edinburgh et al. For a ceremonial occasion such as this, it’s a reliable one from which to borrow.20 Jan 2025-02:05PM GMTWatch: Moment Trump arrives for church service20 Jan 2025-02:01PM GMTWhat to expect in Donald Trump’s inaugural addressDonald Trump’s inauguration speech today will be an attempt to bring the country together after one of the most divisive elections in recent memory.Unlike his first speech as president in 2017, when he described scenes of “American carnage”, today’s address will strike an optimistic note about “courage, vigour and the vitality of history’s greatest civilisation”. He will also herald a “thrilling new era of national success”, in a more self-assured speech that carries the weight of a former president returning to power.It is the first hint of how Mr Trump will try to redefine his image over the next four years. He has told allies he wants to go down in history as one of America’s great presidents, and believes projecting a message of national unity is one way to achieve that.After his first election win, we saw an angry and triumphant Mr Trump, who pledged to wage war on his enemies and the Washington establishment. His plans this time are much the same  but the tone of his speech will be quite different. 20 Jan 2025-01:53PM GMTPictured: Donald Trump arrives for morning mass20 Jan 2025-01:46PM GMTDonald Trump arrives at churchDonald Trump has arrived at St John’s Episcopal Church for this morning’s non-partisan prayer service.The president-elect’s motorcade departed Blair House a short while ago, with members of Mr Trump’s family taking their places before the arrival of the soon-to-be president.After the service, Mr Trump and his wife Melania will be greeted at the executive mansion by Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea.20 Jan 2025-01:43PM GMTWashington teeming with military vehicles in security lockdownThe freezing streets of Washington are teeming with National Guard troops and military vehicles this morning, in a visible demonstration of the immense security operation that surrounds today’s events.A few Trump supporters  wearing their trademark red baseball caps  are wandering around the secure zones at the Capitol and White House with hours to go before the schedule kicks off.Some fans have been queuing since 3am to get into the Capital One arena, where the inauguration ceremony will be livestreamed, but many who travelled from across the nation will be disappointed. The arena holds 20,000 people and hundreds of thousands were expected to line the National Mall to watch the now-cancelled outdoor swearing-in.A tourist shop inside the closest Metro station to the White House has been repurposed as an inauguration merchandise stand, selling t-shirts and hats with today’s date and photographs of the president-elect.Anyone celebrating outdoors will be battling the cold. It is currently-6C and set to stay well below freezing all day.20 Jan 2025-01:41PM GMTPictured: Trump’s family arrive for morning church ceremony20 Jan 2025-01:34PM GMTInauguration crowds brace for freezing temperaturesCrowds gathering for today’s inauguration are braced for freezing weather, with temperatures set dip to minus 7C and winds reaching 30mph.Icy conditions, caused by an arctic blast buffeting the country’s east, forced the inaugural ceremony to be moved indoors to the Capitol’s Rotunda. It will be the first time the president hasn’t taken the inaugural oath in public view since Ronald Regan was sworn into office in 1985.20 Jan 2025-01:19PM GMT‘We are on the eve of an authoritarian administration,’ says Alexandria Ocasio-CortezDemocratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez launched a tirade against Donald Trump last night, warning the nation is on the “eve of an authoritarian administration”.“We are on the eve of an authoritarian administration,” the The New York representative and Left-wing firebrand said the day before Mr Trump returns to office. “This is what 21st century fascism is starting to look like.”Ms Ocasio-Cortez also questioned why TikTok had credited Mr Trump for bringing back the video sharing app, accusing the Chinese platform of being a “propaganda tool for the right”. “They are signalling that they are privately collaborating, they have agreed to privately collaborate with Donald Trump and the Trump administration,” she said.Mr Trump has said he will sign an executive order to reinstate TikTok after the app briefly went dark on Saturday night. TikTok was banned owing to security concerns about the app having access to personal data of millions of Americans. Mr Trump’s executive order is likely to extend the deadline given to ByteDance, its parent company, to find a suitable buyer for the app.20 Jan 2025-01:07PM GMTBiden issues last-minute pardons to protect against Trump ‘revenge’President Joe Biden has issued a series of preemptive pardons on his final morning in office to protect against “revenge” meted about by Donald Trump.Mr Biden cited “exceptional circumstances” as he pardoned Dr Anthony Fauci, who led the country’s Covid-19 response, retired Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who criticised Mr Trump for his actions on January 6 2021, and members of the House committee that investigated Mr Trump over the attacks on the Capitol from four years ago. “The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,” Mr Biden said in a statement. “Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.“These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,” the President continued, adding that “Even when individuals have done nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”Mr Biden’s last-ditch actions come after Mr Trump has repeatedly warned of an enemies list of those who have crossed him whom he has pledged to punish in his second term.20 Jan 2025-12:39PM GMTWhat Europe thinks of a new Trump administrationAs Donald Trump takes the oath in Washington, most European leaders, even as they clamour to congratulate the new president, will be anxiously buckling up for a bumpy four years.A Kamala Harris victory would have been a win for the status quo but instead Europe is bracing for a second Trump term that threatens to be every bit as tumultuous and combustible as his first.There is uncertainty over the unpredictable Mr Trump’s plans to end the war in Ukraine. He expects Europe to pay much more for its own, and Ukraine’s, defence, and reportedly wants European armies to police a demilitarised zone in post-ceasefire Ukraine.There are concerns over the possible consequences for Europe if he pursues a trade war with China. Europe is also in Mr Trump’s tariff crosshairs because he believes countries like Germany have got rich off trade surpluses with the US.Mr Trump’s plans for the Middle East, Iran and international agreements on issues such as climate change will weigh on European minds, as old world governments struggle to stay relevant as the US tilt to the Indo-Pacific intensifies.European leaders, including Keir Starmer, have been discussing how to tame Trump, who diplomatic sources stress is a “transactional” leader who can be negotiated with. They have been echoing Trump’s talking points on defence spending, while warning Russia won’t negotiate peace in Ukraine if Washington cuts off arms supplies to Kyiv.Not all leaders regard a Trump presidency with dread. Hungary’s nationalist leader Viktor Orban is overjoyed. Meanwhile Italy’s hard Right Prime Minister Georgia Meloni, who is attending the inauguration, is expected to be Europe’s “Trump-whisperer”, thanks to her friendship with Mr Trump and Elon Musk.20 Jan 2025-12:37PM GMTKey timings for the inaugurationDonald Trump is set to be sworn in as the 47th US president at 12 midday ET (5pm GMT) today in a pared back ceremony inside the Capitol’s rotunda.According to a former secret service agent who spoke to The Telegraph, the day’s schedule will have been planned to the minute and rehearsed for weeks in advance to ensure the event is secure.Here are the rough timings of what to expect today:8am: Mr Trump will attend a ceremony at St John’s Episcopal Church, before he and his wife, Melania, head to the White House for tea with President Joe Biden and the First Lady, Jill Biden.

                     Pope calls Trump’s border plans a ‘disgrace’                   
 Pope Francis has slammed Donald Trump’s plan to deport thousands of immigrants as a “disgrace.”
The pontiff’s comments came in a response to a question about Mr Trump’s plans to remove undocumented migrants by implementing executive orders when he is sworn into office.
“If it is true, it will be a disgrace, because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing to pay the unpaid bill. It won’t do. This is not the way to solve things,” the leader of the Catholic church told Italian television.
The 88-year-old has long championed the rights of migrants as part of his papal advocacy, pushing for them to be accepted.
Mr Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest deportation operation in American history”, starting from his first day in office.

                     Trump to call for ‘revolution of common sense’ in inaugural address                   
Donald Trump will reportedly use his inaugural address to call for a “revolution of common sense” when he is sworn into office at noon ET (5pm GMT) today.
“I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country,” the president-elect is due to say, according to The Wall Street Journal. “My message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigour and the vitality of history’s greatest civilisation.”
The soon-to-be president’s comments appear to strike a more optimistic tone than his 2017 inaugural address, when he lamented “American carnage”.
It comes as Mr Trump vowed at a victory rally in Washington DC yesterday to implement a slew of executive orders on his first day in office.

                     What happened at the pre-inauguration rally?                   
Donald Trump last night   at a packed Capital One Arena in Washington DC.
Thousands of supporters-as well as MAGA world luminaries-attended as the soon-to-be president gave a rousing speech promising to act with “historic speed” to “fix every single crisis facing our country”.
Putting illegal immigration front and centre of his agenda, he vowed that “by the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will have come to a halt”.
After closing with a familiar promise to “make America great again”, he stepped back from the microphone and was joined on stage by The Village People.
As “YMCA” rang out across the arena, Mr Trump swayed his hips from side to side while punching the air at shoulder height.

                     TikTok thanks Trump as US service restarts                   
TikTok thanked Donald Trump as it began restoring services in the US on Sunday, after the incoming president said he would revive access to the app when he takes office later today.
In a message to users on Sunday, TikTok said: “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.”
The China-based app stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect a day later.
Mr Trump said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office. “Frankly, we have no choice.  ,” he told a pre-inauguration rally on Sunday
The incoming US president has said he would like the US “to have a 50% ownership position” in the app.
China’s foreign ministry said on Monday companies should “decide independently” after Mr Trump’s suggestion was put to a spokesman.

                     The coldest inauguration since 1985                   
Donald Trump’s second inauguration is set be the coldest since 1985, when Ronald Reagan was sworn in for his second term.
Temperatures are expected to peak at around-3C due to a plunge of Arctic air that that has swept down the US from Canada.
The inauguration address and the ceremony at the US Capitol rotunda will be moved indoors due to the extreme weather, Mr Trump announced on Friday.
Washington’s Capital One Arena will be open for crowds to watch the swearing-in, and Trump said he would stop by the arena after the ceremony.
