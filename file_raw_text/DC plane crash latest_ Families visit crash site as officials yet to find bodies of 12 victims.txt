Vice President J.D. Vance defended President Donald Trump's remarks.
"The president made very clear that he wasn't blaming anybody, but he was being very explicit about the fact that DEI policies have led our air traffic controllers to be short-staffed," Vance told Fox News on Sunday. "That is a scandal. Thankfully, it's a scandal that the president has stopped."
All 67 people on both aircraft are believed to be dead, and the cause of the collision is still under investigation.
When asked why he was now blaming efforts to recruit people with disabilities during a White House press conference, Trump replied: "Because I have common sense, okay, and unfortunately, a lot of people don't," he said.
Vance said it's important officials "investigate everything" but doubled down on his claims that "DEI policies" may have impacted air traffic control.
"Let's just say the person at the controls didn't have enough staffing around him or her because we were turning people away because of DEI reasons," Vance said.
"There is a very direct connection between the policies of the last administration and short-staffed air traffic controllers," he added.

Conflicting information from plane's black boxes
Sunday 2 February 2025 10:06
,
Holly Evans
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board have determined the CRJ700 airplane was at 325 feet (91 meters), plus or minus 25 feet, at the time of impact, officials said at a Saturday evening news briefing.
The information was based on data recovered from the jet's flight data recorder - the "black box" that tracks the aircraft's movements, speed and other parameters.
The new detail suggests the Army helicopter was flying above 200 feet (61 meters), the maximum altitude for the route it was using.  
Preliminary data indicates the control tower's radar showed the helicopter at 200 feet at the time of the accident, though officials said the information has not been confirmed.
"That's what our job is, to figure that out," NTSB board member Todd Inman told reporters when asked what could explain the discrepancy.

Duffy said the FAA "activated its contingency system to supplement and support preflight briefings and continue flight operations... We are investigating the root cause and we will provide updates."

Black Hawk helicopter was on a 'continuity of government' training flight

Holly Evans
The Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet in Washington on Wednesday was on a training flight along a route core to a seldom-discussed military mission to evacuate senior officials to safety in the event of an attack on the U.S., officials say.
The military mission, known as "continuity of government" and "continuity of operations," is meant to preserve the ability of the U.S. government to operate.
Most days, crews like the one killed on Wednesday transport VIPs around Washington, which is buzzing with helicopter traffic.
But U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth disclosed the Black Hawk crew's ties to the mission during a White House press conference on Thursday, saying they "were on a routine, annual re-training of night flights on a standard corridor for a continuity of government mission."
Still, little of such missions is publicly discussed.
The three soldiers killed in the collision were part of the 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, whose responsibilities in a national crisis include evacuating Pentagon officials. Another 64 people were killed in the passenger plane.
