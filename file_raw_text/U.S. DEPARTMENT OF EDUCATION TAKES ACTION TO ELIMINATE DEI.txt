The following information was released by the U.S. Department of Education:
The U.S. Department of Education has taken action to eliminate harmful Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, including references to them in public-facing communication channels and its associated workforce. These actions are in line with President Trump's ongoing commitment to end illegal discrimination and wasteful spending across the federal government. They are the first step in reorienting the agency toward prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in our schools.
Following President Trump's recent Executive Orders and initial guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Department removed or archived hundreds of guidance documents, reports, and training materials that include mentions of DEI from its outward facing communication channels. The Department also put employees charged with leading DEI initiatives on paid administrative leave. These review efforts will continue as the Department works to end discrimination based on race and the use of harmful race stereotypes, both within the agency and throughout America's education system.
Notable actions the Department has taken include:
Dissolution of the Department's Diversity and Inclusion Council, effective immediately;
Background:The Diversity and Inclusion Council was established following Executive Order 13583 under then - President Obama. President Trump has rescinded the Executive Orders that guide the Council and issued a new Executive Order, "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing," that terminates groups like the Diversity and Inclusion Council. DEI documents issued and related actions taken by the Council have been withdrawn.
Dissolution of the Employee Engagement Diversity Equity Inclusion Accessibility Council (EEDIAC) within the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), effective immediately and pursuant to President Trump's Executive Order "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing";
Cancellation of ongoing DEI training and service contracts which total over $2.6 million;
Withdrawal of the Department's Equity Action Plan;
Placement of career Department staff tasked with implementing the previous administration's DEI initiatives on paid administrative leave; and
Identification for removal of over 200 web pages from the Department's website that housed DEI resources and encouraged schools and institutions of higher education to promote or endorse harmful ideological programs.
Pursuant to OPM guidance, the Department will continue its comprehensive review of all agency programs and services to identify additional initiatives and working groups that may be advancing a divisive DEI agenda, including programs using coded or imprecise language to disguise their activity. Careful review of all public sites and media channels for DEI language and resources will also continue.
