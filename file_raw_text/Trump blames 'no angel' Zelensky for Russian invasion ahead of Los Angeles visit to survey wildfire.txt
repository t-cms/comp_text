The president's aides and staffers have been strongly advised not to socialize with lawmakers in Washington, according to a report.
Staffers within the White House legislative affairs office, particularly in external-facing roles, have been "strongly discouraged" from consuming alcohol with members of Congress, according to Politico's West Wing Playbook.
"We strongly urged everyone in the legislative affairs office and everyone who's externally facing to be thoughtful about their alcohol use in public, and specifically with members," a source told the outlet. 
"We strongly discouraged drinking with members."
"It's a free country, but we represent the White House and the president and that's best done sober," a second source added.

Trump to hire Big Pharma lobbyist in apparent rebuke of RFK Jr
12:55
,
Joe Sommerlad
The president is reportedly set to appoint a prominent healthcare industry lobbyist to his new administration in a move that could potentially tee up a power struggle with Robert F Kennedy Jr, his controversial nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
According to The Financial Times, the new president has Don Dempsey in mind to be his top health official at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Dempsey is the current head of policy and research at Better Medicare Alliance, a lobby group that advocates for an alternative to the federal Medicare program and that is funded by insurance companies, including UnitedHealth and Humana.
Should he be offered the position of the OMB's health program associate director and accept it, Dempsey would hold sway over the US's $1.8trn healthcare budget and have responsibility for 13 separate divisions and agencies, a prospect seemingly at odds with Trump's promise to Kennedy that he would be free to run "wild" across government with his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda.


'Putin is ready,' Russia tells Trump

Joe Sommerlad
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has responded to the president's Truth Social challenge to his Russian counterpart on Wednesday and his remarks yesterday to the World Economic Forum and to Sean Hannity regarding the Ukraine war by saying "Putin is ready" to discuss its endgame with the new American administration.
Russia is simply "waiting for signals" from the Trump administration, Peskov added, according to AFP, but declined to offer a timeline on talks, saying it was "hard to read coffee the grounds" [i.e. predict the future].
The spokesman also rejected Trump's claim to the Davos crowd that the war in Ukraine was tied to high oil prices (the president said he would ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to lower oil prices because "if the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately").
Peskov insisted the "conflict does not depend on oil prices" and was rather about "threats to Russia's national security", "threats to Russians" living in Ukraine and "the lack of desire and complete refusal of Americans and Europeans to listen to Russia's concerns".

Joe Sommerlad
Government employers have been warned they may face "consequences" if they fail to identify colleagues who have been hired through diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) schemes.
Emails sent to government employees and first obtained by NBC News accuse staffers of hiding information about those on the schemes by using "coded or imprecise language".
As of Wednesday, employees had been given 10 days to report colleagues on DEI schemes that had gone unnoticed by government supervisors.
"We are aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language," the emails said.
Employees were directed to notify the Office of Personnel Management if they are "aware of a change in any contract description or personnel position description since November 5 2024 to obscure the connection between the contract and DEI or similar ideologies".

The president and first lady "mean to make as much money as they can" during their second stint in the White House, ethics watchdogs and experts have warned.
In the days before Trump took office, the couple launched meme coins that triggered a record-breaking crypto rally, which in turn saw the market surge by more than half a trillion dollars over the last week.
Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the liberal group Public Citizen, has since said that the second Trump administration likely won't even pay "lip service" to the ethics guardrails that were in place during his first term.
"This time, it feels like the gloves are off, and they have no intention of comporting themselves with the decorum and ethical standards of other administrations," Gilbert said.
"They truly mean to make as much as they can on the backs of the American taxpayer."

Murkowski put out a statement right before the Senate voted to invoke cloture on Hegseth's confirmation, which would begin 30 hours of consideration for his confirmation. 
Republicans hope to confirm Hegseth either today or Saturday.
In a lengthy statement posted on X, Murkowski explained why she would not vote to confirm him, saying she watched his confirmation hearing closely and heard feedback from constituents.
"After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense," she said.
"I did not make this decision lightly; I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent with the utmost seriousness."

Trump could be sending as many as 10,000 troops to the Mexican border

As many as 10,000 troops could eventually be stationed at the US-Mexico border as part of Trump's sweeping campaign to carry out mass deportations and declare a national emergency at the international boundary line.
Though the operation will initially involve about 1,500 additional troops joining the roughly 2,500 already at the border, the total force could swell to 10,000 people, the Pentagon told reporters on Wednesday.
"This is just the beginning," acting defense secretary Robert Salesses said in a statement.
The troops will not carry out direct immigration and border enforcement like making arrests and seizing drugs, but will reportedly serve other roles including transporting migrants to processing facilities and using military planes to assist the Department of Homeland Security in deporting migrants who are already detained.

Trump pardons 'peaceful' anti-abortion protestors who barricaded door and injured nurse

Joe Sommerlad
The president signed pardons for 23 anti-abortion activists yesterday who were convicted for violating a federal law that makes it a crime to block entrances to reproductive health clinics.
The pardon list includes Lauren Handy, who is serving a nearly five-year prison sentence after forcing her way inside a Washington DC clinic in 2020 and using ropes, bike blocks and chains to stop patients from entering - actions that anti-abortion groups and Republican officials have characterized as peaceful protests unjustly prosecuted by a politically-motivated administration.
Their convictions under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act during Joe Biden's presidency were fiercely condemned by anti-abortion organizations and right-wing legal groups, which pressed Trump for Thursday's pardon.
"This is a great honor to sign this," Trump said from the Oval Office.
"They should not have been prosecuted... Ridiculous."

A federal judge has temporarily blocked Trump's sweeping executive order seeking to unilaterally redefine the 14th Amendment and federal law by denying citizenship to certain American-born children of immigrants.
District Judge John Coughenour, presiding over a lawsuit brought by several states seeking to overturn Trump's order, delivered a blistering criticism of the president's "blatantly unconstitutional" action from the bench in a Seattle courtroom on Thursday.
"I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one is. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order," said the Ronald Reagan appointee.

Donald Trump blamed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia's invasion of his homeland during the second part of his interview with Sean Hannity, which aired on Fox News last night.
The president said Zelensky was "no angel" and had allowed the war to rumble on by, er, putting up a fight but did say he would be prepared to impose massive tariffs on Moscow if Vladimir Putin refused to enter talks on ending the conflict.

Donald Trump said he is unbothered by Elon Musk's criticism of the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project he announced this week, telling reporters that Musk is critical because one of the people involved in the deal is "one of the people he happens to hate."

The president also addressed the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and his pledge that he would stop it within the first 24 hours of his administration, which didn't materialize. He appeared to blame the war's continuance on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Zelensky, he said, is "no angel" and "shouldn't have allowed this war to happen," even though it was Russia that invaded Ukraine.
"First of all, he's fighting a much bigger entity, okay, much bigger. When he was, you know, talking so brave ... Zelensky was fighting a much bigger entity, much bigger, much more powerful. He shouldn't have done that, because we could have made a deal, and it would have been a deal that would have been, it would have been a nothing deal," Trump claimed.

Donald Trump announced Thursday he would pardon anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinic entrances.
The president called it "a great honor to sign this."
"They should not have been prosecuted," he said as he signed pardons for "peaceful pro-life protesters."
Among the people pardoned were those involved in the October 2020 invasion and blockade of a Washington clinic.
In the first week of Trump's presidency, anti-abortion advocates have ramped up calls for Trump to pardon protesters charged with violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which is designed to protect abortion clinics from obstruction and threats. The 1994 law was passed during a time when clinic protests and blockades were on the rise, as well as violence against abortion providers, such as the murder of Dr. David Gunn in 1993.

Wray, who Trump named to lead the bureau in 2017 after he fired then-director James Comey, resigned just before the 45th president was sworn in as the 47th president on Monday. Trump had indicated a desire to fire Wray because the former New Jersey US Attorney had failed to stop criminal investigations into his conduct.

Musk has been skirmishing with Wikipedia for a while - in October 2024 he offered a $1 billion donation to change the site's name to "Dickipedia"- but this latest attack fits into a long and worrying pattern of Musk trying to control what people see and hear about him and his businesses.
"He is the world's leading free speech hypocrite," Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, tells The Independent. "And his actions with respect to Wikipedia are further evidence of that.
