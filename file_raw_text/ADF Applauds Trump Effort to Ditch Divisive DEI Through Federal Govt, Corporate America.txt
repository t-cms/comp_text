The following quote may be attributed to Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel and Senior Vice President for Corporate Engagement Jeremy Tedesco regarding an executive order President Donald Trump issued Tuesday, "Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity:"
"President Trump has delivered on a major promise to the American people. Personnel decisions should be made based on merit--not skin color, sex, or any other protected characteristic.
"That's true of government agencies, federal contractors, and across corporate America as well.
"President Trump's actions require all federal contractors, including many large companies, to certify that they do not operate DEI programs; urge federal agencies to investigate the worst DEI policies and programs in corporate America, higher education, and other settings; and restore merit-based decision-making in personnel decisions for federal government and contractors. Discrimination under the guise of DEI is legally suspect, reputationally risky, and morally unjustified.
"DEI is on its way out. And not a day too soon."
