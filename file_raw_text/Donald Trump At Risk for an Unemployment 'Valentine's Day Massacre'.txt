Highlight: Trump's directive to halt federal grants and loans raises concerns about its impact on the U.S. economy and unemployment rates.
Body


President 's recent directive to , loans and financial assistance has sparked widespread concern about its potential impact on the U.S. economy and unemployment rates. While the administration aims to reassess spending priorities, this move could inadvertently exacerbate .
Why It Matters
As of December 2024, the , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This relatively low rate suggests that the economy is on the path to recovery from previous downturns. Maintaining this momentum is essential to ensure continued job growth and economic stability. Without consistent progress, the risk of backsliding into higher unemployment and economic instability could increase, potentially undoing the gains made in recent years.
Trump recently proposed a freeze on funds allocated to states, research institutions, non-profits and government projects—sectors that collectively employ millions. Interrupting this funding threatens to destabilize these entities, potentially leading to job losses and stalling economic progress.
What To Know
On January 27, Acting Office of Management and Budget Director Matthew J. Vaeth  instructing federal agencies to "temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance..." The memo exempted programs like  and Medicare, but left ambiguity around others, such as Medicaid and educational grants. This lack of clarity led to widespread confusion among states and institutions reliant on federal support.
Experts warn that the timing of the freeze will be critical in assessing its impact on the unemployment rate. Diane Swonk, chief economist for global auditing firm KPMG, told Newsweek that while the funds have been temporarily unfrozen, the key issue is how they will proceed after February 3. Swonk emphasized that furloughs tend to happen quickly, and the current stopgap only lasts until February 3. The impact on the February employment report will depend on whether the freeze resumes after that date.
"What matters for unemployment and the employment report is whether people are working that week or not," Swonk stated. "The risk is for a Valentine's Day massacre, which one would assume most in elected positions would prefer to avoid."
Swonk also pointed out that labor shortages may be exacerbated by immigration policies. "...we could begin to see whether shock and awe raids to deport migrants have spillover chilling effect on who shows up for employment."
The freeze was scheduled to take effect on January 28 at 5 p.m. ET. However, just before the deadline, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan . A hearing is set for February 3 to further assess the legality of the administration's action.
If the freeze is implemented, the repercussions on unemployment could be substantial. Many state and local projects funded by federal grants employ large numbers of workers. Halting these funds could lead to project delays or cancellations, resulting in immediate layoffs and long-term economic setbacks.
Research institutions and non-profits are also at risk. Federal grants often fund critical research and community programs, providing salaries for researchers, educators and support staff. A sudden pause in funding could force organizations to furlough or terminate employees. This could undermine advancements in fields, such as healthcare, technology and social services.
What People Are Saying
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated in a press briefing: "It means no more funding for illegal DEI programs. It means no more funding for the Green New Scam that has cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. It means no more funding for transgenderism and wokeness across our federal bureaucracy and agencies. No more funding for Green New Deal social engineering policies. Again, people who are receiving individual assistance, you will continue to receive that."
Diane Swonk, chief economist for global auditing firm KPMG, told Newsweek: "This is what is key for the February employment report. The funds have been temporarily unfrozen. The largest issue is how will they proceed. Furloughs tend to be rapid, and the current stop gap lasts only until February 3.
The extent to which it shows up in the February employment report will be whether it is allowed to resume after that date. ...What matters for unemployment and the employment report is whether people are working that week or not. The risk is for a Valentines Day massacre, which one would assume most in elected positions would prefer to avoid.
Separately, we could begin to see whether shock and awe raids to deport migrants have spillover chilling effect on who shows up for employment. That will be important in watching payroll employment for February but more as the year progresses.
[Agriculture], construction and leisure and hospitality rely heavily on immigrant labor. However, largest shear numbers are in healthcare and social assistance. Childcare and eldercare [are] most at risk."
Alex Beene, financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: "The chaos of the last 24 hours since President Trump's order to freeze funds from different federal grant-based programs may ultimately turn out to be overblown, but the initial fears it stoked are absolutely valid. Thousands of jobs at federal and state levels are included in the sweeping memo to halt funding, and it's easy to see why many institutions yesterday were swamped with calls from employees worried this could be devastating not just to who they serve, but to themselves and their income, as well.
As of now, the belief is many of these services will remain intact and funding will eventually continue to flow as normal. The administration has said the freeze was more the result of seeing how funding was being used instead of putting a pause on essential services for millions of Americans.
However, it creates an incredible amount of uncertainty at a time when many Americans who are living paycheck-to-paycheck that government services they're receiving could be eliminated, or if they're employed through a federal grant affected, their job could go away. The hope is this gets resolved quickly."
Kevin Thompson, founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek: "The current freeze on federal funds has yet to surprise the markets. In the short term, the administration is offering buyouts to government employees willing to leave, providing seven months of severance pay. This could be beneficial for those at full benefits eligibility who were already planning to retire. However, it may also trigger a wave of retirements, negatively impacting employment in the short term.
Beyond job losses, this move will likely affect government efficiency, creating staffing shortages and operational disruptions in key departments. I expect significant turmoil as agencies struggle to adjust.
I'm particularly interested in how the upcoming jobs data will reflect these shifts. In 2024, the government added an average of 37,000 jobs per month. I anticipate this trend will reverse sharply in 2025, with a significant decline in government employment that could have lasting effects on overall job numbers."
What Happens Next
The temporary block on the funding freeze remains in effect until the February 3 hearing. During this period, federal agencies and recipients of federal funds are in a state of uncertainty, unsure whether to proceed with planned projects and expenditures. The outcome of the hearing will determine the immediate future of numerous programs and the jobs they support.
