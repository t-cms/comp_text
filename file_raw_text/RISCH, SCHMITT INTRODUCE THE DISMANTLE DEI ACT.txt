The following information was released by Idaho Sen. James E. Risch:
U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) introduced theDismantle DEI Act,tocodifyinto lawPresident Trump's executive actions terminating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and initiatives.This bill makes Trump's actions permanent,preventing future administrations from reinstating similar Biden-era DEI policies.
"Woke identity politics have impeded American progress for the last time,"said Risch."President Trump's executive action to end wasteful DEI initiatives will save taxpayer dollars and elevate individuals with the proper merit to make America great again. TheDismantle DEI Actrestores commonsense by ensuring a person's qualifications and hard workare what qualifies them for a position, notdivisiveDEIideology."
"DEI has plagued our federal government, academic institutions, and other aspects of our society for far too long, all while disregarding merit in the process. America is the greatest meritocracy the world has ever seen, and no taxpayer dollars should be wasted on funding this divisive ideology which undercuts the values our country was founded on. President Trump understands that these programs have absolutely no business in the federal government, and I am proud to introduce this critical legislation with Congressman Cloud that will save taxpayer dollars and put a stop to this DEI madness," saidSchmitt.
On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, "Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing." This executive action terminates DEI programs and initiatives throughout all federal departments and agencies, while also compiling a list of those federal contractors and grantees associated with those same programs.President Trump helped reverse many of the Biden administration's priorexecutive actionson DEI programs.
TheDismantle DEI Acthelps build on the President's agenda by:
Ensuring all DEI offices are terminated and prohibiting agencies from renaming or repurposing them to continue the same functions under new titles.
Barring federal funds from being used for DEI training, grants, or programsincluding identity-based quotas and critical race theory.
Granting individuals the legal right to challenge any of these violations in court.
Risch and Schmitt are joined by U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) in introducing this legislation.
