Why it matters: The Trump administration has taken actions that undermine accessibility measures - critical for leveling the playing field for people with disabilities - as part of its efforts targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
"It's very clear that there is an orchestrated attack by conservatives to dismantle the rights of people with disabilities," said Shawn Murinko, a Washington resident who has cerebral palsy.

The federal government is one of the largest employers for people with disabilities, but return-to-office mandates  
Reality check: "Disability is a natural part of the human experience," said Katy Neas, chief executive officer of The Arc, which serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
"All people will probably face disability at some point in their life, whether it's due to illness, injury or age, and disability affects every family, regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, income or political party."

Medicaid covers services that allow people with disabilities to live and work in their own communities rather in institutions or medical facilities. But  
Medicaid-provided home and community services have been vital to Sean Pevsner, a Texas-based civil rights attorney with cerebral palsy. Their support has allowed him to attend college and law school, practice law, and lobby for disability rights, he said.
Threat level: A Republican-led lawsuit challenging a Biden-era policy to treat gender dysphoria as a protected disability has the potential to undermine a 1973 civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability,

This tone is "very hurtful, because people with disabilities have a right to work, and they get their jobs because they're qualified," said Sydney Badeau, a neurodivergent self-advocate in Wisconsin.
The other side: The Trump administration takes issue with lowering standards to achieve diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility goals - not DEIA itself, the White House told Axios.
"President Trump is a leader for all Americans. The Trump-Vance administration values the contributions of government employees with disabilities and believes they should be recognized and rewarded based on the merit of the work," a White House official said in an email.

Eroding support for disabled people "harkens back to the time when people with disabilities were put behind closed doors and not talked about instead of being celebrated and supported," said Nicole Jorwic, advocacy chief at Caring Across Generations, a coalition of caregivers and care recipients.
What's next: Ray Hemachandra, whose son Nicholas is autistic and medically fragile, said he wants more Republican families to join and be welcomed into disability advocacy circles.
"I'm hopeful that we recognize, and that politicians recognize and legislators recognize, that Republicans are as likely to have a family member with intellectual and developmental disabilities as Democrats do," Hemachandran said.
