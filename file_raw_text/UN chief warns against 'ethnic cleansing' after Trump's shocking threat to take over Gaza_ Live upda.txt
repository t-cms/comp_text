How much might Trump's tariffs cost typical U.S. households?
01:30
,
Oliver O'Connell
According to the latest research by the , President Donald Trump's tariff proposals, if fully enacted, would be the largest tax increase in at least a generation (since 1993 or before).
The incoming Trump administration has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on most goods from Canada and Mexico (except Canadian energy, which faces a 10 percent tariff) and a 10 percent increase in tariffs on goods from China. The direct cost of these actions to the typical, or median, US household would be a tax increase of more than $1,200 a year.
The tariffs against Canada and Mexico have been postponed by 30 days to allow for negotiation over what each country and say or do to mollify Trump's concerns about fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration across the northern and southern borders of the U.S.
These announcements mark the first wave of tariffs expected from the new Trump administration. Trump has threatened the entire world with tariffs. Governments abroad will retaliate; both Canada and Mexico have already announced retaliatory measures. Future waves of US tariffs and retaliation will increase these substantial consumer costs alongside the other economic harms of tariffs: reduced economic growth, a shrinking export sector, and supply chain disruption.
While movements in exchange rates or declines in exporter prices could reduce harm to consumers, prior evidence clearly shows that the effects of exchange rates only partially dampen this harm (with any relief coming at the expense of the export sector). A careful analysis of the 2018-19 trade war with China consistently found that foreign exporters to the United States did not lower their prices when faced with U.S. tariffs; instead, U.S. buyers of imports bore the burden of the tax.
There are additional factors to consider. First, domestic producers competing with the newly tariffed imports will raise their prices in accordance with the increases in import prices. This will further burden US consumers, causing their costs to exceed those illustrated in this figure. Overall, higher prices, coupled with recessionary effects from retaliation and supply chain disruptions, will adversely affect most US households.

UN head warns Trump against ethnic cleansing in Gaza

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told President Donald Trump on Wednesday to avoid ethnic cleansing in Gaza after the U.S. leader proposed Palestinians resettle elsewhere and the United States take over the war-torn enclave.
"In the search for solutions, we must not make the problem worse. It is vital to stay true to the bedrock of international law. It is essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing," Guterres told a previously planned meeting of a U.N. committee.
"We must reaffirm the two-state solution," he said.
While Guterres did not mention Trump or his Gaza proposal during his address to the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters earlier that it would be a "fair assumption" to view Guterres' remarks as a response.

The details of the increase in flights will be discussed in working groups to be established, Arevalo said.

Oliver O'Connell
Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board who was fired by Donald Trump, has filed a lawsuit contesting her removal. The president is named alongside Marvin Kaplan, the new chairman of the NLRB. 
This suit sets up an explosive test case about the president's power over independent federal agencies.
The suit alleges that Trump's late-night dismissal of Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve on the board and as its chair, violated the law that permits removing board members only for "neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause."
The law stipulates that removal can only happen after notice and a hearing. The lawsuit argued that Trump's dismissal lacked justification for his action and was carried out without notice or a hearing.
A sitting NLRB board member has never been removed by a president in the agency's 90-year history.
Wilcox's removal leaves the NLRB without the quorum necessary to conduct business enforcing the nation's labor laws.
