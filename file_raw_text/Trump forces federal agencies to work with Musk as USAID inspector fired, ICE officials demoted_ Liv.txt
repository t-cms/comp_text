What is Egypt's response to Trump's plan for Gaza and Palestinians?

Oliver O'Connell
Egypt has rejected any proposal to allocate land to residents of Gaza, state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV reported on Tuesday, citing Egyptian sources.
President Donald Trump mentioned earlier on the same day that he believes there will be parcels of land in Jordan, Egypt, and elsewhere where Palestinians can be resettled.
However, Egypt announced that it plans to offer a "comprehensive proposal" for rebuilding Gaza while ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land, according to a statement from the foreign ministry.
The country also expressed its eagerness to collaborate with Trump to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region.
This statement comes as Trump continues to advocate for his plan to take control of the Gaza Strip and resettle its population in neighboring Egypt and Jordan, despite opposition from Arab states.
King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday and also voiced his "steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank," adding that it was the "unified Arab position."
"Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all," the Jordanian king said.

Hamas condemns Trump's plan to empty Gaza of its Palestinian residents
Tuesday 11 February 2025 23:40
,
AP
The Palestinian militant group said the president's comments were "racist" and "a call for ethnic cleansing."
The group declared Tuesday that Gaza's residents have endured relentless bombardment and aggression but remain steadfast in their homeland.
In a statement on the messaging app Telegram, Hamas accused Trump of seeking to "liquidate the Palestinian cause and deny the national rights of the Palestinian people."
Trump repeated his plan Tuesday for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and remove its population. Neighboring Arab governments and the Palestinians have roundly rejected the idea.
United Nations experts define ethnic cleansing as a policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove the civilian population of another group from certain areas "by violent and terror-inspiring means."
Decision to block AP from Oval Office event a 'direct attack on press freedom'

Justin Baragona
The National Press Club has responded to the White House's decision to block an Associated Press reporter from today's executive order signing in the Oval Office. 
President Mike Balsamo said the move was "a direct attack on press freedom."
Read the statement below:
"No administration gets to decide how journalists do their jobs. The role of a free press is not to serve as an extension of any administration.
"Barring a journalist from an official event because their newsroom refuses to conform to government-imposed language is more than an attack on one reporter or outlet - it is an assault on the First Amendment and the public's right to know. 
"The role of the press is not to take orders from the government but rather to hold the government accountable.
"We call on the White House to immediately reverse course and recommit to respecting the role of an independent press in a democracy. Anything less sets a dangerous precedent and erodes the fundamental values of a free society."

A federal appeals court has refused to halt a judge's order requiring the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in federal grants and loans. States say the money remains frozen even after a court blocked a sweeping pause on federal funding.

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth says he welcomes the scrutiny of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency into the massive military budget. And he singled out climate programs for likely cuts.
The Defense Department, he said, "is not in business of climate change, solving the global thermostat. We're in the business of deterring and winning wars."
Defense officials have long argued that climate change will have a broad and costly impact on the military and national security, and have worked to reduce those risks and the department's energy use. Rising sea levels could swamp coastal bases and melting Arctic icecaps have opened sea lanes, escalating competition with China, Russia and others over valuable minerals in that region.
Speaking to reporters in Germany, Hegseth said they will search for billions of dollars in savings.
