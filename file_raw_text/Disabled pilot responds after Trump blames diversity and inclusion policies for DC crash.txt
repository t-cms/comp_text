A disabled pilot has called President 's suggestion that diversity and inclusion policies contributed to the Washington  plane crash a "gut punch" to disabled people.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday (29 January), Trump falsely claimed that the 's DEI principles played a role in the accident.
Miles O'Brien, a CNN aviation analyst and licensed pilot who lost an arm in an accident, responded to Trump's remarks, telling CNN that the FAA "does not forsake safety in order to include disabilities in the system."
