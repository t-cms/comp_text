Trump's federal aid pause is a necessary reassessment of funds
Arelis Ortega
February 10, 2025
President Donald Trump's decision to pause federal grants and loans is bound to spark intense debate.
While critics argue this is an attack on progressive policies, this pause is necessary to reassess where taxpayer money is going and whether these programs are cost-effective and beneficial for Americans.
This freeze does not impact essential federal assistance like Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, student loans or scholarships.
Instead, the administration is focusing on cutting unnecessary spending on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs, radical gender policies and Green New Deal initiatives, many of which have been implemented without proper oversight.
According to CBS News, a federal judge blocked the freeze just minutes before its implementation, delaying it for another week.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that although Trump rescinded the Office of Management and Budget memo, the federal funding freeze remains.
Critics of this pause argue it's purely political, and the irony of that argument is not lost on its supporters.
It is imperative to remember that federal funding should be based on notonlyideology but also effectiveness.
If programs like DEI and the Green New Deal are beneficial, they should be able to justify their funding through measurable results.
Taxpayer money is not infinite - it should be allocated purposefully to programs that serve the public interest rather than be virtue-signaling.
However, this pause must be executed clearly and strategically to avoid unintended consequences.
It should not result in relinquishing valuable research funding, infrastructure development or genuine equal opportunity initiatives.
Instead, the best approach would be to reallocate funding toward better programs.
In the case of DEI, that would be income-based equal opportunity programs, ensuring that assistance goes to those who need it, regardless of race, gender or political agenda.
Thus, outcomes are based on merit, unlike affirmative action's infamous discrepancies.
Regarding the Green New Deal, the U.S. should focus on responsibly using its natural resources.
The U.S. should avoid outsourcing oil from other countries-which only worsens foreign affairs.
It should refrain from going fully electric, which devastates both the economy and the environment in the pursuit of mining EV batteries and relies on unethical labor practices.
As for gender policies, the U.S. must ensure institutions do not exploit and experiment on children with gender dysphoria.
Early use of hormone blockers can cause permanent side effects and render children temporarily dependent on the medical industry for symptoms they wouldn't have otherwise.
Studies link their usage without parental consent to higher suicide rate.
The choice to transition should be reserved for consenting adults only.
Government spending should be practical, accountable and focused on real solutions and results, not driven by ideological trends or exploitation.
If the Green New Deal, gender policies and programs like DEI are as beneficial as their supporters claim, they should withstand further inspection.
If not, taxpayer dollars should be spent on more reasonable, ethical and cost-effective alternatives.
It's crucial to pause, reassess and rightfully draw the line.
