Data: U.S. Census Bureau, IPUMS; Note: Includes air traffic controllers and airfield operations specialists working in air transportation or services incidental to transportation; Chart: Axios Visuals
President Trump   
The big picture: Statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau and IPUMS show air traffic controllers and airfield operations specialists are predominately male and white.
By the numbers: 78% are men, while 22% are women, per data from the U.S. Census Bureau and IPUMS.
71% identify as non-Hispanic white.
The data includes air traffic controllers and airfield operations specialists working in air transportation or services incidental to transportation.
Driving the news: Trump on Thursday repeatedly cited DEI policies at the Federal Aviation Administration as having played a role in the crash, and blamed Democrats including Presidents Biden and Obama, for advancing inclusive workplace policies.
Trump implicitly equated racial, gender and other forms of diversity with a lower-quality federal workforce.
Reality check: In addition to the statistics showing the opposite is true, the cause of the crash has not been determined and there's no evidence that FAA hiring policies led to a decline in aviation safety.
Zoom in: Trump  
The "disabilities" language that Trump is opposing was in FAA regulations during the entirety of his first term and first appeared around 2013, per fact-checking website  
The American Association of People with Disabilities  
"It is extremely inappropriate for the President to use this tragedy to push an anti-diversity hiring agenda," the AAPD said. "Doing so makes all Americans less safe."
