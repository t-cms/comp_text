All diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility activities required of federal funding in grants will cease at UF, according to an email sent by the university's Vice President for Research, David Norton.
On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order - Initial Recessions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions - effectively repealing former President Joe Biden's 2024 executive order: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce.
The previous DEIA order established resources and equal opportunity across the federal government, as well as a "Government-wide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Strategic Plan."
The order comes almost a year after the university eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion offices and positions following a 2023 memo from the state, The Alligator previously reported.
"Any contract or grant activity that uses or promotes the use of DEIA principles and frameworks or violates Federal anti-discrimination laws should cease immediately," the email said.
Anyone who received a termination or suspension order may forward their notices to the Division of Sponsored Programs.
