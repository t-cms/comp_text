JASON RANTZ, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: So, kudos to Charles Barkley.
CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL "FOX & FRIENDS" WEEKEND CO-HOST: Indeed. Jason, thank you so much for joining us.
That's it for us tonight. I'm Charlie Hurt in for Laura Ingraham, thank you for watching.
You can catch me every weekend on "Fox & Friends" Weekend from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM Eastern.
Jesse Watters takes it from here.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
ANNOUNCER: Drivers, start your engine.
WATTERS: The Golden Age is on the fast track, and the media is a wreck.
MICHAEL STEELE, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Get out their fat ass and say something about it.
KRISTI NOEM, US HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: President Trump has a clear message for those that are in our country illegally, leave now. If you don't, we will find you and we will deport you.
WATTERS: It's official. Trump has shut down the border.
NOEM: You will never return.
ALI VITALI, MSNBC HOST: Presidential historians says Presidents' Day is ridiculous. We should scrap it.
LINDSAY CHERVINSKY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: We have had some real duds, so I'm not sure we really want to be celebrating all presidents.
WATTERS: Democrats want to cancel Presidents Day.
ANA KASPARIAN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The least they can do is shut the eff up.
WATTERS: Plus --
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Ronald Reagan famously said, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tear down his pants.
WATTERS: Happy Presidents' Day. 47 celebrated at Daytona.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SPORTSCASTER: Donald Trump taking some hot laps. We expect to talk to the president.
SPORTSCASTER: Forty-one race cars and one presidential limousine are lined up on Pit Road.
SPORTSCASTER: We've got the president on the ground. The Thunderbirds flying overhead. Daytona has America on display.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is your favorite president. I'm a big fan. I am a really big fan of you people that you do this. I don't know, but I just want you to be safe. You're talented people, and you're great people, and great Americans.
Have a good day. Have a lot of fun and I'll see you later.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: There was a very special guest inside of the limo, Trump's granddaughter, Carolina, just doing some laps in The Beast with grandpa.
Why was the president there?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It's great for the country. Our country is doing well again, and we have spirit all over the world. There's spirit again. We brought it back, and it's been less than four weeks, so you'll see what we do, and in a little period of time, it's going to only get better, but this is very exciting.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The American Spirit showed up on the track and on the ice. Over the weekend, USA and Canada faced off, and our oh, so polite neighbors to the north booed their future National Anthem, so we ripped off the gloves.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(PEOPLE booing American National Anthem)
SPORTSCASTER: And this coordination. Here we go. This is underway and the gloves are off.
Did not see this coming.
And here they come breaking right.
Break the fort of the first. Good shot.
Bennett in the lineup for the first time. Change was made. Bennett jumped on the ice and three seconds to fight.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Four fights later, and the Americans won three to one. Governor Trudeau is there to witness the spanking.
It doesn't have to be like this. We should all be skating under the same flag, and we take gold at every Winter Olympics. That's what I'd call the Golden Age.
And here at home, Democrats feel like Canadians. Democrats say we're not even a month into this administration. In dog years, it feels like it's been 20 years.
Even the holiday weekend couldn't slow DOGE down. There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives where snikkety librarians were getting DOGEd silly. The Dewey Decimal System is next.
It was pink slip city at the FDA, Medicare and Medicaid and the IRS is on deck.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHEN MILLER, DEPUTY CHIEF-OF-STAFF OR POLICY AND HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: These are foreign nationals who come into the United States. They use fake Social Security numbers. They use fake identities to steal billions in taxpayer benefits. There's no way to know until DOGE gains full access exactly how much money we're talking about, but over a 10-year normal budget window, you could be talking about saving over a trillion dollars by clamping down on massive fraud in our tax and entitlement systems, including, again, those carried out by organized fraud and theft rings.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Biden hired 87,000 IRS agents, gave them guns, and we're getting ripped off to the tune of a trillion bucks, because Biden had his sights set on America's real enemy, Pete Hegseth.
Right before Inauguration Day, Biden's IRS audited Pistol Pete. Biden's son is a tax cheat, and he is auditing Hegseth. The incoming Defense Secretary who doesn't have enough on his plate keeping America safe.
So now Elon and Big Balls are going to audit the auditors and upgrade the software, because they're using programs from the 1960s. Democrats are hysterical that Elon and Big Balls are opening up the books because they assume Elon will just abuse their power like they did and audit their political enemies.
You remember, like Lois Lerner and then she fried 24,000 e-mails so Congress couldn't investigate? Democrats leaked Trump's tax returns to Madam Maddows like waving them live on TV. That's a felony, and they're worrying about Musk? Democrats are already in prison for doing what they're accusing Musk of.
Whose tax returns is he going to leak? Hunter's? He didn't file any.
Almost a thousand people have full unmasked access to taxpayer data. Twenty of them are student researchers. Basically interns have access to your tax returns. Democrats don't care. They only care when the guy who has access might find fraud.
Like all good detectives, DOGE is following the money. Next up on the list, Fort Knox, home to the largest gold reserve in the country, and we go years without sending inspectors in.
How much gold does Fort Knox hold? Only one way to find out.
This all happening while massive amounts of gold bullion are being flown in from London vaults. It can't all be because Judge Jeanine is going jewelry shopping, can it?
DOGErs are still sniffing out the bacon. Here's what they found this weekend. $35 million for a gender equality and women empowerment hub, a girl hub where women hang out and pump each other up, sounds like a sorority.
$29 million to strengthen political landscape in Bangladesh. That is so generic. It could be anything. Strengthen the political landscape. It's vague for a reason.
DOGE says we spent $21 million for voter turnout in India. Now imagine if the Indian government spent $21 million for voter turnout in America and Trump won. When they do it, it's election interference. When we do it, it's strengthening the political landscape.
One-and-a-half million for voter confidence in Liberia. What are we doing? Giving pep talks to Africans before they cast ballots? You got this. We got this. It's going to work this time.
Why are we spending so much money on other countries' elections while we're still counting votes in California?
DOGE also found $14 million for social cohesion in Mali. Mali is run by mercenaries and plagued by ancient ethnic warfare, not to mention landmines, torture, sexual violence, and child marriage. I'm sure that $14 million is just What Mali needs to be "socially cohesive."
And $2 million to help Kosovo and Egypt recycle. We don't even recycle here. What are we just buying them blue bins? We just bombed the bejesus out of Kosovo, and now we're telling them to recycle.
A new report says the government is already nearing a trillion dollars in the hole for the year. Democrats should not fight this. Their boys, Bill and Al were for DOGE before Doge was cool.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. President, if you want to know why government doesn't work, look behind you. The answer is, at least partly on those forklifts.
Is this the way it has to be? Well, the good news is that it doesn't have to be this way.
We can cut it dramatically. We can downsize government by 12 percent reducing the bureaucracy by 252,000 positions.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: DOGE is forklifting the fraud out of Washington. So what are Democrats doing? Sheryl Crow says she is selling her Tesla and donating the money to NPR. And RINOs are roaring at Democrats to do something.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEELE: So I just like to see somebody wake the hell up and get excited about the fact that your country is under assault.
They're not at the gate anymore. They're in your bedrooms. They're in your living rooms. They're in your businesses.
They've got your data, dumb ass. They've got all your stuff.
Elon Musk has his tentacles in everything you're doing, not just off of X, but now he's in the Treasury Department, he's in the Labor Department, he's in the Department of Homeland Security, and nobody seems to give a damn.
So that's all I want somebody to show that they care enough to get off their fat ass and say something about it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: What Steele is saying is the Democrats believe the government is theirs. It's not your government, it's theirs. To them, it is like DOGE is auditing the DNC, so this is just another Watergate. They're acting like Trump didn't win the election and he has no right to run the government.
Instead of defending the taxpayers, the media is defending the government. Here's "60 Minutes."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KRISTINA DRYE, FORMER USAID SPEECHWRITER: People are really scared. I think that you know, 12 days ago, people knew where their next paycheck was coming from. They knew how they were going to pay for their kids' daycare, their medical bills, and then all gone overnight.
SCOTT PELLEY, "60 MINUTES" CORRESPONDENT: All gone overnight for Kristina Drye and Adam Dubard, fired this month in the chaotic shutdown of foreign aid.
ADAM DUBARD, FORMER USAID EMPLOYEE: They're not looking for competency. They're not looking for if you're good at your job. They're looking for pure loyalty tests, and if you don't give it, you will be punished.
PELLEY: There was no process. No one explained to them why they were being relieved.
DRYE: To my knowledge, they received an e-mail and then if they didn't leave the building, they were escorted out of the building.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: These people got generous buyouts, eight month severance. I'm sorry, but did CBS interview the fired Keystone Pipeline workers? The fired Army officers who refused the needle? Or Black Americans who lost their job to migrants? No.
That one lady was Samantha Power's speech writer. She's no random civil servant. She's the top flak for the USAID chief.
Just last week, this same lady told ABC she was pocketing her pride flags. The networks are using the same victim over and over.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DRYE: DOGE was in the building. We started -- we took down our pride flags. We took down -- I took out any books I felt would be incriminating.
No one was talking. We heard they started taking transcripts automatically of all of our Google Meets. They unplugged the news in the little kitchen galleys. It didn't feel good.
And then Saturday, all of the websites went down, and then I lost complete access to my computer.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: "60 Minutes" is CBS' premier investigative unit, and they never mentioned the $20 million for Iraqi "Sesame Street" or sex changes in Guatemala or DEI operas, or all the dough spent on failed coups, never mentioned it.
We're $36 trillion in debt. We're cutting head count, just like media organizations do to balance their books, just like Clinton and Gore did.
Last week, Vance was in Germany and told the chancellor to knock off the censorship and step up their NATO spending, and the American media sided with the Germans and called Vance Hitler.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: He was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide, and he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups.
The context of that was changing the tone of it, and you know that that the censorship was specifically about the right.
MARCO RUBIO, US SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, I have to disagree -- no, I have to disagree with you.
Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal, because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those -- they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews.
There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: It was illegal to criticize the Nazi government. It was against the law to tell a joke about Hitler and he had a dumb mustache and one testicle. Couldn't joke about it.
Newspapers were shut down, books were burned, radio stations were censored. Free Speech didn't trigger the Holocaust. CBS' crack research team is too busy editing the Kamala interview to learn that.
On the same day, CBS celebrated an armed raid in Germany because a guy posted a cartoon.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SHARYN ALFONSI, "60 MINUTES" CORRESPONDENT: It's 6:01 on a Tuesday morning, and we were with State Police as they raided this apartment in Northwest Germany.
(UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.)
ALFONSI: Inside, six armed officers searched the suspect's home, then seized his laptop and cell phone. Prosecutors say those electronics may have been used to commit a crime. The crime: Posting a racist cartoon online.
And it's a crime to insult them online as well.
SVENJA MEININGHAUS, PROSECUTOR: Yes.
ALFONSI: If somebody posts something that's not true and then somebody else reposts it or likes it, are they committing a crime?
MEININGHAUS: In the case of reposting, it is a crime as well, because the reader can't distinguish whether you just invented this or just reposted it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Germany is letting migrants into the country who are committing gang rape and they have cops kicking down doors over a cartoon.
CBS is defending Germany, a country who started two world wars that cost millions of lives and who tariff our automobiles quite unfairly, I might add.
They are defending a country who boos our National Anthem, Canada.
Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America and the media is defending Mexico.
The media is defending the IRS. The media is defending cockamamie spending like millions for Egyptian recycling. Trump has the left defending the indefensible.
The Democrats have become so toxic that POLITICO is warning them to just stay out of the way. "Despite this intense daily barrage of negative reporting, Trump's drive to slash the size of the US government remains one of his most popular policies, and there's no sign of it stopping anytime soon."
Trump's in the driver's seat, and Democrats are getting lapped.
Judge Jeanine Pirro is a co-host of "The Five" and host of the new Fox Nation special "Subway Justice."
So the media didn't have a very good weekend, did they, Judge Jeanine?
JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST, "THE FIVE": No. I've got to tell you -- but I had a great weekend watching, and I'm sure you did too. I mean, watching President Trump on the race track at Daytona.
You know, it was -- his going on that race track is kind of a metaphor for his running circles around the Democrats. He's been doing it since the day he was elected.
And the amazing part of it, Jesse, is the campaign is over, but he's not stopping. He is continuing to kind of raise the American pride, American spirit. All of us feel good about it. I mean, he's at the UFC, he's at the Army-Navy game. He's at the Super Bowl. You know, this is a man who got shot, and that wasn't enough to stop him.
So all the while, while he's doing this and promoting patriotism, he is doing all kinds of jobs that the Americans put him in office to do, like, think about the fact that, you know, the Democrats think there's a constitutional crisis if you want to look under the hood.
And one of the things I found out today was the National Institute of Health put millions into studying parrots on meditation. I don't know how you get a parrot on meditation, but it goes on and on, and everything that they've been doing is proof positive that they're doing what the Americans want.
We have to balance our checkbook, so should they.
WATTERS: Maybe it was a parrot that was owned by a Democrat, and the owner was driving him crazy, and they just needed to chill.
PIRRO: Yes.
WATTERS: So the president has kind of renewed this American spirit where people are a little more happy about the country, feeling a little more optimistic and patriotic, and the media is defending Mexico, the Canadians booing our anthem, Germany, of all places. When is the press going to get it together?
PIRRO: You know what? I don't think the press is going to get it together.
WATTERS: Thank you, Judge.
PIRRO: That's an ode to his book, everybody.
WATTERS: Where books are sold.
WATTERS: I think that it's going to take them as long as it takes the Democrats, and as long as the Democrats don't understand it. Michael Steele can yell all he wants, as long as the Democrats don't understand that they have to get involved in things that the American people want to. We want the border closed, we want immigration stopped, we want our taxpayer dollars respected, then they're going to be on the out, and so be it.
If they want to fight this fight like you listen to Hakeem Jeffries and you're like, Hakeem, what are you talking about? You're in the room. Get involved. Work on legislation that the American people want.
And by the way, Margaret Brennan and the left wing media, how dare she say that Free Speech is responsible for the Holocaust? It's nothing more than the liberal attempt to shut down our Free Speech under the guise of preventing harm.
They're wrong historically, and they're wrong today.
WATTERS: There's a rumor going around you asked Elon to tag along while he looks into Fort Knox. Is that true?
PIRRO: I'll tell you. I'd love to go there myself, and by the way, all of America wants to be in that tag along.
WATTERS: All right, maybe Jeanine is going to embed with DOGE and we'll get to the bottom of Fort Knox.
PIRRO: I know.
WATTERS: Thank you so much.
PIRRO: Thank you, Jesse.
WATTERS: Kristi Noem has something she wants to show you, that's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: It took less than a month, and the flood of migrants crossing our border is now just a trickle. They were only 229 migrant encounters over the last 24 hours. That's down from 10,000 a day under Biden.
But Tom Homan, he won't be happy until that number reaches zero.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
THOMAS HOMAN, US BORDER CZAR: We've got almost 600,000 illegal aliens the United States with a criminal conviction. So I won't be happy till we eradicate every one of those.
And as far as TDA, we've got a few more hundred TDA to look for, and we're looking for them now. They're our priority.
Public safety threats remain a priority.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Caravans are U-turning and those already here are self-deporting.
One San Diego migrant shelter is shutting down because all the migrants are gone. Not a single migrant has shown up since Trump's Inauguration.
But the same media that freaked out over mass deportations now says Homan is not deporting illegals fast enough.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR AND POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: You've said roughly 14,000 migrants have been arrested in the first month of this administration, and that's well below the 1,500 daily arrests that the president says he wants to see.
You're getting support from across the federal government, from the FBI, from DEA, from US Marshals, even the military. What's the struggle? Why are you struggling to get those arrests where President Trump wants them?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The media is playing both sides again, but they're not the only ones. The recent DOGE audits have revealed just how much the US government is fighting itself funding both sides of the migrant crisis.
Not only do we pay to deport the illegals, we're also paying NGOs to help illegals avoid getting deported. That's ending now, but these deportations can't come soon enough.
Just last week, a trans migrant from Columbia was arrested in New York City for raping a 14-year-old boy in a bathroom.
Nicol Suarez was already wanted by ICE and authorities in Jersey and Massachusetts, where a federal law enforcement source tells us she was busted last June for armed robbery, prostitution and assault with a deadly weapon.
Trump is cracking down on illegals all across the board, the CIA is going to take on a bigger, more aggressive role in tackling the Mexican cartels. But let's not pretend that the CIA doesn't know what the drug lords are up to. They've had their hands in the cartel honey pot one way or another for a long time.
The administration is also out with a brand new ad warning migrants that they mean business. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NOEM: President Trump has a clear message for those that are in our country illegally, leave now. If you don't, we will find you and we will deport you. You will never return.
For too long, weak politicians left our borders wide open. They've flooded our communities with drugs, human trafficking and violent criminals. They put American lives at risk. Well, those days are over.
If you leave now, you may have an opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American Dream, but understand this, under President Trump, America's borders are closed to law breakers.
Follow the law and you'll find opportunity. Break it and you'll find consequences.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, joins me now.
How are you doing, Secretary?
NOEM: I'm doing -- I'm doing great, Jesse, thanks for having me on tonight, and thank you for previewing that ad. Those ads will be running not only in the country, but also internationally, all around the world, telling people that we are a nation of laws. Don't come to America if you plan to break our laws, and if you don't plan to come legally.
WATTERS: What kind of evidence are you seeing so far that these caravans have stopped, these people are self-deporting, and this thing has kicked into high gear?
NOEM: Yes, it has been incredible to see the numbers trickle down almost to zero. You know, we are talking less than a couple hundred people that we're encountering a day when it was literally over ten, eleven thousand under Joe Biden.
So it's been remarkable just what President Trump has been able to accomplish in these first few weeks of his administration. And remember, Jesse, one of the things that a lot of those news reporters don't want to talk about is the fact that President Trump doesn't have all of his people in place yet today. He doesn't have all of his team leading all of these agencies. He needs to get them confirmed and in place so that they can be a part of the solution.
But seeing that flow slowdown has been incredible, and the message that we're sending to the rest of the world through these commercials and through this marketing campaign is don't come here. We don't want illegals. We don't want criminals.
That America is a place where you come to pursue the American dream, and that this president will always put Americans first.
WATTERS: How uncooperative have some of these Democrat jurisdictions been? And how much of an obstacle is that to your administration, to the president's administration to continuing to deport all of these criminals?
NOEM: They've been big obstacles in some areas. These sanctuary cities, sanctuary counties are a struggle. That's why I'm excited to get Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice on board and use every authority that we have and work together on a plan to make sure that we're prosecuting everybody to the fullest extent the law that we can, and making sure that we're taking care of those criminal aliens where we're able to go after them, and that federal law, in many of these instances, is much more powerful than some of the laws that these cowards are standing behind.
WATTERS: All right, well, stay safe. I know you're joining some of these teams to do these raids. It's a risky business, and we hope you and everybody in law enforcement continues to stay safe and keep up the good work. Thank you so much, Secretary.
NOEM: Thank you, Jesse. Thank you.
WATTERS: Inside the Democratic Party Civil War, up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Kamala came out of hiding to give her few remaining fans a pep talk.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAMALA HARRIS (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When we think about like these moments where we see things that are being taken, but also, let's see it as -- you know, nature abhors a vacuum, so where there is a vacancy, then let's fill it, right? And let's know that the reality is that the progress of our nation has always been about the expansion of rights, not the restriction of rights.
We're seeing a U-turn right now, but we have to keep fighting for those rights to be maintained, which means we have to be vigilant, and it's just the nature of it.
But I believe we fight for something, not against something.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Fight for something? Big reason Kamala lost because she never told anybody what she was fighting for. All she was, was not Biden and not Trump, and Trump isn't the only one who dodged a bullet last year. Kamala could have been our president.
Instead, America put Democrats in time out, and fingers are pointing in every direction.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEN PSAKI, MSNBC HOST: I also think Liz Cheney is very heroic.
JON STEWART, "THE DAILY SHOW" HOST: Wait, what? How did that? Wait, where did that come?
PSAKI: Here we are. Here we are.
STEWART: What's that?
PSAKI: But I don't think closing the campaign with a message about fighting democracy with a former Republican member of Congress was the right strategy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrat donors are having some serious regrets about giving Kamala two bil, just to have it all disappear in a landslide.
Some donors are now writing Trump's name on their checks. Others are closing their wallets completely or threatening to send cash again unless the party gets a major overhaul.
With a cash drought, liberal activist groups are self-DOGEing laying off 20 percent of their staff.
One Democrat adviser is moving to Canada. He says the coup was a big mistake, called it Biden's side.
The Golden Age is giving them high anxiety. "Democrats are lost, politically, culturally, spiritually. Many Democrats privately fret that the current president is executive producing a massive shift in the zeitgeist. Trump's popularity, at least during his first three weeks in office, has never been higher."
When Democrats get nervous, they sing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(GROUP singing "Trump is not King. They are not turning back. No turning back. Stop the fascist now.")
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The grassroots' resistance, not what it used to be, between songs and some guy dragging a Trump doll with a noose around its neck, crickets from the media, but that's okay, Trump doesn't need them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS: Donald Trump's favorability rating is actually higher than it ever was the first time around: 63 percent favor federal government's recognition of only two sexes; 60 percent favor deporting immigrants who entered the United States illegally; 60 percent favor expanding oil and gas production; 59 percent favor declaring an emergency at the southern border. Is there anything you are seeing that Trump is doing that you are in favor of?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Let me say, as it relates to all of those issues, we're just at the beginning. The price of eggs is skyrocketing out- of-control. Inflation is on the way up. That was the core promise that's been broken.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: They're still stuck on the egg hoax. No one is buying it. Democrats need some new material.
For top Democrats in and out of elected office every day is an existential tug of war between worrying about sounding like shrill paranoiacs and worrying that they are not saying or doing nearly enough. They don't know what the next three-and-a-half years are supposed to be when they already hit constitutional crisis in the first three-and-a-half weeks.
Here's an idea --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALI VITALI, MSNBC HOST: The headline here is, presidential historian says Presidents' Day is ridiculous. We should scrap it. What do you mean?
LINDSAY CHERVINSKY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: It is a little bit silly. I mean, we have had some real duds, so I'm not sure we really want to be celebrating all presidents.
I think if we think of a president as someone to celebrate just because they exist, which is what the King was, and that's why they celebrated the King's birthday, then you kind of -- it does evolve into that argument that they can do no wrong.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: They're arguing to take away a day off? Democrats don't want federal workers to go back to work, but they want you to pick up an extra shift.
PRIMETIME is a pro-holiday show, even if we have to work. We just like to see you happy. Democrats, on the other hand --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KASPARIAN: This is the thing about the Democratic Party, they loathe their base. It was clear to me all the way back in 2016 with the way Hillary Clinton and all her cronies talked about Democratic voters, and it's even clearer to me now.
They feel entitled to their positions of power. They do not see themselves as public servants. They see you, the Democratic voters as their public servants.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Zachary Levi is an actor, and he's in the new movie, "The Unbreakable Boy."
Why, Zachary are the Democrats so anxious?
ZACHARY LEVI, "THE UNBREAKABLE BOY" ACTOR: I don't know. I mean, listen, the election did not go their way. That can bring a lot of anxiety. I think that, personally, I think that there's been so much propagandizing and so much brainwashing and so many lies that have been spread that I have a lot of empathy for people who feel anxious right now, for people that are afraid because they've been told to be afraid for a long time.
And I don't blame the voting Democrats for that, I blame the legacy media, by the way, I think sometimes even you guys here have said things that have stirred that pot.
WATTERS: Only Gutfeld. Oh, I've been shot straight.
LEVI: And I think that it's -- I think it's high time that everyone here at Fox News and everywhere else in the legacy media, I think we've got to try to recognize that people are very impressionable, are looking for truth, are looking for good leadership. And we've got to love each other there.
And so when, you know the other side -- almost all the other networks, not you guys, but were saying the things that were building Trump to be, you know, new Hitler and all that stuff, I think that's very detrimental.
I think that, you know, politics used to be more about like, let me tell you why my person is better, and now it's so much more about, let me tell you why the other one is worse.
And that negative attack, that negative approach is, this is why where we're at. And it's sad. It's very sad to me.
WATTERS: When you see people singing 1960s style, when you see Kamala Harris on Broadway inspiring people as you know she's capable of, what does that tell you about the trajectory that everybody's on?
LEVI: I don't know, they're trying to find answers, man.
You know, listen for people sitting where we're sitting, who were -- I was very supportive of Bobby Kennedy, that led me to Donald Trump and I am so grateful. I am so grateful that the election went the way that it did, and specifically because people like Bobby and Tulsi Gabbard are now in there and confirmed, and can do the work.
And listen, DOGE is complicated, right? Like, there are a lot of people that are very afraid right now, because there are truly good working people that work for the government that are getting lost in the cracks, and we have got to do something about that. Please, Elon and all of your team and whatever needs to happen, please don't let everybody fall through the cracks as we are doing what is necessary, which is to get in there and, like, cut a cancer out, man.
You know, sometimes they go in for cancer surgeries, doctors and you lose some good healthy tissue along in that. They don't want to do that, but it's a part of, like, extracting that darkness out of there.
And right now, that's what's happening. But there are good people, people that voted for Donald Trump, who are losing their jobs, and we got to make sure that we don't leave those folks behind.
WATTERS: Well said.
Tell me about "The Unbreakable Boy." Why are you so behind this film?
LEVI: It's just a beautiful film, man. I mean, it is. There's nothing big and glitzy and, you know, glamor-y about it. It's a true story, slice of life, about a family navigating the waters of marriage and raising children, one of which is autistic.
And I think that that is something that, at this point in human history, is ubiquitous. We all are touched by autism in one way, shape or form, and to be able to tell a story like ours, which is so authentic and so beautiful and also like so hard, like you really you -- you see the human condition laid out before you, and I think it really allows them the story of redemption, to kind of hit it even harder, and just figuring out how to radically accept where you are in life, radically surrender to that, and then let God radically love through you as you are in that, that kind of space in your life, it brings real peace.
And my character, particularly Scott LeRette, this is the journey he goes on in this film and so, from a personal and performance standpoint, I'm very proud of it all. I'm very proud of the film writ large, with everyone involved, Jon Gunn, our writer/director, and all of our wonderful actors and crew and everybody that came together in the height of the pandemic to go make this thing.
And now, four years on, we finally get to bring it to the world. It's special.
WATTERS: On the 21st of this month, you'll be able to see it in the theater.
LEVI: Yes. Yes, sir.
WATTERS: All right, and will you be wearing a scarf in the film at all?
LEVI: You know, he has been giving me crap above my scarf since I sat down. I like the scarf.
WATTERS: It's cashmere. It looks great.
LEVI: It is keeping me warm because it's cold outside.
WATTERS: It is the first scarf on set we've had and we're very proud. Thank you so much, Zach.
LEVI: Thanks for having me.
