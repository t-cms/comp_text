We Will Not Obey in Advance
By Arran Robertson
The first few weeks of the Trump administration have been exhausting and alarming. We won't rehash the daily barrage of news, but the reality is clear: the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the Constitution itself are under attack. Trump repealed an Executive Order protecting old-growth forests, froze funding for environmental justice programs, and suspended hiring by the National Park Service and other federal agencies. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and his enablers are running a chaotic shadow government that is recklessly endangering the personal information of millions of Americans.
For those working within the federal government, the anxiety is real. If you are a person of color, LGBTQ+, or a woman in a position of authority, the administration's war on "DEI" is more than just rhetoric--it's an attempt to erase progress and silence voices that belong in every room where decisions are made.
But know this: you are not alone. At Oregon Wild, we see you. We stand with you.
While we have long held federal agencies accountable when they fail to uphold environmental laws, we also recognize the dedicated career professionals who work every day to safeguard our public lands, waters, and wildlife. Scientists and civil servants are on the frontlines, pushing for the best possible outcomes, and some good work still happens despite political pressure. We know that for those committed to conservation and public service, these times are particularly fraught.
The challenges ahead are immense, but we are ready to meet them together. Oregon Wild remains committed to protecting our forests, rivers, and wildlife--and to standing with those who do the same from within the system. We will not be intimidated, and we will not back down. We will not obey in advance. We will keep fighting with you and for you.
Together, we will fight for a future where public lands serve the public good, not corporate greed. A future where science, justice, and integrity prevail, and a legacy of wildlands, wildlife, and clean water is preserved for all Americans.
