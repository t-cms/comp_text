American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers: "Americans sent a clear message at the ballot box, and President Trump is answering the call on Day 1. U.S. energy dominance will drive our nation's economic and security agenda. This is a new day for American energy, and we applaud President Trump for moving swiftly to chart a new path where U.S. oil and natural gas are embraced, not restricted."
Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz: "Trump's two-fold approach of boosting oil and gas production and repealing the Biden administration's green energy mandates will make American energy cheaper, reliable and more efficient."
Mortgage Bankers Association President and CEO Bob Broeksmit: "President Trump campaigned on lowering costs for Americans, and we appreciate housing supply and affordability being included in an executive order on this issue. We support efforts to cut unnecessary regulatory red tape and to pursue federal housing program enhancements that make renting and homeownership more attainable and sustainable."
Professional Trucking Association Group: "President Trump's decision to freeze regulations and curtail bureaucratic overreach is commendable. This is precisely what America needs: reduced government interference and increased freedom for small trucking businesses and entrepreneurs to flourish."
NetChoice CEO Steve DelBianco: "Upon returning to office, President Trump showed that America is ready to lead in tech and innovation again. By repealing Biden's restrictive rules on energy production and AI development, the president is steering America to remain dominant in creating the best technology in the world."
United Against Nuclear Iran Chairman Governor Jeb Bush and CEO Ambassador Mark Wallace: "We applaud President Trump for his decision today to redesignate the Houthis as an FTO. UANI in its recommended action plan for the Trump administration's first 100 days suggested that the president redesignate the Houthis as an FTO. This will now provide the U.S. government additional authorities to hold the Houthis accountable for their threats to international commerce and U.S. allies and partners."
