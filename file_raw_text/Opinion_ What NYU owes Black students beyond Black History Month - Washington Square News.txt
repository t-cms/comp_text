Opinion: What NYU owes Black students beyond Black History Month
NYU's Black History Month celebrations ring hollow in light of the decline in Black student enrollment and the university's stance on President Donald Trump's radical anti-Black agenda.

Every February, NYU claims to commit to honoring its Black students. Through the annual Martin Luther King Jr. week and performances from the NYU Percussion Ensemble, the university showcases the talent and accomplishments of its Black students. But when it comes to taking a stand on policies that actively harm Black students, NYU has stayed silent. While the celebrations of Black History Month may make it seem like NYU is a progressive institution, the reality is that the university has failed to address the very real threats its Black student body faces.
NYU prides itself on its student diversity rankings and the accomplishments of marginalized groups. Specifically, during Black History Month, NYU showcases the immense achievements of its Black undergraduate and graduate students. Their other celebrations are limited and have at times been offensive. In NYU's notorious cafeteria failure of 2018, when NYU served Kool-Aid and watermelon-flavored water to students in honor of Black History Month, they fell short in cuisine and culture. Black students at NYU come from all areas of the country and world, and NYU must do more to honor them than serve racialized and insensitive dining hall menus.
NYU also falls short when ensuring the protections and presence of its dwindling Black student body. In the wake of the Supreme Court's 2023 decision to end affirmative action, Black student enrollment at NYU decreased from 7% to 4% for the class of 2028, and Latino student enrollment fell from 15% to 10%. Instead of publicly committing to new measures that ensure Black applicants have equal access to higher education, NYU has opted to take no action or stance. 
NYU needs to protect the safety and rights of its Black students. In light of the new Trump administration, NYU must reassure its students that policies to protect them are still upheld. President Donald Trump has repeatedly come after marginalized communities - following last week's tragic plane crash in Washington, D.C., Trump's insistence that the crash could be related to diversity, equity and inclusion measures currently in place may lead to more alterations in nationwide DEI policies. Trump has also announced plans to eliminate race-conscious hiring and as of last week, has cut funding from schools that provide critical race theory courses - which NYU does - labeling them divisive concepts that "indoctrinate" students. All of these policies will have direct and drastic effects on Black faculty, students and prospective applicants. 
In light of Trump's comments, along with the reversal of affirmative action, NYU must work to preserve its "data-driven DEI strategy and related implementation" for the success of its Black and other minority students. By not addressing Trump's attacks on Black and minority employees domestically, NYU has done little to nothing to reaffirm their safety on campus. 
In a recent email sent out to the student body, NYU President Linda Mills barely touched on the current administration's changes, stating, "Whether we are issuing public comment or not, I want to reassure you that we remain keenly focused on sustaining and upholding our community's values and safeguarding our scholarly mission." Without any specifics as to how they plan to do so, or even the ability to call out the current administration's discriminatory policies, this lukewarm reassurance is meaningless. 
Moreover, NYU must celebrate the achievements of its Black students beyond February. Despite its efforts during the month, such as selling books by Black authors in the NYU library, NYU remains relatively silent on its Black students and employees' successes outside of the month. 
Given Trump's attacks on DEI, NYU needs to go beyond book sales and performances and reaffirm the safety and celebration of Black students this Black History Month more than ever. They need to take action, first and foremost by publicly committing to protecting DEI initiatives under federal attacks. They must address the drop in Black student enrollment, and outline concrete steps that will ensure racial diversity in admissions. NYU needs to make clear how it will protect its Black students moving forward in light of a new and more intense Trump era, and ensure that it is aptly honoring its students during and beyond their college experience. 
NYU should work with Black students to understand what they want implemented to make the most of Black History Month. A great start would be hosting more events by well-renowned speakers within the Black community, showcasing Black culture and talent on campus, and honoring pivotal figures beyond Martin Luther King Jr., such as Malcolm X - and ensuring that they are discussed and taught year-round. 
Performative gestures pale in comparison to scholarships and mental health resources that provide active, monetary and emotional support for historically marginalized communities. NYU cannot celebrate Black history without actively protecting Black futures. Black students deserve performances and panels - but above all they deserve protection.
