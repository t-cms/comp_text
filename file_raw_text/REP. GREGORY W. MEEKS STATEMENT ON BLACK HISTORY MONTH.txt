The following information was released by the office of New York Rep. Gregory Meeks:
Today, Congressman Gregory W. Meeks (NY-05) released the following statement on Black History Month:
"It is critical that we continue recognizing the profound contributions that African Americans have made to our country. We honor all of those trailblazers who persevered through the horrors of slavery and the Jim Crow era to pave the way for major achievements in every segment of this country including science, engineering, mathematics, entertainment, technology, culture, public service, business, the military and much more. Black innovation, entrepreneurship, resilience, and perseverance are woven into the very fabric of this nation. We continue to make remarkable strides in breaking barriers by entering fields such as artificial intelligence where our accomplishments reshape the tech landscape. This Black History Month, we must choose to educate and challenge narratives that perpetuate the marginalization of African Americans. Although we have made so much progress, we cannot neglect the work that lies ahead to deliver on the promise of our great nation for all Americans.
"While the Trump Administration wrongly pursues an anti-DEI agenda that ignores our country's past of historical, systematic exclusion of African Americans, we as Americans must remember that diversity is the foundation of our country. It strengthens democracy by embracing unique perspectives that serve our society. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are American values that must not be dismantled.
"After all, Black history is American history."
