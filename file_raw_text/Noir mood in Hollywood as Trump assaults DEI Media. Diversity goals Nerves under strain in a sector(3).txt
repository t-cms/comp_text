Hollywood was a hotbed of resistance to Donald Trump during his first term, but this time the mood is more defensive than defiant.
In film studios, music labels and talent agencies, there are nervous discussions about how to protect a creative, diverse workforce while avoiding the wrath of the Trump administration, which is determined to stamp out policies designed to encourage inclusion.
"Employees are definitely scared," said an executive at a Hollywood company. Workers were wondering whether employers were committed to "standing by their values".
Disney, the world's largest traditional media company, did not wait to be told by the Trump administration to adapt its policies. It dropped "diversity and inclusion" last week as a performance metric for executives, the first such shift by a big US entertainment conglomerate since Trump's return.
Labelled "woke Disney" by critics, the company appeared to be walking a fine line between catering to the president, who is on the warpath against diversity, equity and inclusion, and its employees, who tend to lean left.
In a convoluted internal note sent by Disney's HR department, the company said it was dropping DEI as a "performance factor" but still identified "inclusion" as one of its core corporate values.
The memo came days before Trump's Federal Communications Commission said it was launching a probe into Comcast, owner of NBC and the Universal studio. In a letter, FCC chair Brendan Carr said the inquiry aimed to discover whether Comcast's DEI efforts were "promoting invidious forms of discrimination". The letter, addressed to Comcast chief Brian Roberts, used the word "invidious" five times and called DEI initiatives a "scourge".
Comcast's website includes a DEI page professing its commitment to diversity. On Friday, it was topped by a blog post about the studio's efforts to create an "accessible" set for a disabled actor in the Wicked films.
Victor Pickard, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the FCC had been politicised in the past but moves by Carr suggested "a kind of regulatory capture that is unprecedented".
He said: "He's clearly carrying water for President Trump's agenda to bring media companies to heel."
Some US media businesses, speaking anonymously, said that they would largely keep their DEI efforts while dropping the term DEI, which has become toxic after rightwing activists and politicians have set out to banish it.
One music executive said: "We're still going to think about the diversity of our workforce. For us it's a commercial imperative. Now, are we going to say, 'Here are our 10 DEI commitments' and call them DEI commitments like everyone was doing? Probably not.
"I think a lot of media companies will say, 'No, we will continue doing what we're doing, but we're not going to call it
DEI'. Because you've created this swirl of shit around that term."
The Hollywood executive said that DEI was "being used as a slur" but diversity remained essential to the creative industries in a way that might not be true for other businesses. "We're focused on creativity and storytelling, so in order to do that in effective ways, we need diversity of thought, a background of creative innovation and inspiration. And so I think that puts us squarely in a different position than other organisations."
Trump, a reality TV star before being president, has always been fixated on the media. He has made it a priority - even as he has waged trade wars, floated annexing Canada and gutted government agencies - to attack TV groups and stage a coup against Washington's Kennedy Performing Arts Center. He replaced the Kennedy Center's board last week and appointed himself chair, posting that he would usher in a "GOLDEN AGE of American Arts and Culture" and ensure there was no more "ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA". Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes resigned from the board.
For media businesses that have already been besieged by threats to their business - the pandemic, the shift to streaming, strikes and artificial intelli- gence - a hostile president is coming at a vulnerable moment.
"It's hard right now if you're a media company. Really, really hard," said the music executive. "Some companies got to a place of, like, we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't. So maybe we should just say less."
Disney's moves this week, while subtle, landed with a thud among some employees and entertainment observers. Richard Rushfield, editorial director of The Ankler, wrote on Thursday: "We're not at the point of Steve Bannon having script approval of every project shot in Hollywood, but we're not a million miles away from that either."
Netflix and Spotify did not respond to requests for comment. Warner Bros Discovery and Comcast declined to comment. Paramount did not return calls for comment.
A key question is whether others follow Disney's lead, or whether they defy the Trump administration. "Hollywood represents something that's quite progressive. The progressive forces in America are utterly befuddled about what to do next," said the music executive. "It's just this thing where Hollywood is, like, we've got to make sure that we don't get crushed by this moment." See Moral Money
