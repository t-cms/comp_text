LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: We'll bring it all to you, along with an interview with the Secretary in the coming days. You're not going to want to miss it.
Thank you for watching. It's America now and forever. Jesse is next.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're doing another thing. If they don't report for work, we're firing them. That's another scam. If I'm staying home, my golf handicap would get down to a very low number. I'd try and get on tour.
WATTERS: The Elon Musk order that's making everyone go crazy.
TRUMP: I couldn't stand it. What can I do? Donald, don't get angry, please.
KAMALA HARRIS (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the Oval Office.
The American story will be written by you.
WATTERS: Kamala gets a participation trophy.
HARRIS: Because the fight is worth it.
THOMAS HOMAN, US BORDER CZAR: I'm coming to Boston, I'm bringing hell with me.
(PEOPLE chanting "Homan.")
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
WATTERS: Homan and the Democrats on a collision course.
HOMAN: If I offend anybody today, I don't give a (bleep).
WATTERS: Plus, why wasn't Joe this busy?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They called him Sleepy Joe, don't they? He must have been asleep.
WATTERS: What did you do last week? If you work for the federal government, and you can't answer that by midnight, you might be getting DOGEd.
This weekend, every D.C. bureaucrat got this message in their inbox: Please reply to this e-mail with five bullets of what you accomplished last week with a deadline, and if you don't answer, that's kind of your answer.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I thought it was great, because we have people that don't show up to work, and nobody even knows if they work for the government. So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week? What he's doing is saying, are you actually working? And then if you don't answer, like you're sort of semi fired, or you're fired because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: I can tell you what I did last week. Worked on a Federal holiday, plugged Dana's new book, pushed DOGE dividend checks, you're welcome. Shut down Jessica on "The Five" politely; and sold some Fox merch. Cha-ching. Now I came up with that in five minutes. If I had 48 hours, like those federal workers do, it would have been even better.
But when I was putting together the list, I was inspired, and now I've asked the entire PRIMETIME Team to send me their five bullet points on what they accomplished last week and the deadline is at 6:00 AM tomorrow, and we're going to send you and show you what their bullet points are tomorrow, and I'll let you know if I fired anybody.
Nobody on my team was angry when I sent the e-mail, but for some reason, federal workers are.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: Tell us about this e-mail and what it was like receiving it, and what you all have talked about after getting it.
MT SNYDER, FEDERAL WORKER: Sure, I got this e-mail Saturday afternoon, about 3:00 PM and I felt absolutely infuriated getting this e-mail with a demand within 48 hours to provide a response on what I did within the last week or face termination.
This is clearly an attempt from Elon Musk to harass and bully and intimidate the federal workforce.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Putting together a list of accomplishments was maybe the most work some of these bureaucrats did all year. If it's that hard for you to name five things you've accomplished in a week that should tell you something, and if it makes you mad or infuriated that you're being asked, that should also tell you something. It tells me a lot of these federal workers don't want to justify their jobs because they feel they're entitled, and that's a bad attitude, and that attitude is about to change.
And was it just me, or did that work? Or sound like she was reading from a script? I think I saw her eyes moving back and forth. And what? Has this woman never had a review? If the answer is no, then that's a huge problem. People are getting laid off. Tell me why you should stay.
If the CEO of Bank of America asks me, Jesse, what did you accomplish last week? I don't run to CNN and cry and tell the anchor I'm mad. If I've been doing a good job, I'm psyched for the opportunity to present my boss with a list of my amazing accomplishments so I can get a raise and a promotion and keep helping the company.
You either have a winning attitude or the attitude of the loser. The winner loves the e-mail, the loser is whining.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL STEELE, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This nonsensical e-mail from Elon Musk acting like we're in kindergarten.
AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: The new Trump administration is reveling in its bad knuckle approach to governing.
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: This is so sloppy with the way Elon Musk is handling this.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Why is the media treating these workers like the CEO's spoiled brat son? You know who comes and goes as he pleases, drinks at lunch, and harasses the secretaries? He's untouchable. We all know the guy.
The media is treating the federal workforce like they're untouchable. Oh, you can't make them come to the office. You can't fire them. You definitely can't log into their computers, and you can't e-mail them on a weekend.
These are public servants. They're supposed to serve the public. When we ask, how are you serving us? That's an issue. Maybe it's because they're not serving us. They're serving themselves.
Journalist Chris Rufo just uncovered a Deep State sex chat at the National Security Agency. Chat logs show Intel officials were using a chat room to share their fetishes and kinks and brag about getting sex changes, and it goes back two years, a transgender sex chat while they were on the clock.
When you think about it, this was a taxpayer funded transgender sex chat. Here's a taste. Viewer warning: This one guy had just had his manhood surgically removed: "One of the weirdest things that gives me euphoria is when I pee. I don't have to push anything down to make sure it aims right."
Here's another: "Getting my blank zapped by a laser was shocking."
Fine. I'll just do one more. This one guy is talking about how excited he is that the bulge is gone and he can wear bikinis after his sex change surgeries. I know, and these are Intel officials.
These people are in charge of guarding the nation's deepest secrets and spying on our enemies. How mentally tough are these people if they're having doctors chop off their body parts and then celebrating it on a work computer. You know how easy it is to blackmail somebody like that? Do you know how China or Russia or the Iranians, what they would do if they got their hands on this? First they'd laugh, but then they'd compromise every single one of these reckless agents.
Elon asked, what did you accomplish at work last week? I sexted with my colleagues about pouring hot wax on my nipples. This is what happens when 96 percent of the federal workforce works from home. They're having sex change surgeries while they're working from home, and their bosses don't even know about it.
I bet we paid for those sex change surgeries, and then they're all in the group chat all day. Hey, how was your operation? Mine was great, still a little sore, but now I can live my own truth.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: If you don't report to work, you know, that's another scam. You know, who the hell -- if I'm staying home, I'm going to, let's see, my golf handicap would get down to a very low number. You'd be shocked if I told you the real number, but I would be so good that I'd try and get on tour, I would be so good.
I'd call up. I'd say, listen, I'm really working here. Where are my clubs? Where are my clubs?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The Senate is even being put to work.
Majority Leader Thune is making senators work late into the night and ready -- they are working on Fridays now. Yes, and no surprise, senators are already complaining. They want to go home.
Democrat Senator Mark Kelly, also a pilot, says he used to run a plane and fly himself home every Friday. Alas, he's barely flown on that plane this year. He says, unless I want to do it on the weekend, and that's if I get back on the weekends.
We're $36 trillion in debt because of guys like that, and they're complaining they have to work on a Friday, not even a summer Friday, a Friday in February.
USAID has been emptied out. Two thousand workers were just fired. Should have taken the buyout while you had the chance. It does make sense though, they didn't want to leave because the gravy train was just too thick and tasty.
For Haiti alone, USAID doled doubt $2 billion in contracts. Guess how much of that money actually went to Haiti? Two percent. Only two percent of the $2 billion went to where it was supposed to. Half of it went to all of these aid groups based around D.C. You can't give it to Haiti directly, they just steal the money, so we're going to give it to all of our liberal friends who won't steal the money, and then they'll give it to Haiti, but they didn't.
Are liberals just stealing from poor Black people and calling it compassion? A "New York Post" report says the Red Cross raised $500 million for Haiti, and that money was supposed to build homes for 130,000 people. They built six. $500 million to build six homes in Haiti, where home is not really Mar-a-Lago.
And here's a juicy one for you. Meet LaTricea Adams. She was an advisor to the Biden White House. How she got that job? I have no idea. "The Free Beacon" reports that while she was working as a White House adviser, our friend, LaTricea applied for a contract, and not just any contract, a $20 million contract.
This $20 million contract was for environmental justice, and right before Biden leaves office, he gives this $20 million contract to LaTricea. Her group, Young, Gifted and Green got the 20 million. More like young, grifted, and green.
Does LaTricea have any background in environmental science? No, not really. Ten years ago, LaTricea was a high school Spanish teacher. She has a Bachelor's in Spanish. She's based in Memphis, Tennessee, not the greenest city.
And you know what Biden does? Biden audits Pete Hegseth. This lady, LaTricea, screaming for an audit. We used to prosecute graft at the Department of Justice, I guess we don't anymore.
LaTricea can just walk out of the White House with $20 million. What did LaTricea do with the $20 million? Well, we went to their website. The only thing they did last year was the Black Maternal and Environmental Health Day. They started a holiday. It's April 4th. These people look really legit.
This is exactly why Trump wants to go visit Fort Knox.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far, and we've just started. We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Finding waste, fraud and abuse isn't even that hard. You can save money with a stroke of a pen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TULSI GABBARD, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: ODNI itself is a pretty small organization compared to most other elements, but even in that small organization, getting rid of DEI saved American taxpayers roughly $20 million, literally with a stroke of President Trump's pen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Not even Nancy Pelosi is DOGE proof. According to reports, Trump is looking to sell off the 18-story Nancy Pelosi Federal Building in San Francisco. The building is empty because HHS told its employees not to work there anymore because it's too dangerous.
Pelosi's building is surrounded by homeless, needles and prostitutes.
It's about time America had a house cleaning.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The fraudsters, liars, thieves, globalists and Deep State bureaucrats are being sent packing. The illegal alien criminals are being sent home. We're draining the swamp, and we're restoring government by the people, for the people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Counselor to President Trump, Alina Habba is here.
So Alina, are all of these people putting together their five bullet points tonight?
ALINA HABBA, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had a hard time putting it into five, so I'm not sure why it was such an issue. Yes, an e-mail went out asking for accountability, because if you're going to take taxpayer dollars from people's homes that could barely afford to take care of their kids or buy eggs under the Biden administration, you better damn well explain to us what it is you're doing with taxpayer dollars while you're working for the federal government.
I was happy to get the e-mail, I'll answer it. There's no problem here when you're actually doing your job, Jesse, like you said.
So you know people crying wolf on CNN and MSDNC, they can feel free to continue doing so. We're here to be accountable.
WATTERS: What do you think the mentality is that they get mad when the boss asks them what they did last week, or they just refuse to even reply to the e-mail?
HABBA: Yes, so it's like gaslighting, you know when you ask somebody if they've done something, and then all they say is, why did you ask? You must be attacking me. That's pretty much what's happening --
WATTERS: Yes, bullying.
HABBA: Bullying me, yes.
No, it's called doing your job. If you get paid, you have to do your job. And I'll be honest with you, here in the White House, nobody really had an issue with it. We're all so busy I think that the American people know we're working hard.
But if you are taking another job, if you are pretending to work from home, but you're not actually working, and American taxpayers are paying for it, you better read damn sure that President Trump is going to figure it out. DOGE is going to cut the waste, cut the fat, and you would no longer have a job here.
They definitely should have taken that paycheck when they were offering it to them for October.
WATTERS: What was one of Alina Habba's bullet points from last week's list of accomplishments?
WATTERS: I think my biggest bullet point is top secret, so I can't say it, but I can tell you that I did things from speaking to people in the Middle East to child trafficking to making sure our country is better, and at the end of the day, I worked my butt off because that's what I committed to do when I took this job, and if you can't answer something like that with five, I truly could not put it in five. I mean, I probably would have pages.
If you can't answer it, that's a serious problem, and I don't want you working alongside of me, President Trump, or for the American people, because that's my taxpayer dollars, too.
WATTERS: Are there people in the White House and in the administration that are just pumped to go to work every day? They're up at the crack of dawn, they're in. They're just fighting for the mission. And then you have this other group of people that just like, oh, my God, he's back.
HABBA: Yes, so I work in the West Wing, so there's definitely none of that under where I work, but I can tell you the latter definitely exists.
You know, I'm good friends with a lot of people are doing the hiring and the hiring and the firing, and all of these individuals that are running departments, there are no games. We are all together working hard, and I have heard it.
Look you have people crying, people protesting. If you're wasting American taxpayer dollars to sit outside and hold a beer can or complain about Elon Musk, I have a question for you, what are you actually doing for your constituents? The people that voted for you in? Because you're not serving America.
So all of that, all the woke stuff, the DEI stuff, the woman that you just showed that got $20 million, there won't be any of that in this administration. It's just not tolerated.
WATTERS: All right, well, Alina had 10 to 20 bullet points. She had to narrow it down to five.
HABBA: At least.
WATTERS: Good to talk to you, Alina, thank you so much.
HABBA: Good to see you.
WATTERS: Trump just hired another Fox guy.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Today, President Trump is hosting French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. Things got a little handsy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I just want to tell you a little story. So we were at the Eiffel Tower having dinner with your wonderful wife and with my wonderful wife, and we came out and he started speaking the French deal, and we didn't have an interpreter, and he was going on and on and on, and I was just nodding yes, yes, yes.
And he really sold me out, because I got back the next day, I read the papers, I said, that's not what we said.
He's a smart customer, I will tell you that.
EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: Not true.
TRUMP: That wasn't exactly what we agreed to.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: There hasn't been this much grabbing at the White House since Clinton.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MACRON speaking in foreign language.)
TRUMP: By the way, that is the most -- that is the most beautiful language. I have no idea what he's saying, but that is the most elegant, beautiful language.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Macron is in town to talk Ukraine and how to end the bloodbath.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I think the war could end soon.
REPORTER: How soon?
TRUMP: Within weeks.
REPORTER: Weeks?
TRUMP: Yes, I think so, right. Don't you think so? I'd like to ask, have you -- I think we could end it within weeks. If we're smart. If we're not smart, it will keep going, and we'll keep losing young, beautiful people that shouldn't be dying, and we don't want that. And remember what I said, this could escalate into a Third World War, and we don't want that either.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Ukraine war is one of the many things started under Biden that Trump hopes to stop.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: He was the worst president in the history of our country. I don't care, I'll say it. Jimmy Carter passed away recently, and he passed away a happy man.
He was a happy man when he passed away because he said, that is not even close. Joe is the worst. And believe me, I have to clean up the mess. I'm cleaning up the mess, and it is a mess on the border, with inflation -- we can go over -- every single thing he touched turned to (bleep), okay.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Doing the opposite of what Joe Biden did is now the most popular thing in the country. Voters, by wide margins, support deportations, DOGE, tariffs, closing the border and ending DEI. Look at that.
Trump's executive orders are so popular he is selling merch. Gulf of America and Make Greenland Great Again t-shirts flying off the shelves.
Last week, Trump met with Apple CEO in the Oval and now the company is making its largest investment ever in the United States $500 billion. Twenty thousand new jobs, a lot of that go into red states, too.
Even MSNBC has to admit, Trump is winning.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DANNY CEVALLOS, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: Over the weekend, I read all these headlines, and the headlines were like: Trump suffers legal blows. Another one was Trump get hit with unexpected loss.
People watching those headlines especially people who don't like Trump, are going to think Trump is getting his butt kicked, and then when these he wins invariably, he's going to win some of these cases, they're going to say, well, what happened to all the butt kicking?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Good headlines, bad headlines. The Trump team knows how to handle the media.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: Mr. Secretary, why did you select an underqualified retired lieutenant general to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? Given that --
PETE HEGSETH, US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SECRETARY: I am going to choose to reject your unqualified question.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Hegseth is going to Guantanamo Bay tomorrow. The Press won't like that either, but this administration really doesn't care.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
THOMAS HOMAN, US BORDER CZAR: Let me start out by saying this, if I offend anybody today, I don't give a (bleep).
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
HOMAN: I don't care -- the media in the back room, I'm sure I'll be reading a lot of hit pieces on me tomorrow. I don't give a (bleep) what you think about me.
I wake up every day for the last four years pissed off because the Biden administration took the most secure border in my lifetime and unsecured it on purpose. Right?
I worked for six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan. Every president I ever worked for took steps to secure the border. Even Clinton and Obama took steps to secure the border.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Migrants used to get treated like celebrities under Joe Biden. A new report shows Biden let illegals cut through airport security lines faster than you and me, and I have PreCheck and CLEAR.
They had their own migrant express line. All they needed to do to get on the plane was the little border app they used to break into the country. That's all over now, and the migrants know it.
Now, it is time for sanctuary cities to get the message.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HOMAN: I read a story last night, the police commissioner of Boston, you said you'd double down on not helping the law enforcement office of ICE. I'm coming to Boston. I'm bringing hell with me.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: If Homan doesn't get you, Bondi will.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PAM BONDI, US ATTORNEY GENERAL: I sued the state of Illinois. I sued the Governor, and I said, If you don't stop, you're next. New York kept going, they were belligerent, sued New York, sued the Governor. Not going to stop.
So you know you're going to be next if you're not watching what we're doing, and we will be successful.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: We've never had a Justice Department like this. Bondi is running the show with Kash in charge of the FBI, and Kash just picked Dan Bongino to be the new Deputy Director of the FBI.
Bongino is former NYPD and Secret Service, and he's ready to revamp the Bureau. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAN BONGINO, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION DEPUTY DIRECTOR PICK: I can tell you right now, we are going to try our best. Every single thing I have in me, every single strand of DNA cell in my body is going to be dedicated towards keeping this homeland safe no matter what.
No matter what, that's my job. We're going to re-establish faith in this institution, the good people there doing their job, hitting the streets, developing sources. We'll have your back.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Michael Waltz is America's National Security adviser. So when you hear that Bongino is coming on, I'm sure you guys are going to be in the same rooms. What does that mean to you?
MICHAEL WALTZ, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, it means exactly what Dan just said, it is about restoring public trust in our national law enforcement institutions. It's about focusing the National Security apparatus of the United States either on defeating our enemies abroad, or keeping our enemies out of the United States, and then going after the bad guys and leaving the political nonsense aside and cleaning house in the leadership.
And one of the things about Dan is the agents are going to respect him. They're going to respect Kash, and they're certainly going to respect Attorney General Bondi, because they're going to lead by example, leave politics aside and stay mission focused, in line with President Trump's America First agenda. It's really -- I mean, Jesse, it's just kind of common sense.
WATTERS: Yes, and he's inspired. He's already pumping me up just listening to how dedicated he is going to take this position.
You talked about the trust. We're now hearing about this transgender sex chat room at the NSA. Ratcliffe says he's looking into it. There was actually, apparently, a CIA agent that was in this thing. You know, they're getting sex change operations, and they're bragging about it on work platforms.
Is this a National Security threat?
WALTZ: Well, it's unacceptable. I have no doubt that John Ratcliffe will clean it up and clear these people out. And again, it's about being mission focused. As we were just talking about with Dan, it's focused on career criminals, spies, and bad guys, not on parents or Catholics.
And in this case, look, we have, whether it's cyberattacks, the Chinese, the North Koreans or what have you, we've got plenty of threats abroad that should take up the entire work day and take everything we've got to keep America safe, and the new leadership that President Trump is putting in place is going to be focused on exactly that, and just get the politics and the nonsense out of our National Security community.
WATTERS: Did you put together your five bullet points of accomplishments from last week?
WALTZ: I can't talk about them, Jesse, but I can talk about this. President Trump is, I don't know, as you saw, today focused on ending the war in Russia-Ukraine, getting hostages out, 29, just since he said all hell to pay. People releasing Americans for free, not trading them for arms dealers, securing our border, going after cartels, securing the Arctic with Greenland, getting China out of the Panama Canal.
I don't know, where do you want me to stop? This is all President Trump's leadership, and we're just executing.
WATTERS: All right, it sounds like you've got a lot of bullet points there, and I don't need to know the details, and no one else does.
Thank you very much. We really appreciate you.
WALTZ: I'll tell Elon. Thanks. Yes, appreciate it.
WATTERS: Thank you so much.
Kamala and Jane Fonda, a match made in heaven.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Democrats are in deep trouble.
One big shot donor told "The Hill," "I'll be blunt here: The Democratic Party is effing terrible, plain and simple. In fact, it doesn't get much worse." Yikes.
Who's to blame for this? Well, you could start with Kamala. She lost The White House, both chambers of Congress and $2 billion in campaign cash, but hey, at least you won a participation trophy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Give us that kiss. Give us that kiss. One more.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Her acceptance speech was classic Kamala, and her message to her party was simple, keep doing whatever it is you're doing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HARRIS: Some look at this moment and rightly feel the weight of history. Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask, what do we do now? But we know exactly what to do because we have done it before, and we will do it again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And that is why Stephen A. Smith, not Kamala, is a Democrat's top option.
Then over at the SAG Awards, Hanoi Jane got on the podium and said, it is time for a revolution.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JANE FONDA, ACTRESS: Make no mistake, empathy is not weak or woke. And by the way, woke just means you give a damn about other people.
Have any of you ever watched a documentary of one of the great social movements like apartheid or our Civil Rights Movement or stone walls? We are in our documentary moment.
This is it, and it's not a rehearsal.
(APPLAUSE)
FONDA: This is it, and we mustn't for a moment, kid ourselves about what's happening.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Over in Atlanta, Mega Church pastor is mad at a group of Black Trump supporters who went to the White House. Viewer warning what you're about to hear is extra racist.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMAL HARRISON BRYANT, MINISTER AND AUTHOR: I'm afraid of the spooks that said at the door these runaway slaves hiding in the White House. I feel bad for them (bleep) in the White House who are in their tap dancing for mass, wearing bow ties (bleep) and grinding, laughing like nothing is funny.
Get out of there, Negro and stand with your people so that you understand that God is on our side.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: You can't offend people into voting Democrat again. This should be a wake-up call for the left. Bill Maher gets it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JON LOVETT, "POD SAVE AMERICA": Gender affirming care saves a lot of lives. There is a war on that group of people from the right to make salient, extreme cases, edge cases, not for the purposes of stopping those but for doing what the Trump administration is doing entirely, which is stopping all gender affirming care altogether, and making trans people (bleep) nervous when they have to pee at the airport.
BILL MAHER, HOST, "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER": You want to lose every election, just keep coming down on the side of parents coming in second in a who gets to decide what goes on with my kid contest.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Watch out, Bill, disagreeing with the left will get you booted from the party. Even celebrities like Woody Harrelson are taking note.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WOODY HARRELSON, ACTOR: I guess the progressives -- are they now the conservatives? We've got to change the term because the progressives seem a lot less progressive.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Meanwhile, over at NBC, they're DOGEing the entire lineup. Lester Holt out at the "Nightly News" and MSNBC just took an ax to a bunch of shows. Joy Reid canceled, Jonathan Capehart canceled. Remember, he's the guy who had to wake Biden up during an interview last year.
There's only one way for Democrats to avoid political extinction, they need to avoid identity politics. No more race baiting, no more pronouns, no more insanity.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANDREW SCHULZ, CO-HOST, "THE BRILLIANT IDIOTS": The problem with Democrats right now is they can't have a convo and make jokes about pronouns because they're like (bleep) that group is going to be upset. They can't have a convo and make a gay joke (bleep) because that group's going to be upset.
They can't have a convo about migrants or something like that, because (bleep) that's going to be upset. They can't have convos about anything, so they're kind of standing there neutered. They can be eloquent, they can be brilliant, they can be smart, like a Buttigieg, but they can't be relatable.
But it's over for the people, and that's one of the reasons why they voted for Trump. But it's not over for the party.
But I need a Democrat to be like yo' furries are weird.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Michael Duncan and John Ashbrook are the co-hosts of "The Ruthless Podcast."
All right, Mike, Kamala got an Image Award at the NAACP. Her image is good?
MICHAEL DUNCAN, "THE RUTHLESS PODCAST": Yes, I'm shocked by that. I subscribe to the Ricky Bobby rule politics, if you ain't first, you're last. And I don't know, when in this country did you start giving victory laps to second place?
WATTERS: I think they just do that at the NAACP Image Awards, but I've never been up for an award, so I don't know.
The Hanoi Jane speech. Could you interpret that for me, John, I had a hard time understanding what she said.
JOHN ASHBROOK, "THE RUTHLESS PODCAST": I'll tell you, Jesse, I think my mom had a workout tape from Jane Fonda back in the 80s, and my guess is that now that people have Ozempic and GLP1, they don't need the Jane Fonda workout tape anymore, so they're turning to her for other things.
And apparently she is saying, you know what Democrats need to do to win election, my guess is they don't need to listen to her.
WATTERS: They shouldn't have listened to her ever, but she does look great, and maybe the workouts are still working. Can you explain why Democrats, for instance, Mike, can't say furries are weird.
DUNCAN: They're entirely captured by their activist base and if they hope to raise any money this cycle, they're going to keep being captured by their activist base. They can't say the obvious thing.
That is why you've got Chuck Schumer has all the personality of a wet dish rag outside the CFPB holding a rally. I mean, they're shocked that people haven't opened up their wallets to donate to this party. They don't actually stand for anything. All they do is regurgitate the talking points of the radical base.
WATTERS: You know, John, Chuck Schumer is holding up an avocado. Musk is holding up a chain saw. One is more convincing.
ASHBROOK: Yes, here's the thing, Jesse, we started this segment with Kamala Harris, and Democrats appear to be ready to turn the page on her. Republicans want justice for Kamala Harris and Justice For Kamala Harris cannot happen unless she has two years to be front and center for their party.
She needs a full run for president in the United States, not just this, like three or four months they gave her. She has to be the face of their party.
WATTERS: Yes, I agree. And then she should pick Hanoi Jane as her running mate, and we will just dine out on that for the rest of our careers.
Gentlemen, you're very well dressed. You make yourselves much better looking than you actually are. Thank you so much.
Well, Johnny looks for Joe Biden in Delaware.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Surprise, he got so much done so quickly.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whatever he says out of his mouth, he is going to get done.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, people with felony, the ability to have faith again. If you could be a president with a felony, why can't I be a president with a felony?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He cleaning up. Everybody getting fired.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
BIDEN: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I've just been told I've been fired.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He didn't care how it was affecting us, how a lot of us didn't have jobs, and other johns were picking them up.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He didn't want to, but I'm glad Donald Trump is.

WATTERS: More PRIMETIME straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: So this Japanese waitress at this sushi restaurant told me she doesn't use soy sauce. I said, why not? She goes, there's too much sodium, and there's a lot of soy sauce in the sushi already, it doesn't need it, and it also kind of ruins the taste of the sushi.
I mean, this is a Japanese woman from a sushi restaurant. She knows what she's talking about. So no more soy sauce. I'm done.
Texts.

That would be good journalism.

It's a great transition from Spanish teacher to $20 million check as you leave the White House.
