The Trump Administration is demanding Ohio University and other public institutions dismantle their DEI programs by Friday or risk losing federal funding. Although a judge temporarily blocked the move, DEI-related bills are still advancing through federal and state legislatures, and the issue is expected to continue.
The ultimatum, issued by the Department of Education Feb. 14 in a "Dear Colleagues" letter, cited "divisive" concepts, such as DEI, critical race theory and social justice activism as subjects that must be eliminated to avoid violations of federal law. 
Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said the Department will no longer tolerate racial discrimination in educational institutions.
"The law is clear: treating students differently based on race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent," Trainor wrote in the memo.
At the Council of Student Leaders last week, Interim Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion Russell Morrow said the university plans to comply with the new law but stressed current programs at OU do not discriminate based on race. 
The University also issued a response Feb. 18 reaffirming its commitment to nondiscrimination. 
"Ohio University does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or other legally protected status," the university wrote in the statement. "Those involved in admission, scholarships, financial aid or conferral of other University benefits, programs or services, as well as those making hiring decisions, may not consider race, color or national origin as a factor."
Seda Feldman, a junior social work major at OU, expressed alarm about the broader impact of defunding DEI programs. She said she believes the lack of education on minority groups could fuel ignorance and discrimination in future generations. 
OU's student body is 78.7% white, with 15.7% of students from historically underrepresented groups enrolled, according to OU's Diversity Dashboard. Feldman feels these changes could potentially damage the university's reputation.
"I think the fact that the majority of our school is white is a problem in the first place," Feldman said. "If we weren't able to get those diversity numbers up while DEI programs were funded and in place, then there's no way those numbers are going to go up now that it will be defunded, and I think it's ignorant to believe it's OK."
Betsy O'Brochta, a retired Upper Arlington teacher, also raised concerns about the potential dismantling of DEI programs. O'Brochta, who taught in an informal progressive program for kindergarten through fourth grade, said DEI programs are essential to quality education and shaping the future. 
"It bothers me when (people) say 'DEI hire,' because you make the assumption that a person of color is less than, and that's not necessarily true," O'Brochta said. "This whole 'woke' business revolves around white old men."
O'Brochta also criticized the negative portrayal of DEI initiatives, explaining the phrase "DEI" has been politicized and mischaracterized. She said DEI is vital and encourages people to question which aspect detractors are truly opposed to.
"My biggest point when I talk to people and they are anti-DEI is I don't call it 'DEI,'" O'Brochta said. "I call it diversity, equity and inclusion, and I ask which piece they're against."
Around 15.5% of the students enrolled in Athens City Schools are not white, according to Niche. Superintendent Chad Springer said although the school district does not have specific DEI initiatives, he is worried partnerships for clubs and events such as Black History Month could be jeopardized.
"I think there's a lot of trepidation with some of our students who really are involved in this," Springer said. "They work with our outside groups to expand their knowledge base and to experience different experiences than what they would have just provided by the K-12 education. These experiences are offered to our students because of partnerships, and we don't want to completely deprive students of experiences, so you are going to have a large number of students affected by this."
Looking to the future, Springer said he is worried the growing trend of political polarization in educational policy will create a constant cycle of shifting regulations that will make it harder for schools to maintain consistent support systems for students.
"I've never experienced something this drastic, and my fear is every time we have an election cycle, we're going to swing from one polarization to the next," Springer said. "It's really difficult for schools to turn on a dime because then you're looking at a change of procedures, policies, practices, and when you program students to do one thing and have to change that every two years, it is very difficult on families and on staff."
