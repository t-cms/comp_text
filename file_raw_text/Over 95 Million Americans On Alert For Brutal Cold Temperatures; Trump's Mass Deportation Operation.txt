SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left for tonight. In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Greg Gutfeld, standing by, to put a smile on your face. Have a great night.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I know, I know. I am that handsome. Happy Wednesday, everyone. So America is experiencing record cold temperatures across the country. It's so cold that in DC Hunter Biden's penis got stuck to a telephone pole. Again, in New York City, perverts are applying road salt before they rub-up against you. And the big apples maniacs are resorting to pushing people in front of snow ploughs.
Yeah, I thought that was too grim too. But you never know until you try. Am I right America? Border czar Tom Homan says ICE arrested over 300 illegal migrants on Trump's first full day in office, and that was just among Joe Biden's nursing staff. The Visiting Angels are now leaving. Meanwhile, Donald Trump announced an end to all DEI in the federal government today, but thankfully, some DEI hires had cleared out their desks weeks ago.
Oh, weren't sure, were you? President Trump shared that no Joe Biden left him in the resolute desk. Think we have a shot of it here. Over at The View, Ana Navarro described the Black artist who performed at Trump's inauguration as trained seals. Then she caught a sardine with her mouth. You know, it's so cute when she balances the ball on her nose. Speaking of the inauguration, Mark Zuckerberg sat next to Lauren Sanchez, and was caught, yeah, it was caught layering at her AmpleBosom, prompting a nearby and very horny Bill Clinton to say, what an amateur.
A Turkish woman set a world record by crushing five watermelons in 60 seconds using only her thighs. Mom, well, I guess we finally figured out who killed Gallagher. According to a new study, AI can predict career success from a single facial image. On the downside, though, can also predict total failure. And snow has been dumping on states in the South, including 10 inches, in New Orleans. Of course, New Orleans has an experienced 10 inches since Tyrus left.
He has huge forearms, from all those wrist curls. OK. So Donald Trump won the Electoral College, all the swing states, and the popular vote, that's virtually every state in the nation shifted significantly to the right. So, one may wonder, what do the Dems have left? Well, they'll always have Hitler.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY (D-CONN.): What do you think of Elon Musk, perhaps the President's most visible adviser, doing two Heil Hitler salutes last night at the President's televised rally.
REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-N.Y.): No Elon Musk did not do those solutions.
MURPHY: I think that your work and the Administration's work on anti- semitism only comes with real impact and credibility if it holds both right and left accountable, and credibility comes with calling anti-semitism and anti-semitism behavior out when it comes from both the right and the left.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: And that guy is a Senator from Connecticut who knew a liquid mixture used to clean your vagina could run for office. I mean, what a douche. And so, these bozos are still doubling down on demented, building on the whole Trump's Hitler theme that helped them lose two, maybe three elections. I mean, of all the strategies they decide to hold on to after such a humiliating defeat, it's this one. So, here's your latest hoax. Elon gave a Nazi salute at the Trump inauguration.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA MOTORS: There are elections that, elections that come and go, some elections are, you know, importance or not, but this one, this one, this one really mattered, and I just want to say thank you for making it happen. Thank you. Thank you. My heart goes out to you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: OMG, he raised his harm in the air, and so in unison, the media jumped all over this, like Kevin Spacey on a boy band. Here's just a few of the outlets you got the memo. Musk offers a Nazi like salute. Sure look like a Sieg Heil to me. It's day two, and they've already showed us who they are. Now, of course, this BS no longer registers like Joy Behar's guide to personal hygiene. No one is buying it.
So why are they still doing it? Well, they have lost so much credibility that it's easier for them to lose it all than it is to earn it back. It's like when you get lost hiking, do you go back the way you came? Or do you eat your spouse? It's a good question. Or imagine you have a really fat friend who should go on a diet. The problem is, he's on death row. So really, what's the point in cutting calories? That's the media. They're dead men walking, or in this case, dead man walking, to the unemployment line.
Now, you may think that it's the fringe that's pushing this. Nope, it's the whole crazy core. PBS, aka, please be stupid, claims that must salute appeared similar to Sieg Heil. Did you notice the restraint in that? They didn't say it was a fascist salute. They said it appeared similar. That's how the left plays fair. We won't call you Hitler. We'll just say you remind us a lot of Hitler.
No wonder their ratings are lower than Jerry Nadler's balls. Now, since then, the very liberal Anti-Defamation League said, it's not a Nazi salute, and that's when AOC slammed the Jewish outfit, claiming they work for Nazis. Now, this is a good time to remember, AOC is in government because she couldn't hack it as a bartender. Apparently, when people ordered a negroni, she called them racist. But, I guess, she forgot this was her a few years ago at a rally of her own.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we will not relent to that. We will not bow down to that. We will keep fighting for a better future.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Well, if Musk is Hitler, I guess that makes her Eva Braun, but there are so many Hitlers on the left. I mean, there's Liz, there's Hillary, there's Kamala, there's Barak, I mean, the upside with all these Nazi salutes is their staff use the opportunity to spray them with deodorant. So, many Dems wonder, why is everybody leaving their party?
Well, here's your answer. How can you even relax around a liberal if they're going to link your body language to everything? You say, hey, I like to play fetch with my dog. They say, you know, who else like to do that? Hitler. Hey, would you check out my new Harley? And they'll say, you know, Mussolini loved motorbikes. You say, it's really cold. Can you spare a blanket? And they say, OK, Gaddafi. Speaking of OK, remember how they claim the OK sign was a fascist symbol, without a garage door handle was a noose, and a stray banana peel was racist?
Their filter for interpreting life is so narrow, so joyless, and vindictive that everything is potentially evil, which makes them worth avoiding at all costs. At some point, those remaining Democrats need to ask themselves a question, and it's not why so many Blacks, Whites, Hispanics and young people have fled their party, or even why your most successful Democrats have left the party as well. It's why you're still where you are.
Could it be that, like all sinking ships, you're the rats that really have nowhere else to go? No one wants you because you're so (BEEP) miserable. Maybe everyone isn't flocking to Trump. They're just running from you, and for that, we salute you. Let's welcome tonight's guests.
You can trace me back to his hotel room tonight; Fox News At Night anchor, Trace Gallagher. He stopped working through ships after too many people jumped overboard; actor, writer, comedian, Jamie Lissow. She's been talking about maternity for what feels like an eternity; New York Times bestselling author and Fox News Contributor, Kat Timpf. And he's a lot like needlepoint, old ladies want to do him on the couch; New York Times bestselling author, comedian, and former NWA World Champion, Tyrus. Trace, you're my favorite hard news guy.
TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Thank you, Greg.
GUTFELD: Because you make the news hard. All right. Why is the media repeating the same mistake that they made before the election? Is it deliberate? Is it stupid? Is it like a drug to them?
GALLAGHER: It's almost like they missing Hitler so much that they've got to kind of get back on board, right? They just can't get away from it. So, if they can't say Hitler, they got to kind of get to the next step, which is calling Elon Musk saying, he did a Hitler salute, a Nazi salute. The truth is, it's going so far that there's even more now, the NFL is making punt returners when they do the fair catch side, 15-yard penalty, you're thrown out of the game. And then, when you go to the sideline, you can't have Gatorade. You've got to eat gefilte fish.
GUTFELD: That's disgusting.
GALLAGHER: Which I think is bad. Elon Musk did not even come close to doing a Nazi sign. He said, I love you. And every time they play this, they turn the sound down. He said, I love you. And he was saying, I love you. If they -- I mean, you pointed out everybody has done this.
GUTFELD: Yes.
GALLAGHER: The athletes do it all the time.
GUTFELD: Superman.
GALLAGHER: Every time they do some Superman.
GUTFELD: The Superman is flying. If he -- if he ever puts his arms down, he dies.
GALLAGHER: Crazy. Yeah.
GUTFELD: And he's real. Jamie, as a Nazi, are you offended? Are you offended when non-Nazis steal your thunder through false accusations? You've worked very hard in the Aryan Brotherhood.
JAMIE LISSOW, ACTOR, WRITER AND COMEDIAN: This is a bit of a challenging question, Greg. We know it's, I mean, the left is grasping at straws, and Biden needs those straws to eat his meals. That's the problem is, what you said Trace like, you have to take the context of it like, obviously he, I think he's really excited. Remember, he was jumping up and down? I think Elon's just sort of an excitable guy that maybe does some wacky things sometimes, because he's excited. He says -- he said, my heart goes out to you or something before this, which I don't speak German, but I don't think that's what Hitler was yelling.
GUTFELD: No.
LISSOW: Right? But he was yelling that stuff, and like you, I just feel like there's such a, you need the words, like, look at the difference between like hell Hitler and like taxi, yeah, right? Hail taxi is very different than Hail Hitler, right.
GUTFELD: That's true.
LISSOW: I say leave, leave Elon alone. Elon's like a -- like a kid in a candy store that knows exactly how many pieces of candy are in it.
GUTFELD: Yeah, it's true. Exactly, when he's in front of crowds, it's, you never know what's going to happen. Kat, what do you think is behind this? Are they just -- are they, like Jamie says, pretty much out of straws to grasp?
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, I think so. And I think that also, once one person says it, they feel like you have to say it too, or else, then you are also a Nazi. So, it's like a weird telephone game, but the ADL, I mean, for the ADL to come out and say that, the -- if you follow the ADL, it wasn't that long ago that Elon was, I believe, threatening to sue them.
GUTFELD: Exactly.
TIMPF: Because they were accusing him suggesting that he was anti-semitic for not doing enough to combat anti-semitism on, I think it was still even called Twitter then, and if they're like, no, so now you're going after them, it's like they are, this just makes no sense. He got too excited. And also, he said that, no, I wasn't doing that. So, if he was going to be so bold as to go out in front of this crowd and do a Nazi salute, I feel like you would also be so bold as to say that that's what you did.
GUTFELD: Exactly. Why would you deny it?
TIMPF: Yeah, well, what you don't, like, you're the richest man in the world.
GUTFELD: Yes, if anybody's going to be a Nazi, I mean, he has Nazi FU money.
LISSOW: He does.
TIMPF: He does.
GEORGE "TYRUS" MURDOCH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He could literally go bury up Hitler's dead body, take his arm off and do it with him, because that's how much money he has.
GUTFELD: Does it bother you that we're actually even talking about this?
TYRUS: No, it bothers me that everyone is just too much in love with Elon. Listen, he's a genius and he has a lot of money, but he's not athletic. You can't have it all. He was trying to have a Wolf of Wall Street moment, but he has zero rhythm. He jumped when he should have stopped. He's embarrassed. He looked like a goose who thought he could fly, but his mom was like, you're not quite ready yet.
And that's what he was doing. He was so excited. He's not used to being in front of crowds unless he can fire them, so this is new for him. But the serious side is, Greg, you have to stop making excuses. This is who they are. If -- if you are a racist person, and you're been giving the opportunity to show yourself every day, you're not going to change. If a man is going to not be -- if a man is -- abuses his wife and his kids, and they tell him, hey, you're not going to go to jail anymore. You're not going to lose your job anymore, he no longer will have good moments.
Every time someone says something like, she's going to hit him, he's going to call him a name, because it has been their bosses. I guarantee you, they got two thumbs up or two hails when they came through the thing, because this is who they are. They're not going to change. This is who they've always been, but they've used President Trump and that narrative to show who they are. So be wary, because this is who they are.
GUTFELD: This is who they are. Tonight at 9. All right, up next, he stayed silent in the pew, then gave her a bad review.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Thank you. She used her sermon to treat us like vermin. Our Video of The Day comes from the National Prayer Service where Episcopalian Bishop, Mariann Budde, Budde, typical priest, used her priestly pulpit to lecture Trump about the evils of his new administration. Roll it, Gladys.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARIANN EDGAR BUDDE, AMERICAN PRELATE OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH: I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country. We're scared now. There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives. The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Oh, they do our dishes. Well, that was infantile, but you know, she kind of looks familiar to me. Was she once a news reporter for WKRP in Cincinnati? She later went on CNN to explain herself.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUDDE: I was looking at the President because I was speaking directly to him. I was also, frankly, as you do in every sermon, speaking to everyone who was listening through that one on one conversation with the President, reminding us all that in the people that are frightened in our country, the two groups of people that I mentioned are our fellow human beings, and that they have been portrayed in all throughout the political campaign, in the harshest of lights.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Harshest of lights? I've seen more attractive bishops on a chessboard. What did Trump think of this speech?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES: What did you think? Did you like it? Did you find it exciting? Not too exciting. Was it? I didn't think it was a good service though. They could do much better.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: You know, Trump has changed. I mean, he didn't even call her ugly, so, to start. But if she wants to push lefty talking points from the pulpit, just wait a few weeks. Save it for Joe Biden's eulogy. Oh, whoa, we're all going to die. Jamie, so trans kids are in danger. I don't think any of them were shot in the head like the person she is basically admonishing.
LISSOW: Yeah, that's a good point. I was confused at a lot of stuff. She was like, I had a one-on-one conversation with him and everybody. And like, I don't know if it's -- I don't think he got to talk back. So, I don't know how it's -- she said she's Episcopalian. I don't know. I think that's you worship Joe Piscopo. It's -- is that what that is?
GUTFELD: Yeah, I think you're right.
LISSOW: I know Lutheran is, you worship Luther Vandross, but I wasn't sure about it, because I think Bishop should only be allowed to move diagonally. If -- if, no matter what side of politics you're on, it was boring. There was one point I saw that Jesus on the Cross Statue peek at his watch, and I go, this is -- in all seriousness, she brings up, like, a passage in the Bible where she kind of says, like, you know, God teaches us to be merciful to the stranger, and but that maybe I don't think God was talking about, like, vans with tinted windows and stranger danger, and all these things.
Like, I mean, it's a we -- we kind of tried that, right, with immigration, and there's been some problems with it, and that's why, like, thing, things that have to be done. I just felt like there's -- and also there's, there's, like, a time and a place for something like that, right? There's a time and a place, two things Biden's never sure of, but I felt like, I just felt like it was, like an I felt like it was, for sure, an inappropriate time to do something like that, and if nothing else, kind of confusing and kind of like there's many, many ways to interpret the Bible. And I thought that was a, kind of like a narrow way to do it.
GUTFELD: Yeah, I think the thing is, I mean, maybe, you know, you think about all the victims, Kat, of illegal immigrants, or the fact that legal immigrants are against illegal immigration, because they waited in line, you know?
TIMPF: OK, so the way that he handled it, he didn't get in any of that. I think that he didn't get into any of the content of anything she said. He didn't say, well, actually, how could you say this with so and so did this. He just said, you were boring, which I think she wanted to have a debate of some kind. I think everybody sat there, and she -- I think she wanted to get a rise out of him. I think that she wanted to kind of go there. And the best way, I think, really, to handle somebody who's trying to upset you is to just say that all your insults weren't that exciting. That, that, like that was a, I would say that was a masterful move.
GUTFELD: Tyrus, you know, she didn't call him a Nazi. So, that's --
TYRUS: Well, anytime someone asked me to go to church, I'll just break this little gem out not, but putting up with that. I'm good. I'm going to watch the game. This is the problem with activists. She's an activist, and she was pretending to be a person of God, to be an activist, to sit there and say that there was -- there was gay and lesbian, and transgender children afraid. The only reason why they're afraid is because of your rhetoric.
You're the ones who say that the Boogeyman is coming to get you. You're the ones to say they're going to put you in camps. Trust me, the one thing that Trump can't do is keep a secret. You know, what I'm saying? If he had plans, as soon as he -- that inauguration speech would have been way different, you know, and you would have seen all these guys with nets and, you know, just showing up, anybody with a rainbow get them.
Like it's just stupid, it's stupid. Your parents used to do this to us. Don't look under the bed, there's a Boogeyman, he's going to get you. That's why you have to stay in bed. There's a Boogeyman, there's a Boogeyman, there's a Boogeyman, and it's all well and fine, until I finally looked under the bed, and it wasn't a Boogeyman. It was her boyfriend. And I beat the hell out of him. But, I never afraid of the Boogeyman after that.
So, but that's what they do. She is responsible. The activists are the problem. They're the one trying to convince us, because the idea that that lesbians and gays and trans people didn't vote for President Trump, you are a (BEEP) if you don't think that's true, they did in big numbers.
GUTFELD: Yeah. You know. Jamie and Tyrus, both, there's -- there's something about the activist doesn't know time or place. They believe that you have to be self-actualized even when you're ordering coffee at Starbucks. It's like, I am an activist all the time, including when I'm in mass, which is always that, I think that's the WOKE virus at its worst.
GALLAGHER: Yeah, and Trump was set up. I mean, this was not the time nor the place. Trump was set up, the Cathedral knew this was going to happen, because this bishop has done this many --
GUTFELD: Shouldn't they have vetted it better.
GALLAGHER: -- times. They should have been -- they should have been vetted, they should have been -- they should have notified the Trump family. They should have notified other people. We had Lorenzo Sewell on who was, by the way, the Black pastor who gave the benediction at the inauguration, who was wonderful. He was in the mass, and he was appalled. He said, this is not the time. It is not the place for you to bring up politics. And when you say it's a debate, you know he does not have any power to debate back. Maybe at some point in time, he will, but he doesn't have -- that's not the right place to do that authority. It's not proper.
GUTFELD: Well, I think tomorrow we're going to have Joe Piscopo on live to talk about it, is he upset that his -- that his own church has acted so dishonestly?
TYRUS: You're going to need an extra chair for his hair piece.
GUTFELD: I think it's a weave.
LISSOW: Hey, Greg, I have a question. Why you know activists look like they're active?
GUTFELD: That is a good point.
TYRUS: Too busy fighting the cause.
GUTFELD: All right. Up next, Trump says bye-bye to DEI.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A story in five words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: It's official, DEI is dead. Kat, President Donald Trump ordered all government DEI staff to be put on paid leave. What does that mean? They're still getting paid! But he signed an executive order on Monday demolishing all federal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. So is America finally a meritocracy again?
TIMPF: Paid leave doesn't sound that bad.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You're going to go on paid leave in about two week.
TIMPF: I can't wait for mine. Yes, any day now.
I mean, honestly, I don't have disdain for DEI specifically. I have disdain for government waste overall. And it is not disputable that so many of these programs do not help anything, and in many cases make things worse. So why are we still spending money to pay these people? It shouldn't be controversial when you put it that way. It really shouldn't be controversial. If it's not doing any good and in many cases doing poorly, why are you forcibly taking money from us, which is what taxes are, to pay for these people? They should be -- we should get rid of government waste overall, and this is waste at best. It really shouldn't be controversial.
GUTFELD: So what do you think, Tyrus? It is --
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Kat is alluding to research that shows that DEI actually creates more division than unity.
TYRUS: Yes, it does. It pisses everybody off, especially if the person that they picked is the same color as you and he is a -- moron, because you are like, well, there goes my shot.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: The last guy we hired ate crayons all day instead of telling the weather, Tyrus. Thanks, DEI. I think as a guy who has been sent on paid leave before, there is a timeline of it. And the scariest thing is when they don't give you a timeline. They are just waiting for the news cycle. So the layoff will probably be on Monday. Now, typically, we call it severance if you want to be cool about it. In the WWE when they gave me paid leave, I got 90 days. And I needed that because I needed to find a -- job.
So what he's doing is giving them, I think -- but you can't give them 90 days, because they couldn't get this job. So they are going to try to get another DEI job, and there's none out there. So you might as well just pull the plug now, because you don't get used to paying your bills until you educate yourself and start doing hard work.
GUTFELD: It's true, there's going to will be no DEI left.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Trace, as we know, FOX originally had in place DEI for hot dudes. That is how you got in here.
(LAUGHTER)
GALLAGHER: Yes, many years ago.
GUTFELD: No, no, no, you're still a DILF.
GALLAGHER: A DILF?
TYRUS: Never mind.
GUTFELD: Do you fear you might be fired now that we've gotten rid of DEI for hot dudes?
GALLAGHER: Yes, me and a lot of others are going. Listen, DEI was nothing more than a race to mediocrity. You're right, it creates division, it strives toward mediocrity. And did you notice the executive order? It's not just DEI anymore. Now it's DEI. It's diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility. And you're like, when did they add -- they keep adding letters?
GUTFELD: Yes.
GALLAGHER: And my thing is why not just make it DEI-AAA, that way the slogan can be yes, you lose your job, but you still get roadside assistance.
(LAUGHTER)
GALLAGHER: I think it's one of those things where you have to let people reach their equilibrium. You cannot force things, and we have been forcing it for so long. The country is fed up and they want it to be gone.
GUTFELD: Yes. You can't --
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Diversity is great, but you have to lead with competence or merit first. Jamie, will this end of DEI affect your career? Meaning, will you finally have one?
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: Trace did just remind me of my career when he said race to mediocrity.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: I think this is all really great news. Paid leave, though, the phrase "paid leave", it does remind me of my divorce, because I paid her and she left.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
LISSOW: As Tyrus was talking, I realized that I don't think I have ever had a real job. Because he was like paid leave, severance. And I'm like, what are those? Because you have to have like a good job, I think, to get -- because it's kind of a win-win, right? You're going to --
TYRUS: Or you're six-eight and your manager is five-two. We're going to give you two week's pay.
LISSOW: Is that right? OK, I got the same thing, but it's five-seven and five-seven. I do think, though, isn't paid leave almost like a win-win? Like, you're getting paid and you're not. It's almost like -- did you ever get suspended from school? Detention sucked, but suspension, they were like, hey, you've got to leave, and you were like, I would like to leave.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: We are all winning. But I'm just thinking about, at least he is giving them those perks and getting us what we want. Because I don't know what severance is --
GUTFELD: You've never had a real job?
LISSOW: I don't think I've ever had paid retirement or paid leave or any of this stuff. I'll tell you what about retirement, if I die tomorrow, Greg, I will have saved the exact right amount of money.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You know what, you should die tomorrow to achieve that goal.
LISSOW: OK.
(BOOS)
GUTFELD: I apologize. I'm sorry. I'm not really sorry.
TIMPF: You just told him to die!
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: So you can die a mediocrity.
LISSOW: And for some reason I was like, OK.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Coming up, a refreshing story about old glory.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: That's a great rhyme.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five more words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: All right, the American flag flies alone. Where are my notes? I have to read this. All right, where am I, Tyrus? OK, the Trump State Department has implemented a one flag policy barring U.S. outposts from hoisting pride and Black Lives Matter flags and allowing only the American flag to be flown at embassies.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: What do you say to that?
TYRUS: No --
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: It should have never been any other way. It's the United States of America. Our flag should stand alone. That's it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Trace, doesn't this make it easier, kind of for everyone? You eliminate the argument, no, you can't put up a Ukraine flag, you can't put up a rainbow flag. There's no choice except the red, white, and blue. And everyone kind of goes, it's like dad's home and says no, you're not doing this. And everybody is kind of relieved.
GALLAGHER: It's a continuation of the DEI argument which is that no matter how many flags you put up, you are still not going to be totally inclusive. You're leaving somebody out. So you can put every flag up there you want, and somebody is going to be left out. So you put the flag that is inclusive to everyone, which is the American flag. That's the way it works.
(APPLAUSE)
GALLAGHER: That gets everyone in, because you know in the south, if you put up all of the flags, you're still at the very bottom going to have to have "It's 5:00 Somewhere" flag. That's just the way it is. So you have to keep putting up flags to placate the masses, and you're never going to placate them. So just have one that we can all respect.
TIMPF: Do you ever see -- not embassies, I'm not talking about those. Do you ever see anyone's Twitter or Instagram bio where you can tell they're in too deep with the flags?
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: They'll have, like, they have the pride flag, and then they'll have #BLM, and then they'll the Ukrainian flag. And then they'll have -- at some point they took the hashtag "Stay home save lives" out, but you don't know when they did that. They had the stop the spread -- it's like, once you start, you can't stop, I feel like.
TYRUS: They can't even put their name on their Twitter panel. It's all flags.
TIMPF: Yes, and you see people, oh, you're in too deep with the flags.
GUTFELD: That's the same person that has the sign on their lawn, this is my neighborhood, that has all of the things they believe. You know what sign I'm talking about? It has got like, I believe in science.
GALLAGHER: Hate has no home here.
GUTFELD: Hate has no home. Yes, it's amazing.
TYRUS: That's like a helpful tip for who not to meet.
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly.
TIMPF: The mask emoji.
GUTFELD: They have the worst candy on Halloween.
So Jamie, I know you don't have a home to raise a flag, but what are you going to do with all of your flags now?
LISSOW: I'm going to put a flag on the intent of the car I live in.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: Of course there should be one flag, right? It's the United States of America. This makes almost too much sense. And my uncle, he was really upset when they did that regular flag and then the pride flag underneath it. He is very -- he is so excited today. He gets mad at the sky when there is a rainbow.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: After a storm. And I get it. I get that the pride flag is important to some, and it adds significance. It demonstrates all the different colors your hair can be to be a part of the community.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: And --
GUTFELD: Yes? Keep going.
TYRUS: Keep going!
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I want to see how far you will get yourself. Come on, I know there's something in there.
LISSOW: I haven't seen the guy that owns the U.S. flag store near my house this excited since 9/12.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: Well played. We asked him.
GUTFELD: I knew there was one in there that you just were like, do I do it. You had the look on your face, Jamie, and I had to pull it out of you.
TYRUS: In case of emergency, break glass.
(LAUGHTER)
GALLAGHER: He had the comeback because he has already said he has no money. No money, he's like I'm going to stop now, and I have to redeem myself.
TYRUS: That just got him some bookings.
GUTFELD: All right, we've got to go to the next segment. If spelling makes you nauseous, don't seek public office.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you got an idiot as your city's mayor, it's time for a shot and a little chaser.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: That was fun. The city has gone to hell and their mayor can't even spell. Welcome to a "Shot, Chaser," a new segment to help you take the edge off. First up, the shot. Philadelphia's woke liberal Mayor Cherelle Parker. She is famous for pushing DEI in one of America's top crime-ridden, Democrat-run cities. The chaser, watching her at a recent news conference trying to spell the name of her city's football team.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MAYOR CHERELLE PARKER, (D) PHILADELPHIA: Let me hear you all say, E-L-G-S- E-S, Eagles. Let's go birds!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Let's, let's go Elgses, let's go Elgses. Let's got birds, B-E-R-D- Z! Birds. Trace, I think the upside here is that she didn't try to spell Philadelphia.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: She would start with the "F."
(LAUGHTER)
GALLAGHER: This is how the Redskins became the Commanders, this whole thing. Because somebody started misspelling the Redskins, that's offensive. Let's make them the commanders. You're going to see the Elgses, next year it'll be the Philadelphia Elgses, because the Elgses don't offend anybody at all.
GUTFELD: Elgses, how hard is it to spell "Eagles"? Jamie, I mean, when you learn how to spell "Eagles"? You learn that, what, in fifth, fourth grade?
LISSOW: Yes, I'll probably learn it soon.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: Elgses -- I've never seen somebody misspell something that quickly and then commit to it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: She just committed to it. It's Eagle. It's not Elgses. Being the mayor of a place and not being able to spell the name of your home team should be completely Elgses.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I wonder if she was -- maybe she was a little drunk.
LISSOW: Yes, then somebody goes you don't know how to spell. And she goes, hey, F-W. And she gave them the index finger.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Tyrus, you know what bugs me? This is so unfair to the fine people of Philadelphia, who are already viewed as stupid.
TYRUS: The hell with them. This goes back to what I was talking about. Now I can't run for mayor of Philadelphia because as soon as I walk in there's going to be a spelling test. It's not fair.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: And what really makes me upset is that she has the speech written down! You can see it right there! And she is outside Eagles stadium. All you had to do was look up!
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: The guy behind her -- if she just did a -- if you pulled a Jamie Lissow who can't remember any of his -- jokes, he has got his little paper, and he's like, hey guys, did I tell you the one about 9/12? He has it written down!
TIMPF: Were you nervous you're going to get the year wrong?
LISSOW: Yes. I've been nervous the whole night.
TYRUS: But this is exactly why I can't stand when DEI is black. Be Mexican or white or Asian. The next time I walk into a job interview, the first thing they're going to do is, hey, this is standard. We're going to give you a spelling test, and then I'll have to take a spelling test on things like "eagles," "bird," "Philadelphia".
GUTFELD: Kat, does this underline the stereotype that women are bad spellers?
(BOOS)
GUTFELD: Shut up!
TIMPF: That's not even, that's not even an accurate stereotype --
GUTFELD: I know! I know!
TIMPF: You're not even being a bigot correctly!
GUTFELD: They all win the spelling bees.
TIMPF: People say women are good at -- have higher linguist intelligence.
Anyway, this is a metaphor, I think, for government in general about just being wrong but doing it so loudly and confidently with a smile on your face so that nobody notices.
GUTFELD: She has a master's from the University of Pennsylvania. What does that say about the University of Pennsylvania?
TYRUS: They don't have spelling tests.
GUTFELD: Yes, they don't.
LISSOW: Greg, I heard she went to business school and got her MDA.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, we're going to move on. We'll be right back.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Trace Gallagher, Jamie Lissow, Kat Timpf, Tyrus, our studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
