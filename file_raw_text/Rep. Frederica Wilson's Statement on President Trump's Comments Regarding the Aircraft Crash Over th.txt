Today, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, Senior Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and a member of the Aviation Subcommittee, released the following statement on President Trump's Comments Regarding the Aircraft Crash over the Potomac River:
"While human bodies are still being pulled from the Potomac, Donald Trump is blaming white women and minorities for the deadly crash under the guise of DEI. We should all expect our President to lead us with sympathy and compassion during a monumental tragedy such as a fatal airline crash that claimed 67 lives.
"Instead, he is lambasting armed services personnel, pilots and air traffic controllers for a crash that is unprecedented and is still under investigation. The response from the White House lacks leadership; it's abysmal and sickening."
The night of the crash, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson expressed her condolences and prayers regarding the situation.
