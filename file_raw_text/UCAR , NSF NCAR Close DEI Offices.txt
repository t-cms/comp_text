The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) have closed their offices that engaged in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work, effective today, January 24, 2025, at 8:40 a.m. Mountain Time. The staff in those offices have been placed on paid administrative leave, and all of the organization's DEI-related work has been ended.
This action ensures the organization, as a federal contractor and an NSF federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), is in compliance with President Trump's executive orders.
As always, UCAR and NSF NCAR will continue the research needed to improve the understanding and prediction of the Earth system and related natural hazards in a way that protects lives and property and supports economic growth and national security.
