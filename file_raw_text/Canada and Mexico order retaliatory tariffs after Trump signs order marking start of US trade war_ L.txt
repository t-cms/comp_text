Mexico and Canada order retaliatory messages in trade war with US

Mexico and Canada have ordered retaliatory measures against the US after President Donald Trump placed sweeping tariffs on goods from its two neighbours and China.
Mr Trump posted on social media that the tariffs are necessary "to protect Americans", pressing the three nations to do more to curb the manufacture and export of illicit fentanyl and for Canada and Mexico to reduce illegal immigration into the US.
The action fulfilled one of Mr Trump's commitments to voters, but threw the global economy and his political mandate to lower prices into turmoil.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in response that Canadian duties on 30 billion dollars (£24 billion) worth of trade in American alcohol and fruit will take effect on Tuesday when the US tariffs begin.
He opened his address to Canadians with a message aimed at American consumers.
"It will have real consequences for you, the American people," he said, saying it will result in higher prices on groceries and other goods.
Mr Trudeau channelled the views of many Canadians feeling betrayed by their neighbour and long-time ally, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan.
"The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together," Mr Trudeau said, warning in French that it could bring about "dark times" for many people.

Yet today, protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism, a fig leaf for those unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the resolve to stand up to real enemies - countries that would use violence against us or our allies. Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogs who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends - weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world -- all while cynically waving the American flag.

Judge blocks Trump from freezing federal funding
Friday 31 January 2025 23:00
,
Reuters
A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from freezing federal grants, loans, and other financial assistance at the urging of Democratic state attorneys general who said it would jeopardize critical government-funded services.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, came at the behest of Democratic attorneys generals from 22 states and the District of Columbia and despite the White House saying it was rescinding Monday's memo from its budget office detailing the policy.
McConnell said evidence showed the policy remained in effect despite the rescission of the Office of Management and Budget's "wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and ambiguous" directive, which he said was in "name-only" and possibly done to frustrate a legal challenge.
New York Attorney General Letitia James, who helped lead the litigation, hailed the decision, saying it would "block the White House's chaotic pause on federal funding."
McConnell issued a temporary restraining order preventing the administration from pausing assistance to the states and barred the Trump administration for reissuing the OMB directive under any other name.
The order, which is in effect pending a further ruling from McConnell, comes after a judge in Washington, D.C., issued a shorter administrative stay pausing the policy in response to a separate legal challenge by several nonprofit groups. A hearing in the Washington case is scheduled for Monday.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
