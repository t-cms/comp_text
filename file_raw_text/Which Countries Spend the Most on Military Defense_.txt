The debate over U.S. defense spending has intensified as the Pentagon faces proposed budget cuts under the Trump administration. Secretary of Defense  has reportedly circulated a list of high-ranking officers who could be removed, many of whom have championed diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
An internal mandate from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has instructed the military to propose an  over the next five years. This directive could lead to widespread layoffs of civilian  employees and the potential restructuring of military leadership.
Hegseth has openly criticized current defense policies, arguing that military spending should prioritize combat readiness rather than what he calls "woke" initiatives.
"First of all, you've got to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. But any general that was involved—general, admiral, whatever—that was involved in any of the DEI woke s*** has got to go. Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about,"  on The Shawn Ryan Show.
As the U.S. government debates the future of its defense spending, a broader question emerges: How much does the U.S. spend compared to other countries, and where does it stand globally?
How Much Does the U.S. Spend on Defense?
The United States continues to lead the world in military expenditures. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), U.S. defense spending reached $916 billion in 2023, an increase of 2.3 percent from the previous year. This represents 68 percent of total  military spending and accounts for 37 percent of total global military expenditure.
Military spending in the U.S. encompasses a wide range of expenditures, including salaries, operational costs, arms procurement, research and development, and overseas military operations. The World Population Review estimates that the U.S. spends more on defense than the next nine highest-spending countries combined. Additionally, per capita military spending in the U.S. is $2,350, far exceeding that of most nations.
The ongoing debate in Washington raises concerns about whether this level of spending is necessary or whether resources should be redirected to other national priorities.
How Has This Changed Over Time?
U.S. military spending has fluctuated significantly over the years, often driven by geopolitical events and national security concerns. According to SIPRI, global military spending has risen for nine consecutive years, reaching an all-time high of $2443 billion in 2023. This growth is largely attributed to increased defense budgets resulting from conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.
Historically, U.S. defense spending peaked during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, with military budgets exceeding $900 billion annually in the early 2010s. After a brief decline, spending began rising again in response to new security threats, including China's growing military presence in the Pacific and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Notably, while the U.S. remains the dominant global military spender, other nations have significantly increased their defense budgets. China's military expenditure has increased for 29 consecutive years, reaching $296 billion in 2023, while Russia's spending grew by 24 percent in the same year to $109 billion. These increases have led some U.S. policymakers to argue that any significant reduction in American defense spending could weaken the country's strategic advantage.
Which Countries Spend the Most on Defense?
Beyond the United States, several nations allocate substantial resources to their military budgets. According to the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database, the top 10 military spenders in 2023 were:
United States - $916 billionChina - $296 billionRussia - $109 billionIndia - $83.6 billionSaudi Arabia - $75.8 billionUnited Kingdom - $74.9 billionGermany - $66.8 billionUkraine - $64.8 billionFrance - $61.3 billionJapan - $50.2 billion
China, the world's second-largest military spender, has been steadily increasing its defense budget, reflecting its efforts to modernize the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and . Neighboring countries such as Japan and  in response to China's military expansion, with Japan increasing its budget by 11 percent in 2023 to $50.2 billion.
Russia's military spending surged following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, accounting for 16 percent of total Russian government expenditures. Ukraine allocated 37 percent of its total government budget to military spending in 2023, a higher percentage than any other country.
The Middle East has also seen significant defense budget increases, with Saudi Arabia and Israel making substantial investments in military technology amid regional instability.
