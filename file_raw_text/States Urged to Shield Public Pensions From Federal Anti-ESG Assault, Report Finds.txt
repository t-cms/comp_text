WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 -- A report released in January 2025 by Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF), titled "Roadmap to Protect Public Pensions: How States Can Fight Back Against Federal Attacks," warns that state and local public pensions face escalating threats from an incoming federal administration poised to undermine their investment autonomy. Authored by Natalia Renta with research support from Meron Lemmi, and edited by Patrick Woodall, Lisa Donner, and Alex Martin, the report details how a burgeoning anti-ESG (environmental, social, governance) campaign--backed by fossil fuel and corporate interests--aims to dismantle pensions' ability to safeguard $5.3 trillion in assets for 12 million retirees and 14.9 million workers. It offers states a battle plan to counter these attacks and secure retirement funds vital to local economies.
The report frames public pensions as economic linchpins, distributing $334 billion annually and supporting 3.7 million jobs, $710 billion in output, and $86 billion in taxes. Yet, it warns of a federal onslaught expected under a new Trump administration and Republican Congress, echoing Project 2025's deregulatory blueprint and prior House bills like H.R. 5339. These moves threaten to reverse Biden-era rules allowing pensions to weigh environmental and social factors, replacing them with restrictive 2020 Trump-era limits. Anti-ESG efforts, already enacted in 17 states via 19 laws, cast doubt on considering climate risks--projected to devalue real estate by $121-$237 billion--or social factors like labor rights, despite evidence linking them to financial stability. The report cites Florida's pecuniary-only law and Montana's ESG ban as examples sowing legal confusion for fiduciaries.
State action is the antidote, AFREF argues. With pensions governed by state law, legislatures and officials can affirm their right to assess ESG risks, mirroring Biden's 2022 DOL rule, through statutes or attorney general opinions. The report highlights opportunities to reclaim pensions' shareholder voice--silenced by federal and state curbs on proxy voting--urging funds to define voting criteria on climate, equity, and labor issues. It also tackles financial deregulation risks, like weakened SEC climate disclosures, proposing state-mandated reporting akin to California's laws. In private markets, where pensions hold a third of private equity capital, states can demand transparency from advisers, drawing on derailed SEC rules for quarterly fee reports and audits.
The anti-ESG push also targets asset managers like BlackRock, managing vast pension index funds. The report notes their 22% S&P 500 stake often backs short-term corporate gambles over long-term stability--exacerbated by state divestments like Florida's $2 billion BlackRock pullout. Pensions can counter this by managing funds in-house or reclaiming voting rights, while leveraging client clout to steer managers toward sustainability. States like Illinois and New Mexico exemplify DEI integration, with policies boosting diverse fund managers to enhance returns and equity.
AFREF's roadmap isn't just defense--it's a call to wield pensions' $5.3 trillion as a force for workers and communities. Facing a federal rollback of safeguards, states must act decisively, codifying ESG and DEI principles to protect retirement security and economic vitality. With $400 billion added to GDP yearly, the stakes are clear: pensions must resist being pawns in a corporate-driven agenda and instead champion a just, sustainable future.
