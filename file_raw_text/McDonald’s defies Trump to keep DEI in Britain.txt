Highlight: Fast food chain breaks with US parent as it pushes ahead with commitment to diversity policies
Body


The British arm of McDonald’s is clinging to its corporate diversity policies,   in apparent defiance of Donald Trump.
The company will push forward with a swathe of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the UK, despite its Chicago-headquartered parent company watering down US DEI policies before Mr Trump took office last month.
McDonald’s US business said in January that it would abandon targets to get minorities into senior roles, rename its diversity team its “global inclusion team” and ditch DEI requirements for suppliers in America.
The company claimed the decision was influenced by a recent Supreme Court ruling on so-called affirmative action policies on American university campuses, and the changing policies of other companies.
The prospect that its UK business could follow suit triggered calls from the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU), which represents workers in the food industry, for McDonald’s to “reject attempts to mirror the regressive actions of its US counterpart” in dismantling DEI initiatives.
McDonald’s DEI pledges in the UK include ensuring that 40pc of senior leadership roles are held by people from under-represented groups by 2030 and a commitment with its suppliers to advance “social inclusion”. These will remain in place.
It follows a similar US-UK split at the auditor Deloitte. Richard Houston, Deloitte’s UK boss, told staff in a letter last month it would remain “committed to diversity goals” and “will continue to report annually on our progress on inclusion”.
McDonald’s UK business has spent years dealing with claims from workers who have said they faced bullying and sexual harassment in its restaurants.
A separate scandal in 2019 emerged when  was fired after it was revealed he had conducted a relationship with a member of staff.
Before taking office, Mr Trump suggested he would launch a clampdown on corporate diversity, claiming last year that he had put together a list of so-called “woke companies” that would be published.
The likes of Walmart, John Deere and Harley-Davidson have all abandoned DEI policies as corporate America attunes itself to the country’s ascendant political Right.
DEI has become a flashpoint for debate in the culture wars. Advocates of DEI in the workplace argue that diverse hiring and greater representation of women and minorities improves business performance.
A spokesman for the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for women’s rights, said: “Rolling back on DEI initiatives is a mistake and what’s going on in the US is a warning shot across the bow of our economy.
“Hard-won gains are easily lost and the UK simply mustn’t import the toxic notion that DEI is red tape or something to be tackled.”
However, critics argue that the push for corporate diversity has shifted companies away from meritocracy and can itself be discriminatory. High-profile opponents have included Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, who has repeatedly railed against DEI policies.
The DEI movement has found enemies in the Labour Party too.
This month, Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, claimed there were “some really daft things being done in the name of equality, diversity and inclusion” in the NHS, arguing attempts to tackle the real effects of inequality were being sidelined in favour of “ideological hobby horses”.
McDonald’s declined to comment.
