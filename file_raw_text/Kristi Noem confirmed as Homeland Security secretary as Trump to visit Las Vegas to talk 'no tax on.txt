VOICES: Freezing aid to Ukraine shows Trump is no ally to the West

Sam Kiley
Donald Trump said he was going to do it. His foreign policy and his defence team gave due warning that they'd do it. And yet, as Marco Rubio smashed a fist into the solar plexus of an already battered Ukraine, there's still stunned surprise.
In a memo sent to embassies and agencies who rely on US funding, to a tune of $72 billion at last count, the new US secretary of state ordered a stop order on American world wide aid funding for up to 90 days.
Excluded from this move are Israel and Egypt. They're fine.
Ukraine is a democracy that's been identified by the highest court on the planet, the Internmational Criminal Court, as being the victim of war crimes. But aid from the US, both civilian and military, appears to have been cut overnight with the sweep of a pen.

Trump's stance on FEMA comes from Project 2025
14:00
,
Oliver O'Connell
With President Donald Trump promising a serious overhaul of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or completely "getting rid of it," you might wonder where this idea came from...
Here's what it says on , published by the Heritage Foundation:
The bloated DHS bureaucracy and budget, along with the wrong priorities, provide real opportunities for a conservative Administration to cut billions in spending and limit government's role in Americans' lives. These opportunities include privatizing TSA screening and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program, reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government, eliminating most of DHS's grant programs, and removing all unions in the department for national security purposes.
Project 2025 also suggests that FEMA be moved from the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of the Interior, or if combined with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in the Department of Transportation (p. 134).

Trump's FEMA executive order will create task force on future of agency, report says

Oliver O'Connell
According to details , President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Friday that takes the first step toward potentially reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency by creating a task force to review it and recommend changes.
The order establishes a group called the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, whose members will include the secretaries of homeland security and defense, along with private-sector subject matter experts. The task force will be directed to issue a report to Trump on how the federal disaster response agency currently operates and ultimately recommend changes-potentially reorganizing or eliminating FEMA.
Trump has expressed a desire for states to take more control of disaster responses within their borders. For instance, White House officials have highlighted Florida, which played a significant role in managing the aftermath of Hurricane Ian.
A White House official confirmed to Semafor that Trump is expected to sign the directive later today during his multi-state cross-country trip from North Carolina to California and on to Nevada.

Trump says OPEC+ can end the bloodshed in Ukraine by cutting oil prices
11:30

Oliver O'Connell
The president continued to make the case that reducing oil revenue is the key to finding an endgame in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.
In his first days in office, Trump has focused on the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries, arguing that it has kept the price of oil too high for much of the nearly three-year war. Oil revenue is the engine driving the Russian economy.
"One way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money. And they drop the price of oil because they have it nice and high," Trump told reporters during a visit to Western North Carolina on Friday. "And if you have it high, then that war is not going to end so easily. So, OPEC ought to get on the ball and drop the price of oil. And that war will stop right away."
Watch that moment here:
Trump: "We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil, and that will automatically stop the tragedy that's taking place in Ukraine."

Trump's decision to re-implement the Mexico City Policy, also known as the "Global Gag Rule" means that all international organizations supported by federal agencies can no longer support abortion care.

It prevents any foreign organizations that receive U.S. global health assistance from "providing information, referrals, or services for legal abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country - even with their own money", according to the .
Setting this policy in place meant that education and safe practices in foreign countries, as well as abortion services through U.S. aid, became prohibited.
Dr. Alvaro Bermejo, the Director General for the International Planned Parenthood Federation told The Independent on Monday: "Donald Trump's return to power represents a direct assault on those seeking lifesaving sexual and reproductive health care."
