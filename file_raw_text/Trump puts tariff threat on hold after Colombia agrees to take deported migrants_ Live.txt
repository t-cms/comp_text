Washington will not impose sanctions and tariffs on Colombia after the South American nation agreed to accept deported migrants from the United States, the White House said in a statement late on Sunday.
"The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay," it said.
President  had earlier fired back at  with "emergency 25 percent tariffs" and a number of  "decisive retaliatory measures" after the country's president, Gustavo Petro, blocked two repatriation flights from landing. 
He had added that a travel ban and visa revocations will be imposed on Colombian government officials as well as "all allies and supporters".
This comes after Petro said in a series of posts on X that Colombia would not accept military deportation flights from the U.S. until the Trump  sets up a process to treat Colombian migrants with "dignity and respect."
"I do not authorize the entry of North American planes carrying Colombian migrants into our territory," Petro said on X. "The U.S. must establish a protocol of dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them."
Meanwhile, the fallout of Trump's actions against any diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts within the federal government continues.
The  is removing training courses that included videos of its Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the female World War II pilots who ferried warplanes for the military. This comes as agencies and departments scramble to comply with Trump's crackdown on DEI efforts.

K and 's relationship has been far from smooth sailing, with the two having a turbulent dynamic since the Labour leader entered Downing Street. But now for his second term - does it look like tensions might finally be thawing?
If are to be believed, the answer is yes. The president struck an astoundingly positive tone when speaking about Starmer in some comments made to the BBC on board Air Force One on Saturday - saying he has a "very good relationship" with his British counterpart, and adding the prime minister has done a "very good job thus far".
But that doesn't paint the whole picture. It comes amid the backdrop of an , who has publicly criticised the UK PM, and anger over Labour helping Kamala Harris in the US election.

More DEI fallout: Air Force scraps course that used videos of Tuskegee Airmen and female WWII pilots
Sunday 26 January 2025 16:48
,
AP
The Air Force has removed training courses with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs - the female World War II pilots who were vital in ferrying warplanes for the military - to comply with the Trump administration's crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The videos were shown to Air Force troops as part of DEI courses they took during basic military training.
In a statement, the Air Force confirmed the courses with those videos had been removed and said it "will fully execute and implement all directives outlined in the Executive Orders issued by the President, ensuring that they are carried out with utmost professionalism, efficiency and in alignment with national security objectives."
The problem may not be with the historical videos themselves, but that they were used in Air Force basic military training DEI coursework. However, the lack of clearer guidance has sent the Air Force and other agencies scrambling to take the broadest approach to what content is removed to make sure they are in compliance.
The Tuskegee Airmen, known as the "Red Tails" were the nation's first Black military pilots who served in a segregated WWII unit and their all-Black 332nd Fighter Group had one of the lowest loss records of all the bomber escorts in the war.
They flew P-47 Thunderbolt, P-51 Mustang and other fighter aircraft to escort American bombers on dangerous missions over Germany. Before the fighter escorts began accompanying the slow and heavy U.S. bombers, losses were catastrophic due to getting dive-bombed and strafed by German aircraft.
In a statement late Saturday, Tuskegee Airmen Inc. the nonprofit foundation created to preserve the legacy of those pilots, said it was "strongly opposed" to the removal of the videos to comply with Trump's order.
The stories of the Tuskegee Airmen and the WASPs "are an essential part of American history and carried significant weight in the World War II veteran community. We believe the content of these courses does not promote one category of service member or citizen over another. They are simply a part of American military history that all service members should be made aware of," the group said.
