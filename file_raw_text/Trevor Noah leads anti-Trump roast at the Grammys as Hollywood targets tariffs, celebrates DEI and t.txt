A-listers used their glittering night of nights to stand up for DEI policies, transgender rights and take a swipe at President Donald Trump's key policies. 
Throughout the hours-long broadcast of the 67th annual Grammy Awards, artists from Shakira to Lady Gaga, and host Trevor Noah, spoke up share their thoughts on the state of affairs in the United States.
'I don't know if you know this, but there's been a few changes in Washington,' Trevor, who emigrated from South Africa in 2011, said.
'I'm going to enjoy tonight because this may be my last time I get to host anything in this country.'
'We're going to be honoring the best in music as voted on by the 13,000 members of the Recording Academy... and 20 million illegal immigrants,' he said.
The comment was an eyebrow raising dig at President Trump's mass deportation policy, which came into effect almost simultaneously to his inauguration. 
Referencing Trump's increasing trade war and tariffs, Trevor urged Beyonce to reconsider her upcoming Cowboy Carter tour.
'We can't afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50,' he said.
President Trump has promised the American public 'it will all be worth the price that must be paid' to bring about a 'Golden Age.'
Alicia Keys, while accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact award, made reference to another of Trump's lightning rod policies - the purge of diversity, equity and inclusion departments.
'DEI is not a threat, it's a gift,' she said.
'And the more voices, the more powerful the sound. When destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix.
'This is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices we've seen on this stage: talented, hard working people from different backgrounds, with different points of view. And it changes the game.' 
Hours earlier, Best New Artist winner Chappell Roan sent a message to the trans community during a red carpet interview with GLAAD.
'It's brutal right now,' she said.
'Trans people have always existed and they will forever exist, and they will never, no matter what happens, take trans joy away.
'That has to be protected more than anything because I would not be here without trans girls.'
In a message directly to transgender Americans, Chappell added: 'Just know that pop music is thinking about you and cares about you, and I'm doing my best to really stand up for you in every way I can.'
Later in the evening, while accepting her first ever Grammy, Chappell also called out record labels for not paying up and coming artists a 'liveable wage' or providing healthcare.
Lady Gaga also used her platform to express support for her transgender fans.
'I just want to say tonight that trans people are not invisible,' the singer said. 'Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.'
President Trump ruled that there are 'only two genders' after returning to the White House last month.
Two trans models and activists, Alex Consani and Richie Shaza, appeared on stage with Charli XCX as she performed 365 and Guess off her album, Brat.
Shakira accepted an award for Best Latin Pop Album, and took the opportunity to dedicate it to 'all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country.'
She said: 'You are loved, you are worth it and I will always fight with you.
'I, too, have been an immigrant who came to this country with a dream. Latinos, we are an unstoppable force. I will not tire of fighting with them and for them.'
 The 2025 Grammys were hosted by Trevor Noah for the fifth consecutive year and held at LA's Crypto.com Arena.
The show raised funds to support fire relief efforts after the devastation caused by the LA blazes which began on January 7 in Pacific Palisades.
Superstar singer Beyonce dominated the list of Grammy Award contenders with 11 nods, taking home Album of the Year and Country Album of the Year for her venture into country music, Cowboy Carter.
Kendrick Lamar was another big winner of the night, taking both Song of the Year and Record of the Year, while Sabrina Carpenter walked away with two wins in Pop categories.
Winners were chosen by the roughly 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy.
