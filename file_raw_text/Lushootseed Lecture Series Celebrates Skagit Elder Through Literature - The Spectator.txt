Lushootseed Lecture Series Celebrates Skagit Elder Through Literature

Sasha Volovnikov Vi "taq?s?blu" Hilbert's daughter, Jill "tsi sq?ux??a?l" La Pointe, senior director of Seattle University's IPI, makes an opening speech introducing author Janet Yoder.

Last Wednesday writers, scholars, tribal members, indigenous people and students all gathered in the hub of the Byte Cafe to attend the Lushootseed lecture series hosted by the Indigenous Peoples Institute and the Lemieux Library. Local author Janet Yoder spoke and spotlighted her book "Where the Language Lives: Vi Hilbert and the Gift of the Lushootseed." In the book, Yoder reflects on her friendship and mentorship with Skagit elder Vi Hilbert and her work to preserve the native Lushootseed language. For Yoder, her relationship with Hilbert began when she first took Hilbert's class at the University of Washington in 1978. She was transformed by the vital importance of the Lushootseed language, native stories, and preserving history through culture in distinct communities within the Pacific Northwest. 
The Lushootseed language is credited as Seattle's original language from the Coast Salish People and is spoken in the Suquamish, Duwamish, Snoqualmie, Puyallup, Muckleshoot, Squaxin and Nisqually territories. Today, there is no remaining demographic of people who speak Lushootseed as their first language. 
Yoder described how she first began writing her book after a trip up the Skagit River with the late Skagit elder many years ago, and how she eventually finished the book during the COVID-19 pandemic. She detailed how Hilbert was very involved and influential in the writing process.
"Afterwards I asked her if I could come interview her, about what it was like to be back on Skagit with all these eagles. We just talked and talked, then I transcribed it all and we just talked and talked," Yoder said.
Yoder mentioned the importance of being intentional and authentic when it comes to storytelling. She also described how the pandemic gave her the push to complete the book.
"The pandemic hit and I thought if I don't survive this time because I am not a young person, what would I regret having not completed? It came to me that I needed to pull this all together," Yoder said. 
Hilbert was known for her lifelong work of transcribing and conserving Native American history within Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. She received many awards and accolades for her work in linguistics and her dedication to teaching in academia, including honorary doctorates from the University of Washington and Seattle University.  
During the lecture, she highlighted Hilbert's unique experiences and personal struggles, part of growing up in the early 20th century particularly living through the Second World War, surviving Native American Boarding Schools in her youth, and her fight to access education in the Public Schooling system. Yoder's storytelling highlighted Hilbert's relentless fight against adversity and her faith in herself to not fail. Enduring Native American oppression, Yoder gives a play-by-play on how Hilbert worked to take control of her future and write her own story. 
"So I wrote and when I felt like it was finished. I printed it off for her and we talked about it. She gave it her blessing and it was published," Yoder said.

Jill La Pointe, director of the Indigenous People's Institute at Seattle U and granddaughter of Hilbert, was in attendance and spoke about how the book commemorated her grandmother's work and commitment to her native community. 
"I can just close my eyes and vision being with my grandmother and being in these places. She writes so beautifully and gives such a wonderful introduction to who she was," La Pointe said. 
La Pointe also reiterated how the book acknowledged Hilbert's spirit and commitment to lifelong learning.
"That's why she did the work, she wanted people whenever they were interested to have the materials available to them to pick up."
Another person in attendance was First-year Business Management Major Ajay Custer. Custer was in awe of the diverse turnout of attendees and the community engagement that the event promoted. Custer was more impressed to learn about the lasting impact Hilbert has had on the Seattle U Community and beyond. 
"The power that one person can have on a large scale, doing something like spreading a language on its last legs and inspiring so many people is my biggest takeaway. Work hard and you can do a lot," Custer said. 
Custer talked about the significance of the university hosting events that pay homage to trailblazers like Hilbert and how they bring the community together. 
"I've always been interested in going to outside lectures for topics I find interesting, native languages are one of them. I find there's a lot of connections. I am a philosophy minor so I like hearing what people have to say." 
The next Lushootseed event, a part of the series, is underway and will take place March 19, featuring Native American storyteller and artist Robert Fernandez.
