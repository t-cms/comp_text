Arizona baseball earns fifth consecutive victory with late rally against Rice

February 28, 2025
Mason Kumet Mason White throws to first base to close the inning on a double play against DBU on June 1 during the Tucson Regional of the NCAA Baseball Tournament. White recorded one run for the Wildcats during the game.
The University of Arizona baseball team (5-3) marked a five-run rally in the seventh inning, propelling the Wildcats to their fifth consecutive victory, securing an 11-8 win over the Rice University Owls at Reckling Park in Houston, Texas on Wednesday night.
Trailing 7-5 entering the seventh, the Wildcats found a prime opportunity. With the bases loaded, Adonys Guzman, who had already belted a 2 run home run earlier, stepped up this time with a 3 run double into right-center that gave Arizona the lead. Right fielder Brendan Summerhill followed with a 2 run double of his own, capping off the decisive inning and pushing the Wildcats into double digits.
Arizona's offense was led by Guzman, who finished 2-for-3 with five RBIs, including his second home run of the season. Center fielder Aaron Walton also played a key role, going 3-for-4 with a double, an RBI, and reaching base five times. Summerhill contributed a 3-for-6 night with a triple and two RBIs, while designated hitter Garen Caulfield chipped in with a pair of hits and an RBI.
On the mound, Arizona's bullpen delivered in the late innings. Right-hander Garrett Hicks (2-0) secured the win with two scoreless innings, yielding just 1 hit while striking out 3. Right-hander Tony Pluta also impressed, striking 3 over 1.2 shutout innings.
Rice put up a strong fight, racking up 14 hits in the contest. Tobias Motley led the Owls with a career-high 4 hits, and Barrett Eldridge launched a 3 run homer in the fourth to erase an early Arizona lead. Treyton Rank's two-run single in the sixth gave Rice a 7-5 advantage, but Arizona's explosive seventh inning proved to be the difference.
Looking ahead
Arizona will now shift its focus to the Astros Foundation College Classic, where the Wildcats will face Texas A&M University, Mississippi State University and the University of Tennessee from Friday, Feb. 28 to Sunday, March 2 at Daikin Park in Houston, Texas.
