WILL CAIN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: It's 4:00 on the East Coast. This is "The Will Cain Show" live from the heartland.
And we start with this. Peace through strength, turns out it works. And we have got three very clear examples on that just one weekend to President Trump's second term.
Let's start with what happened just yesterday with the president of Colombia, a fascinating melodrama played out in a matter of hours, and largely, at least on the side of the United States of America, on a golf course.
Yesterday morning, the president of Colombia suggested that he would not, in fact, accept Colombian illegal immigrants being repatriated to Colombia. He put this out early Sunday morning.
His name is Gustavo Petro, and he put on to X: "The U.S. cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals. I deny the entry of American planes carrying Colombian migrants into our territory."
Now, I think it's worth pointing out that in the past that might have set off a couple of weeks, perhaps a month versus intra-agency memos in Washington, D.C., where several departments would have come together and eventually come to a conclusion and a solution with Colombia that largely was a hollow victory.
Let's know what happened yesterday, not on X, not in the new United States of America. Instead, President Trump, some suggesting from about the third hole of a golf course, posted onto TRUTH Social the actions that he would take, immediately 25 percent tear off on all goods coming into United States. And then, in one week, that would be raised to 50 percent.
How about a travel ban and immediate visa revocations on Colombian government officials and all their allies and supporters, visa sanctions and all party members, family members and supporters of the Colombian government? That sent shockwaves, clearly, not just to Colombia, but largely here in the United States as well on the left.
First, the president of Colombia went off on a rant that would really make someone like Noam Chomsky or Bernie Sanders proud. It was pure socialism, unadulterated insanity and Marxism.
He put out a statement that said: "You can try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance. I will die in my law. I resisted torture and I resist you. What I want next are to Colombia to be next to lovers of freedom. If you can't accompany me, well, then I will go elsewhere."
He talked about slavery and colonialism, a lot of bravado. There was more bravado, speaking of leftists and socialists, right here back home in America, as I mentioned, on the left.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she was very concerned, not so much about the level of illegal immigration in the United States. She's fine to step over illegal immigrants on the streets of New York City, as long as she's going to Starbucks to get a little cheaper coffee. See, that's what she's concerned about now.
She said: "To punish Colombia, Trump is about to make every American pay even more for coffee. Remember, we pay the tariffs, not Colombia. Trump is all about making inflation for Americans worse, not better."
In the same vein, Ana Navarro of "The View" was concerned about the price of flowers as we head into Valentine's Day. With their priorities firmly set, everyone seemed ready to rally against President Trump, the president of Colombia and the president of the socialists here in America, AOC.
And then some say, by about the eighth hole, and no reports on if President Trump had parred or birdied most of the holes ensuing, it all came to an end, surprisingly.
This statement was put out, a joint statement, Colombia and the United States: "We have overcome the impasse with the government of the United States. We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees."
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, put out a statement saying that all sanctions and tariffs would be put in reserve. We will wait and see how it goes with Colombia. And, again, this all went down while President Trump was playing 18 yesterday in Florida.
Peace through strength. It wasn't only on display yesterday, by the way, in Colombia. Do you know that there was a U.S. prisoner released from Belarus? This is according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. We didn't even know there was an American hostage in Belarus.
But Marco Rubio told us: "Thanks to POTUS' leadership, Belarus just unilateral released an American, innocent American, Anastassia Nuhfer, who was taken under Joe Biden. Our team did a great job on this. Peace through strength."
And then the announcement that more hostages would be released this week from Gaza, scheduled out through the week. More families of American Israelis can expect to be reunited with their long-held world family members in Gaza.
What we see here is simply leadership, the world responding to clarity, vision, directness, and leadership.
Our next guest is introducing legislation to impose new sanctions on Colombia after yesterday's back-and-forth, as Trump once again prevailed in his motive of peace through strength.
His name is Bernie Moreno. He's an Ohio Republican senator. He's a brand- new Senator, and he joins me now.
Senator, thanks for being with us.
It does seem like this came to a successful conclusion yesterday afternoon. You are proposing legislation that would put new sanctions on to Colombia. Is it necessary after the way it played out yesterday?
SEN. BERNIE MORENO (R-OH): Well, Will, thank you for having me on.
And just want to remind you and your viewers I was actually born in Colombia, South America, to Colombian parents. I became a naturalized citizen when I was 18. I love Colombia. I have relatives that live there. And, by the way, Colombians love America. They don't love their current president.
So what you saw yesterday, what wasn't reported was that the people of Colombia, political leaders, business leaders, rallied in support of President Trump, denouncing Petro's actions, which were totally outrageous. So we have those sanctions on the shelf should we need them.
This guy's only in office for a little bit over a year from now. Then Colombians can elect a new president that's going to be a good friend of the United States. We have had a great, positive relationship with America. And I think that will continue when we have a new president in Colombia that actually looks out for their country and not looks out for themselves.
CAIN: Well, speaking of clarity when it comes to leadership, Senator, Vice President J.D. Vance began his media tour speaking to the media. He did choose CBS and Margaret Brennan to talk with this weekend on Sunday.
They talked about the border. They talked about inflation. And they talked about states across this great United States of America and how they respond to disasters. And Brennan was pretty revealing about how she felt about some of the states in our country. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARGARET BRENNAN, HOST, "FACE THE NATION": FEMA has specialized expertise that some of these states just don't have...
SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Oh, Margaret, I...
BRENNAN: ... in their arsenal.
VANCE: I wish that they...
BRENNAN: And how will states who are -- who are lower-income states, the Mississippis, the Kentuckys, the Alabamas, be able to do this for themselves without federal help?
VANCE: Well, the president, to be clear, is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind.
He's saying that, in the way that we administer these resources, some of which is coming from the federal level, some of which is coming from the state level, we've got to get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most.
BRENNAN: But these are the first responders.
VANCE: Let's be honest, Margaret. You talk about the expertise from FEMA. FEMA in North Carolina, in California, in Florida with some of the hurricanes has often been a disaster.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: Yes, I don't know what type of leadership she's seen in, I guess, the more elite and financially well-off states she's suggesting, like California or New York.
Your state, by the way, Ohio, it's dealt with some of these disasters, as it did in East Palestine. And the governor of Mississippi put out the following statement. He said: "Hilarious elitism by Margaret Brennan, claiming that Mississippians know less about emergency management than D.C. bureaucrats, all because her favorite Democrats in California and North Carolina have failed their constituents."
Senator, we pride ourselves here on being in touch with the rest of America. What would you say to Margaret Brennan?
MORENO: Look, this is what the election was about. This is why they lost Michigan, why they have lost Ohio completely, why they lost Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, is because, at the end of the day, we're sick and tired of being looked down upon by these coastal elites that, by the way, why don't you focus on running your own cities properly, instead of telling us how to live?
I'm proud to live in Ohio. Ohio's got great people. We don't need Margaret or any other coastal elite telling us how to live our lives. And let me just say one more thing. J.D. Vance was the greatest vice presidential pick in American history.
It shows President Trump's decision-making. I'm so proud of what J.D. Vance has done. He is already just an outstanding vice president, and that interview really highlighted that.
CAIN: There's no doubt that's true. I think it's shared by many Americans.
It is notable, though, that you're not only an American. You are an Ohioan. So I understand a little bit of bias if there might be in that assessment of J.D. Vance. But it is shared, I think, by most Americans.
Thank you, Senator. Congratulations, and best of luck in your new job.
MORENO: Thank you. Let me just point out we are the national champions. Well, thank you.
(LAUGHTER)
CAIN: OK, you got that. You got that. That is true, Senator. Thank you so much.
All right, now to a FOX News Alert, suspected cartel gunmen in Mexico fire shots at Border Patrol agents in Fronton, Texas. This all happened about one hour ago. Law enforcement tells Bill Melugin it happened as cartel members tried to bring a group of illegal immigrants across the river. The agents fired back. No one on either side was hit. The group of illegal immigrants did not make it across the Red River.
Now, this coming as President Trump and his administration have already been successful in carrying out one of the biggest campaign promises, and that is mass deportations.
Alexis McAdams has the numbers on where we have started -- Alexis.
ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Will.
Yes, this has been going on since day one and all throughout the weekend. We're talking about hundreds of arrests and the raids are far from over. As ICE says, they're going after the worst migrants who are in the country illegally first, arresting migrants accused of drug trafficking, gun charges and child sex crimes.
So this weekend, ICE raids, we're talking from Chicago to Miami, arrests in Philly and, soon, I'm told crackdowns coming right here to New York City. The team out in Colorado also very busy over the weekend, federal agents from the DEA raiding this party in the Denver area. You can see them all standing outside there in the snow and the cold.
That's because the authorities went in there for an ongoing investigation. And that Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua we talked about for a long time, well, the team says 50 migrants were taken into custody. And the DEA Rocky Mountain team says they busted this Tren de Aragua party so fast some of the cerveza was still left on ice before the party was over.
But some, including Selena Gomez, are not happy about this immigration crackdown, the celebrity sobbing in a video she posted on her Instagram story. She had a Mexican flag emoji, saying this. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SELENA GOMEZ, ACTRESS: How many people are getting attacked? The children, they don't understand. I'm so sorry. I wish I could do something, but I can't. I don't know what to do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCADAMS: Doesn't know what to do, but Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, is firing back at this video, Will.
He says the targets of these raids are not abuelas. They're criminals.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM HOMAN, WHITE HOUSE BORDER CZAR: I don't think we arrested any families. We have arrested public safety threats and national security threats, bottom line.
And, look, President Trump won the election this one issue, securing our border and saving lives. This -- what happened on our southern border the four is the biggest national security threat this country has seen at least in my lifetime, because we got over two million known got-aways. We have got a 600 percent increase in sex trafficking. We got a record number of terrorists crossing the border on the terrorist watch list.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCADAMS: Sources telling FOX News that New York City is next. They're waiting to see what raids are going to happen here.
And Homan says, all the crying aside, this is a national security threat that Trump said he was going to fix from the beginning, Will.
CAIN: OK, well, thank you, Alexis. hand thank you for sharing that very sane video from Selena Gomez...
MCADAMS: Yes. You're welcome.
CAIN: ... over what's going on across the United States. We will see you later, Alexis.
And it might be worth pointing out that if you are looking into a camera, I think this is a fair opinion to hold, if you are looking into a camera, emoting, crying, sharing your feelings with millions of strangers, you are not on sane ground.
You're not emotionally healthy, that or you're an actress and you're performing, in which case, why are you not performing for the, what is it, 100,000 people that have died from fentanyl overdose because of the crimes being committed by crossing over our border illegally, or the 300,000 children who have gone missing coming over our border illegally and disappearing to the hands of cartels and criminals across the United States?
Selective performance or pure insanity from Selena Gomez.
House Republicans are in Trump's home state of Florida to hammer out his agenda. They're set to meet with him soon. But, before they do, one of them joins me.
And here's a quick look at the corner of Wall and Broad, where it was a rough day for your money, especially in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. That's because there was a major sell-off due to the Chinese company DeepSeek upsetting the entire race in A.I.
We're going to get into that in a little bit here coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I think we are entering a new era of government.
And that is, when the president says he wants to make the government more efficient and effective and we say we want to limit the size and scope of government, it means that everything is on the table for reevaluation. This is a new moment.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: All right, so House Republicans hammering out President Trump's agenda at their annual issues conference in Florida today. That's ahead of a big meeting tonight with Donald Trump.
My next guest joins us ahead of that meeting. He's Georgia Republican Congressman Buddy Carter.
Congressman, thanks for being with us today here on the show.
The big question going in, I think, to this meeting is, how unified can you guys become? You have control of the House. You have control of the Senate. You have control of the presidency. And there's a ton of momentum, executive orders and now department heads put into place with Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio and more to come.
The question is, can Republicans come together when this moves to the legislative side of the agenda?
REP. BUDDY CARTER (R-GA): Well, that's the question. And the answer is a definite, yes, we can, and we will.
Look, there was a mandate last November by the American people; 77 million people said they wanted Donald Trump to be president again and they wanted him to shake things up. They wanted him to secure that border. They wanted him to lower the cost of living. They wanted him to make sure that we were respected on the world stage.
We understand that. Donald Trump got more votes than Republican members of Congress got. We only got 73.4 million. He got 77 million.
CAIN: Right.
CARTER: So the mandate is there. The message is there from the American people.
And, yes, the Republican Congress will be -- legislatively will be unified.
CAIN: I almost hear you, Congressman -- it almost feels like I hear you talking to your fellow Republicans. And, again, that's all you have to talk to, right? You don't have to worry really about the Democrats.
But there's all these fracture lines, understandably. Everybody's elected to represent their district and their point of view. You will have Thomas Massie on one side with a more libertarian point of view. You will have other Republican congressmen with a neocon point of view. You will have fiscal hawks. You will have Northeast moderate Republicans.
And the question is, can all of that be wrangled? I mean, your majority right now is one, right, until March. And then it goes to three. Good luck, Speaker Johnson. But you have to be together to keep this momentum going for Trump.
CARTER: Well, that's that slim majority certainly won't take any getting used to. We have been having a slim majority in the House.
And I will tell you, you're absolutely on point. And it's a point well made. And that is we are a very diverse group. We have got a lot of different people with a lot of different views. But at the same time, we understand when we get a mandate. We understand when the American people speak and when they speak loudly and they say, we want this done.
We want spending cut. We want to stop this outrageous debt that we have now, $36 trillion, the interest on our debt, more than what we're spending on defense. We can't continue that, and we understand that. And that's what the American people want to see action on.
CAIN: Well, we're going to keep an eye on this, because this is scheduled to take place here in just any minute. You have got the conference ongoing, the retreat's ongoing. We expect to hear from President Trump joining you guys.
One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you, Congressman, is the way you have been talking about taxes. And I don't think it's -- I do not think it should be dismissed. OK? You have introduced a bill essentially to do away with the IRS and do away with the income tax. You want to bring in the FairTax, which is a consumption tax.
Now, here's why I say this kind of thing comes up, but I don't think it should be dismissed, because President Trump is saying things as well like, hey, maybe we should send 90,000 new IRS agents, not to collect taxes, but to go to the border. And he's saying things like, maybe we should consider that tariffs could take the place of an income tax.
Do you think any of this, your idea, his idea is a realistic form of tax reform?
CARTER: Absolutely, I do, Will.
And I will tell you, I can one-up the president here. Instead of sending just 90,000 IRS agents down there, we can send them all down there. We can do away with the IRS. And that's what the FairTax will do. The FairTax is a consumption tax.
Right now, unelected armed bureaucrats have more control over your paycheck than you do. That's why we need to change this. We need to give the people the power, the people the power over their own taxes. They can decide what they're going to pay. And with the consumption tax, you can do that.
And we will catch the underground market. If you're here illegally, you're still going to pay your taxes because you're going to pay a consumption tax. It's a fair tax. It's a simple tax. It makes all the sense in the world, no tax on tips, no tax on anything.
CAIN: Right. Well, we certainly need tax reform. We need to simplify the tax code. We need to replace it with a FairTax. We need something. It doesn't need to be so complicated. We need to find something. And dismiss President Trump and his wild ideas at your own peril. Talking to anyone who thinks this is an out-of-place conversation.
Maybe it will be the FairTax.
Congressman Buddy Carter, thanks for being with us here on the show.
CARTER: Thank you.
CAIN: All right.
I want to point something out really quickly, if I might. I said Red River earlier when I was talking about the border. Thank you for putting me back on camera. Of course, as a good Texan, I know the illegal immigrants across the Rio Grande, but I'm such a North Texan that sometimes you don't know what happens between your brain and your mouth. And I said Red River.
So that will make for a nice lowlight come Friday here on "The Will Cain Show."
All right, now to big news in the world of A.I., as China seems to be closing the gap. Look what happens when you ask China A.I. firm DeepSeek a question about the CCP. It doesn't answer.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAIN: This story is a really big deal and we intend to dig into it much deeper in the days of head, but it's a game changer in the world of artificial intelligence.
So a Chinese company called DeepSeek has totally disrupted what we thought would be the future of A.I.
Now, Madison Alworth of FOX Business is here to explain -- Madison.
MADISON ALWORTH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: All right.
So, here's the thing. When it comes to DeepSeek, it's a game changer because it's amazing that it was created. It's the brainchild of a small group of researchers working for a Chinese hedge fund manager that have been able to produce technology that's on par with OpenAI. Think ChatGPT and Google.
But they have done this with less money, less time and fewer chips. DeepSeek said that training one of its latest models cost $5.6 million. Compare that to the $100 million that Anthropic cited last year. Then, when it comes to the chips, DeepSeek claims to have used just around 2,000 Nvidia chips to train its V3 model.
That's compared to the tens of thousands of chips used for U.S. models. This has caused a big sell-off Nvidia, down almost 17 percent today, the chipmaker ending down because they are the baseboard of U.S. artificial intelligence.
It was really taking it on the chin across the board. DeepSeek, it seemingly shows that you can get similar results with far less energy, far less money and fewer chips.
CAIN: OK, Madison, let me see if I understand together here. So all of this money right now for the future of A.I. is largely focused on the energy needed to run the A.I. companies like ChatGPT or what Grok or whatever it may be, but also the infrastructure underneath the energy, meaning the data houses, the warehouses that are filled up with these chips, right?
Like Elon Musk's Grok, it's in Memphis and it's huge warehouses with chips because the presumption was Nvidia or any of these others had to have tons of chips to do A.I.
ALWORTH: Yes.
CAIN: And out of the blue, here's the Chinese company that does it for -- what you have up the figure a minute ago, like a fifth of the price, $5 million versus $100 million?
ALWORTH: Yes.
CAIN: And like you said like a 10th of the number of chips?
ALWORTH: Exactly. So they have totally disrupted.
I mean, so this was released late last week. The markets just started reacting today. But essentially they say their latest model was trained on 2,000 chips, compared to tens of thousands of chips, chips being Nvidia. That's why I highlighted that company.
CAIN: Right.
ALWORTH: The concern there is that we needed a lot of power and money for these A.I. companies, which are the future of really everything. But China and this company are claiming that you can do it with a lot less.
Now, we always have to keep in mind, when you're dealing with China, CCP or any Chinese company, you're not sure if they're underreporting or if they're telling the truth.
CAIN: Right.
ALWORTH: And this is something I have, we have heard and seen Elon Musk came out today also raising skepticism, claiming that they might be using more power and more chips than they actually report.
And then on top of all of this, I do think the tech community is a little concerned about the safety. I want to pull up real quick. Something that we were able to do today was ask DeepSeek some questions. And because it's based in China, there's an undeniable connection to the CCP.
So you ask it things about Tiananmen Square, or if Taiwan is an independent country, and they either refuse to respond, or, with Taiwan, they said that they don't acknowledge Taiwan as an independent country.
CAIN: Right.
ALWORTH: So there are concerns around where this is based and what it would mean for U.S. companies to use it. So you still might see these tech entrepreneurs here in the U.S. relying on OpenAI, Anthropic for their A.I. technology.
CAIN: Right.
ALWORTH: But if you can do it cheaper, if you can do it with less chips and it's open-source, so it's very cost effective, you're going to see tech in the U.S. turn to things like DeepSeek.
CAIN: Right.
And then, therefore, all those companies that have invested in A.I. hundreds of billions of dollars all of a sudden flushed that money down the toilet. It just seems, if all this is true, they could immediately win in A.I.
We will have to follow this, Madison. We're fascinated by this. I want to dig into it deeper as the week goes along. But thank you for setting this straight so far. Thank you so much.
All right, President Trump is following through on his promise to reinstate service members who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine. He's offered them full back pay. My next guest was forced out of the military while she was pregnant. And she joins us next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAIN: Any minute now, President Trump is expected to follow through with more promises to reshape and rebuild the American military, along with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed on Friday night in a nail- biter.
But, as J.D. Vance pointed out, a win is a win, no matter the score. So what's anticipated is that, at some point today, he will sign executive orders relating to keeping transgender people out of the military and taking DEI training out of the military.
Earlier today, President Trump said he will reinstate thousands of service members who were discharged from the military for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
My next guest was pregnant with her second child when she was forced out of the military over the vaccine. That's former Army physician Lieutenant Colonel Danielle Smith. And she joins me now.
Lieutenant Colonel, thanks for being with us. Congratulations. You're one of 8,000 reinstated with back pay. How do you feel today?
LT. COL. DANIELLE SMITH, FORMER U.S. ARMY PHYSICIAN: No, thank you for having me, Will.
And I think President Trump is definitely doing the right thing. And this should have been done a long time ago when the mandate was rescinded. But I think what President Trump and Pete Hegseth need to realize is that this is not that simple.
The situation with the vaccine mandate lasted for almost a year for me. And during that time, I was ostracized by my own command. I was shunned. There was character defamation. I walked around with what felt like a target on my back.
And in the end, it ended up working out relatively OK. I did receive an honorable discharge. But for a year, we didn't know what was going to happen. And there was a lot of threats of being put in prison for disobeying the order. And at the time, I had a young 3-month-old exclusively breast-fed.
And all I could do was stick by God and stand our ground and kind of see what happens. But the culture and the morale of the military was declining and has declined. And that's really the deep seat of the issue.
CAIN: I just want to point out, in case anyone missed in your introduction, you're a physician. So you made these choices informed.
SMITH: Yes.
CAIN: And -- but I hear you say Pete Hegseth and President Trump should understand it's not that simple. What do you mean by it's not that simple? I assume you're happy with what they have done starting today with the reinstatement of all the military members who refused the vaccine. But what are you warning them against?
SMITH: Well, so the issue is, is that the chain of command during this time, they had the opportunity to go to bat for their service men and service women or to approach the whole situation with professionalism and respect. And, in fact, they did just the opposite.
They lied to their soldiers. First, they slandered them behind their back, ed, in public. And when it came down to it, they -- it was just a facade. The whole exemption process was just for show to the American people to make it look like they were following their own policies.
But, I mean, I received an e-mail telling me that the three-star general of the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg would not approve any medical exemption request and that I could still submit it if I wanted to. So it was all a lie to the service men and the service women and the American people.
CAIN: So I guess what I'm hearing you say is the job before Secretary Hegseth and the job before President Trump has just begun in reinstating you guys...
SMITH: Yes.
CAIN: ... that the culture is so ingrained up the chain of command that they have a big job ahead of them to set it back on the right path. Is that fair, what you're saying?
SMITH: Yes, all those commanders are still in command, are still part of...
CAIN: Right.
SMITH: A lot of them are still part of the military chain of command structure. And, quite honestly, it's going to be hard to sluice all that out, because I mean, it ran rampant from the highest of the command down to the company commanders.
CAIN: Right.
SMITH: And while we're meant to follow orders, it's not without using your logic and your reason. I mean, that's how you become Nazi Germany...
CAIN: I got to leave it there.
SMITH: ... if you don't think about what you're being ordered to do.
CAIN: Well, I happen to know Secretary Hegseth fairly well and I happen to know that -- his philosophy on this. And that is if you cut out some of these high-ranking officials who put these policies in place, you will disincentivize those down the command of chain ranks to start following, true good incentives, like lethality and the purpose of the American military.
Can I just say we're happy for you today, Lieutenant Colonel? And thank you for being with us here today.
SMITH: Thank you. And regardless of people reinstating or choosing not to, they should all be respected for their integrity and their courage -- and courage for displaying the very traits that recruiters look for in a soldier.
CAIN: Right.
SMITH: So God bless all of them.
CAIN: All right, thank you for your service.
SMITH: Thank you.
CAIN: Meanwhile, President Trump, as we mentioned, bringing common sense back to America.
That'S this military issue. Banning transgender women as well from the military is part of this move towards common sense, transgender persons, both ways. Can I just share with you something fascinating? He also just put executive order out to ban transgender prison transfer across. So, in other words, you have got to go to prison with the gender you were born.
And listen to this stat, and this was put out today by The New York Times; 15 percent of female prisoners are transgender, meaning males; 15 percent of women in prison are actually men.
My next guest is all too aware of transgender activism. She was doing an event at the University of Washington when this happened.
Riley Gaines Center ambassador Olivia Krolczyk joins me now.
Olivia, that's pretty incredible video. Unfortunately, we have seen that from time to time. We have seen it from Riley. Now we hear, see it with you as well. What did that feel like?
OLIVIA KROLCZYK, AMBASSADOR, RILEY GAINES CENTER: Of course, it was terrifying to know that I was locked in the event space along with the security officers, essentially held hostage by these violent protesters, about 200 of them, including Antifa.
That video doesn't even begin to explain what happened. We had windows broken, noisemakers thrown in, fire alarms pulled multiple times. It was horrifying. The police officers actually had to resort to dressing me in police gear to escort me safely out of the building. That's how dangerous the situation was, all because I was going on campus to let them know that we deserve free speech, that DEI should not be in our schools, and that men actually do not deserve to play in women's sports.
CAIN: Incredible.
Look at this rebuttal that's on your screen right now and exactly how you just described the situation unfolding. What does it mean to you to hear, though, some of these commonsense reformations coming from the White House when it comes to military service, prison, and every other aspect of our society, including sports?
KROLCZYK: I think it's incredibly important, what Donald Trump is doing. Of course, it doesn't matter if he's writing it into law if we're not actually going to enforce these laws.
That's something at the Riley Gaines Center, we ambassadors are going to continue to go to campuses to try and give our speeches about our stories, to make sure that these campuses are actually inviting and promoting free speech, because Donald Trump said that, if these campuses do not promote free speech, they will lose all their federal funding.
And that's very important, because our nation is founded upon free speech. And if we can't even have a respectful conversation and debate on our college campuses, it really undermines our education system as a whole.
CAIN: Pretty simple. Pretty true.
Olivia, thank you so much for being with us.
I don't know if you can hear the theme here between both my last guests, but this is a start is what they both have suggested. But this is so ingrained in every institution, from higher education to the military, that it's going to take vigilance to ensure it doesn't stay there in the mid- levels of management.
All right, the Kansas City Chiefs looking to make it three in a row. They're set to take on the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAIN: After years of disputes and debates about the origin of COVID, the CIA now considers the lab leak theory the most likely cause of the pandemic, of course.
Now Alexandria Hoff has the story.
Hey, Alexandria.
ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Will. Good to be with you.
Yes, this new stance isn't the product of a new administration. The assessment was ordered and completed under President Biden. The difference here is that newly confirmed CIA Director John Ratcliffe made it a point and made the decision to release the findings. Here is what he had to say.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN RATCLIFFE, CIA DIRECTOR: I think it was important for the American people to see an institution like the CIA get off the sidelines and be truthful about what our intelligence shows.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HOFF: So, according to the agency, the CIA -- quote -- "assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a neutral origin, based on the available body of reporting." That's from the CIA there.
So, for years, the agency said it didn't have enough evidence to make a determination where the pandemic was rooted. During that time, those who floated the Wuhan lab leak theory were cast off by the mainstream as conspiracy theorists.
Senator Tom Cotton earned early pushback for that. He reacted to the CIA's update on "FOX News Sunday."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): I didn't have access to classified intelligence or special scientific knowledge. I just used a little common sense and looked at the facts and understood what Chinese communists do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HOFF: Dr. Anthony Fauci denied accusations that he worked to sway Americans into believing, as he did, that the virus came from an animal, assuring in testimony last year that the Wuhan lab theory itself wasn't a conspiracy, but:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: What is conspiracy is the kind of distortions of that particular subject, like it was a lab leak and I was parachuted into the CIA like Jason Bourne and told the CIA that they should really not be talking about a lab leak.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. Appreciate it.
FAUCI: That's the conspiracy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HOFF: He wrapped it up there saying "That's the conspiracy."
So the CIA now joins the FBI and Energy Department in favoring the lab leak theory. China unsurprisingly rejects the claim, Will.
CAIN: I would suggest that Dr. Anthony Fauci does not take the stand to give any more testimony or he will be pushing the limits of that pardon extended to him by Joe Biden. Thank you, Alexandria.
HOFF: Sure.
CAIN: OK, I hate to say I told you so. No, not really.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: You want me to just lay it out? Eagles, Chiefs, that's my prediction.
CRAIG CARTON, HOST, "BREAKFAST BALL": Oh.
CAIN: No?
CARTON: I have known you a long time and you never cease to disappoint me with your picks when it comes to football games.
You are the definition of chalk, chalk, chalk, chalk, chalk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: No, no, no, not chalk, chalk, chalk. Right, right, right, Carton.
And then we have a relationship that seems to be repeating this cycle. You make fun of my picks, my picks up -- end up being right. So I predicted Super Bowl LIX. It's the Kansas City Chiefs trying for the first ever three-peat going up against the Philadelphia Eagles. You can watch the big game on FOX in two weeks.
Let's bring in Chris "The Bear" Fallica, host of "Bear Bets" at FOX Sports, gambling show.
And my friend, colleague of many different places where we have worked together, now here with me on "The Will Cain Show."
Hey, Chris, so if Kansas City does three-peat, greatest team ever, biggest dynasty, surpassing the Cowboys, the Patriots, the Niners?
CHRIS FALLICA, HOST, "BEAR BETS": It's hard to argue against that. You certainly would not be laughed off the stage for suggesting that, what, seven straight conference championship games, three straight Super Bowls with arguably a quarterback you can put up there as the greatest all time, Andy Reid finally getting his due.
And the way they have done it with all of the losses they suffered at receiver and the skill positions, they just kind of done it with different players every year. And the one common denominator has just been Mahomes and the stability on the coaching staff. So you certainly could make a pretty good case that it's the most dominant run in NFL history. That's for sure.
CAIN: Well, I want to ask you. OK, I don't take anything away from the Chiefs. I predicted that they would win, but the game again had controversy. It just did, OK? And it happened. It was about in the fourth quarter, Bear, right?
It was a spot for a fourth-down play for the Buffalo Bills. It looked to the naked eye like Josh Allen got the first down. The ref spotted it behind the line, right? And it was a big turning point in the game. Whether or not that was right or wrong, I think this is a very legitimate point, Bear.
And it's made by Mike Gunzelman. And he said: "It's wild to me that tennis has the kind of technology to rule the ball in or out, but the NFL every single week continues to allow refs to ruin calls and sometimes even games. You mean to tell me that the NFL can't figure out a way to do this or putting a chip in the ball?"
I mean, those tennis shots, Bear, to his point, are flying, right? And the line of scrimmage on just spotting a ball is constant. It's fixed. I mean, it moves down the field, but it's fixed. If you had a chip in the ball and you could do this, there'd be no reason for controversy.
FALLICA: Well, it's interesting because Sam Schwartzstein, who used to play -- who was actually Andrew -- on Andrew Luck's offensive line at Stanford and a former colleague of mine when I was working at another place, he laid out a really good thread on Twitter about why this isn't as easy and as possible as people think.
He actually is involved in like the Competition Committee and the Rules Committee. I think it was with the XFL and kind of creating different ways to kind of go about rules and do the game. And he kind of lays it out as to the ball isn't a perfect circle. That's something that baseball and tennis have going for it, that when you move a football around, it's not always as easy to figure out a line.
So while, in theory, it sounds great, Sam kind of makes an argument as to it's not as easy as you think. Yes, well, my biggest issue was with that was I didn't hear a call on the field made right away. Like, they went to break and I was like, well, did they rule? Whatever they ruled on the field was how it was going to be -- like, they weren't going to be able to overturn that on replay.
And that was my biggest concern was like, OK, did they rule it a first down? Did they rule him short? And then they came back and finally you saw ruling on the field, a graphic short of first down. But, yes, it certainly reminded me a lot of that Ohio State-Michigan game. I guess it was in 2016 with the J.T. Barret, and the way he was kind of backing up into the first down line and the ball would was kind of behind him, and you really didn't get a good look.
CAIN: Right.
FALLICA: Whatever they ruled on the field was ultimately how it was going to be ruled. And bad luck for Buffalo.
CAIN: OK.
FALLICA: They did have chances after that to win the game and couldn't get it done, unfortunately for them.
CAIN: Let me say this to Philadelphia. I didn't ignore you. I know I focused on Kansas City, but I didn't ignore you.
By the way, goodbye to Bear. Thank you, Bear. We lost him there. I was going to say goodbye to Bear.
But, everybody in Philadelphia know, I'm not ignoring you. It's not because I'm a Cowboys fan. I think Kansas City was the talker today. I think Saquon Barkley is awesome. And we're going to talk about whether or not you have a shot in the Super Bowl.
But now let's go to what you, the viewers, think. It's time for "Will of the People."
One person commenting: "Congrats. Well-deserved. I love your show. I was hopeful before that you and Pete would get a two-hour slot named 'Off the Wall.'" It might have been possible. Now it's SecDef.
Another user saying: "Just keep doing what you're doing, Will. Just be sure and not call Jesse Watters Jessica anymore."
Going to work on that. Instead, I called the Rio Grande the Red River today.
And, finally: "I like how your show -- I'm getting used to the mic. Great job."
I knew you would, Mike. I knew you would get used to it.
We love reading your thoughts. If you're feeling ambitious, record your voice or take a video and send it in. And maybe we will play you right here on "The Will Cain Show," all right?
I will see you next time. It's time for "The Five."
