The clip features a portion of President Ronald Reagan's radio address to the nation on November 26, 1988.
Yet today, protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism, a fig leaf for those unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the resolve to stand up to real enemies - countries that would use violence against us or our allies. Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogs who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends - weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world -- all while cynically waving the American flag. The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom.

Since taking office on 20 January, Donald Trump has issued a series of executive orders aimed at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government and the private sector.
While Trump's orders have been celebrated by some supporters and allies, they have been criticized by advocacy groups who say they might deepen inequities and undo decades of progress made to enshrine civil rights protections for marginalized groups.

The Pentagon is readying orders for the deployment of at least 1,000 additional active duty troops to bolster President Donald Trump's expanding crackdown on immigration, U.S. officials said Friday.
They said roughly 500 more soldiers - largely a headquarters unit from the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum in New York - will be sent to the southwest border. And about 500 Marines will go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where some of the detained migrants will be held.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because announcements have not been made, said there have been ongoing discussions about the deployments and the numbers could increase if additional details are worked out.

Judge blocks Trump from freezing federal funding

Reuters
A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from freezing federal grants, loans, and other financial assistance at the urging of Democratic state attorneys general who said it would jeopardize critical government-funded services.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, came at the behest of Democratic attorneys generals from 22 states and the District of Columbia and despite the White House saying it was rescinding Monday's memo from its budget office detailing the policy.
McConnell said evidence showed the policy remained in effect despite the rescission of the Office of Management and Budget's "wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and ambiguous" directive, which he said was in "name-only" and possibly done to frustrate a legal challenge.
New York Attorney General Letitia James, who helped lead the litigation, hailed the decision, saying it would "block the White House's chaotic pause on federal funding."
McConnell issued a temporary restraining order preventing the administration from pausing assistance to the states and barred the Trump administration for reissuing the OMB directive under any other name.
The order, which is in effect pending a further ruling from McConnell, comes after a judge in Washington, D.C., issued a shorter administrative stay pausing the policy in response to a separate legal challenge by several nonprofit groups. A hearing in the Washington case is scheduled for Monday.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Wall St ends lower as White House says Trump to implement tariffs

Reuters
U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, with indexes losing ground after the White House said U.S. President Donald Trump will implement on Saturday tariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% on Chinese goods.
Investors have been bracing for further tariff news after Trump has repeatedly warned about using the measure. Uncertainty over the impact of tariffs has muddled the outlook for the economy and inflation.
"I would have thought the market would be down more," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. "It's not just the announcement itself, which I think probably impacts a select number of industries. It's whatever retaliation moves are taken."
Stocks turned lower on Friday afternoon after the White House said the tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China would take effect on Saturday.
After the closing bell, Trump said he expects his administration to impose tariffs related to oil and gas around Feb. 18. But he did not name a specific country to which the tariffs would apply or specify any more details about the plans.
