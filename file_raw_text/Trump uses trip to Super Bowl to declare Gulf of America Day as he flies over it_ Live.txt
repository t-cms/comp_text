President blasts judge who restricts Musk's DOGE from Treasury Department

Trump said he "100%" disagrees with the judge who has temporarily restricted Musk and his DOGE team from accessing the Treasury Department payment system. 
"I disagree with her 100%. I think it's crazy," Trump told Fox News host Bret Baier.
Musk, a billionaire who was recently named a "special government employee," has not gone through the traditional process to obtain the authority he has been bestowed. 
Musk does not have to disclose his finances nor face congressional approval. But he has vast access and power - something Democrats, state attorney generals and lawmakers have criticized.
Baier: "A judge agreed...to restrict Elon Musk and DOGE, from accessing Treasury Department payment and data systems. They said there was a risk of irreparable harm. What do you make of that?"  

Trump: "I disagree with it 100%. I think it's crazy."

Kristi Noem warns the public that they can't trust the government - then is reminded that she is part of it

Donald Trump's new secretary of Homeland Security forgot which side she was on.
Kristi Noem was grilled Sunday on CNN's State of the Union about Elon Musk's role in the federal government and his access to sensitive systems at DHS housing data collected by FEMA as part of its efforts to help disaster victims. Host Dana Bash pressed the secretary about whether Americans could be comfortable with Musk, whose DOGE group was not authorized by Congress and exists as a White House initiative, potentially accessing private data Americans authorized the federal government to collect.
Noem argued that they could, because Musk had been vetted by Trump himself: "The president has authorized him to have access to that."
She went on to be questioned by Bash about whether this represented an about-face by MAGA-world, which had erupted with rage against Hillary Clinton in 2016 for housing State Department emails on a private server at her home during Clinton's time as secretary of State.
"I remember a time when Republicans were very careful about and worried about the government, particularly unelected people, having access to personal data," noted Bash.

Trump's team worried Iranian spy would shoot down his plane with a missile: book
Sunday 9 February 2025 19:15
,
Ariana Baio
Donald Trump's campaign team worried that Iran could try to shoot down his plane after threats of an alleged plot to kill him became known.
The concern grew enough that the president flew in a plane separate from his recognizable "Trump Force One" to an event, according to an upcoming book about Trump's rise to power.
While campaigning for president last year, U.S. law enforcement officials warned Trump and his team that Tehran had placed operatives in the U.S. with access to surface-to-air missiles and there was an alleged plot to assassinate him.
After the Secret Service intervened in an almost-assassination attempt at his golf club in Florida, Trump's security detail heightened security concerns and chose to fly the future president on a decoy plane, owned by Steve Witkoff, and allowed Trump staff to fly on Trump Force One - much to their anger.
Staff worried they would be "collateral damage" if the jet were shot down by Iranian operatives, though campaign leaders assured them they were not "bait."
The new details are part of an upcoming book, Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump's Return to Power, by journalist Alex Isenstadt.

Speaker Johnson admits budget bill talks have stalled

John Bowden
Speaker Mike Johnson admitted on Sunday that he remains in a very tight spot with his caucus as he, with the president's backing, seeks to carve out a budget proposal that addresses longstanding demands from conservatives for significant cuts to federal spending.
Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Johnson said that the legislation is still set to be rolled out as one massive bill, per President Trump's stated wishes. But he cautioned that efforts to write a bill that could win the support of every Republican in his caucus was still ongoing. 
With a single-digit margin in the lower chamber, Republicans will either have to find unity in a caucus that has repeatedly relied on Democratic votes to pass major funding resolutions or take that same politically divisive option again.
"We might push it a little bit further because the details really matter. Remember that I have the smallest margin in history, about a two-vote margin currently, so I've got to make sure everyone agrees before we bring the project forward, that final product," said Johnson. 
"And we've got a few more boxes to check, but we're getting very, very close."

Republicans look to add taxes on college scholarships to help pay for Trump's tax cuts

Collin Binkley
Republican lawmakers are exploring controversial proposals targeting higher education to offset the cost of extending Trump-era tax cuts.
These include potentially taxing college scholarships, eliminating student loan repayment plans, and significantly increasing taxes on university endowments.
The proposals, currently circulating within House committees, are part of a broader effort to identify spending cuts and revenue streams. 
While still in the early stages, and with no guarantee of implementation, the mere consideration of such measures has sparked widespread concern among higher education advocates. 
They argue that these changes could dramatically reshape the landscape of college affordability and accessibility.

Russell Vought, the head of the Office of Management and Budget and now acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has effectively stopped the watchdog consumer group from protecting people from predatory practices.

Vought confirmed he made the decision in a post on X, saying he notified the Federal Reserve that the CFPB would not take its next draw of unappropriated funds. 
The CFPB was created after the 2008 financial crisis to oversee abusive, deceptive or unfair practices by big banks, payday lenders or other financial institutions.
It has long been a target of Republicans who see the CFPB as overly regulatory.
