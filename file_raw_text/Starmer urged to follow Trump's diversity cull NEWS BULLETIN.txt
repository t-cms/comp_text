The Conservatives have urged Sir Keir Starmer to follow Donald Trump and "unshackle" Britain from equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) schemes.
The new US President has ordered all federal diversity equality and inclusion (DEI) staff to be put on paid leave "immediately" and eventually laid off. The previous Tory government launched a crackdown on diversity, but this was placed under review by Labour within weeks of the party taking power.
