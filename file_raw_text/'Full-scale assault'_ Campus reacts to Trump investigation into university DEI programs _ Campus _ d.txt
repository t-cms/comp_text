Last week, the Trump administration made efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies through several executive orders and a freeze on federal grants and loans that has been temporarily blocked by a judge.
In an executive order issued Jan. 20, the administration ordered the termination of all DEI programs and positions in the public and private sectors within 60 days. Donald Trump also instructed federal institutions to investigate universities with DEI programs whose endowments exceed $1 billion. This includes UC Berkeley, which has a $6.95-billion endowment as of 2023.
"This is not just an attack on DEI but also really ... a full scale assault on civil rights in general," said Arneta Rogers, Berkeley Law's executive director of the Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice. "This administration is truly leading with these executive orders in such rapid succession. Having them at the top of the agenda is a really blatant, strong signal."
Rogers speculated that these policies are intended to intimidate universities with high endowments, but Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination, is still "the law of the land." Rogers said they believe this will protect university DEI programs.
Campus currently has a wide variety of DEI programs under the Division of Equity & Inclusion for undergraduate students, graduate students and staff, notably the Othering & Belonging Institute, the Office for Graduate Diversity and the Disabled Students' Program.
"The University of California is evaluating recent executive orders issued by President Trump and the subsequent agency guidance to understand their potential impact on our communities," said a spokesperson for the University of California Office of the President in an email statement.
Trump's pause on federal funding Tuesday, now temporarily blocked by a judge, also cites his DEI agenda. A memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget instructed federal agencies to pause the disbursement of federal financial assistance for DEI and "woke gender ideology," among other categories.
Organizations in the private sector including Target and Walmart have complied with Trump's executive order, voluntarily dropping DEI initiatives and ending data-sharing with entities that track equity, according to Rogers.
The Stanford University president told The Stanford Daily that the university expected to have to "review programs on campus that fall under the DEI heading" and potentially "modify" these programs. However, neither campus nor the University of California have announced any plans to adjust their current policies.
"UC has a duty to protect its students, its employees and the community and I'm sure they're going to continue to do that," Rogers said.
