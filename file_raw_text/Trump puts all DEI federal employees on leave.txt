Highlight: Executive order banning affirmative action paves way for mass layoffs and ‘adverse consequences’ for those who do not report those breaking new rules
Body


All federal employees who work on efforts to reduce discrimination and increase diversity have been put on paid leave and will eventually be sacked after President Trump signed an executive order banning affirmative action.
Trump has said that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes amount to “discrimination” and that he wanted to return to what he described as a “merit-based” system of hiring.
The executive order, signed on 

, dismantled affirmative action programmes that were first introduced under the presidency of Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
The Office of Personnel Management directed all government agencies to place DEI office employees on paid leave by 5pm ET (10pm GMT) on Wednesday and to remove taxpayer-funded websites that promoted their activities. All DEI training sessions, contracts with outside bodies and promotional campaigns must be stopped, according to the order.
Federal workers are being asked to report any programmes that continue to operate if they believe they have DEI content — or face undefined “adverse consequences”.
Federal agencies are being directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of November 5, the date of Trump’s election victory over Kamala Harris. By next Friday, January 31, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a “reduction-in-force action” against those federal workers.
The order included other social changes, including a mandate to the federal government to recognise only two sexes, males and females, which are part of what Trump’s team calls its “restoring sanity” agenda.
The order directs the federal government to use the term “sex” rather than “gender” and mandates the state department and others to ensure “that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas and global entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex”.
The order continues: “Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women’s domestic abuse shelters to women’s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and wellbeing.”
A number of leading companies have followed Trump’s lead and have pared back their own DEI initiatives.
Ford, Harley-Davidson, McDonald’s and Meta have all reduced their commitments to DEI programmes, in some cases after seeing a backlash from conservative customers.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the banking giants Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America had all come under pressure from groups opposed to greater DEI efforts.
Organisations such as the National Center for Public Policy Research, the National Legal and Policy Center and the Heritage Foundation, a think tank, have accumulated some shareholdings in the banks with a view to using their equity to challenge business practices they do not like.
Under President Biden, the federal government established a Chief Diversity Officers Council to oversee and co-ordinate the implementation of the DEI plans across the government. The government released its first DEI progress report in 2022 that included demographic data for the federal workforce, which is about 60 per cent white and 55 per cent male.
The council will be abolished under Trump.
