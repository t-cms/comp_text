Highlight: Dumbo and Peter Pan are among those affected as American corporations quickly fall into line with President Trump’s attacks on DEI programmes

Disney is revising its content advisories for films featuring outdated racial stereotypes as part of a broader retreat from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in response to the new Trump administration.
The updated disclaimers, which affect classic films such as 
                   Dumbo                   
 and 
                   Peter Pan,                   
 mark a shift from previous language acknowledging historical racism. 
In 2019, the company introduced warnings about “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of peoples or cultures” preceding the films. The new advisory will state: “This programme is presented as originally created and may contain stereotypes or negative depictions.”
The adjustment is one of several as Disney scales back DEI efforts, reflecting a wider corporate trend as companies reassess their commitments in the new political climate. An internal memo 

 reveals that Disney will also remove its “diversity & inclusion” performance metric for employees, replacing it with a broader “talent strategy” factor. 
Additionally, the company’s Reimagine Tomorrow website — intended to highlight initiatives supporting underrepresented communities — will be closed. The site came under fire in 2022 when a Republican commentator unearthed a meeting where an executive spoke about a “not at all secret gay agenda”.
The shift is part of a wave of corporate rollbacks on DEI under the Trump administration. The president has issued 

 targeting diversity policies in federal agencies, government contractors, and the military.

Last week Pete Hegseth, Trump’s secretary of defence, banned Black History Month celebrations and other “cultural awareness” events in a memo that he titled “Identity Months Dead at DoD”.
Google, whose chief executive, Sundar Pichai, attended the Trump inauguration, has removed black history months, women’s history months and Pride from online and mobile calendars. Users who want to have those holidays on their Google calendars must add them manually. The company said keeping the holidays had become “unsustainable”.
“Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries around the world,” Google said in a statement to The Guardian. “We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing — and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn’t scalable or sustainable.”
On Monday, Google Maps 

 to the Gulf of America. The change, which only affects people using the app in the US, follows Trump’s executive order over the weekend renaming the gulf in official government documents.
While users in Mexico will continue to see “Gulf of Mexico” on their maps, the rest of the world will see “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).” Google said the measure was part of “a longstanding practice” of using names from the federal government.
Meta, a company that once boasted about its commitment to fighting misinformation and enjoyed a reputation for its inclusivity programmes, has since removed its DEI team and dropped its fact-checking feature. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, was also present at the inauguration.
McDonald’s, Target, Walmart, Boeing and Harley Davidson are some of the other companies that have scaled back on DEI programmes.
Companies that have doubled down on their practices face an emboldened anti-DEI approach in Washington. The acronym has become a catchphrase liberally used by Republicans for a range of issues — from ad hominem attacks on underrepresented communities in high positions in government to Trump blaming them for the 

 last month.
