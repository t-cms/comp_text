Foundation Of Government Accountability Commends President Trump for Restoring Equality
* * *
Today, the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) commends the Trump administration for taking decisive action on Day One in overturning Biden's discriminatory "equity" policies. By ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to restoring equality under the law and preventing the unconstitutional discrimination promoted by Biden.
President Biden's executive orders demanding the federal government prioritize advancing racial equity, spawned more than 300 diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) projects across federal agencies. Some of these initiatives award grants and contracts based not on merit but purely on racial equity goals. The federal government is funneling a staggering $9.4 billion into these programs yearly with little to no evidence that they actually work.
President Trump's Executive Order will:
* Enforce Civil Rights Laws: The order mandates strict adherence to federal civil rights laws, eliminating race- and sex-based preferences and promoting equality based on merit and hard work.
* Terminate DEI Policies: This order revoked Biden-era executive orders promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies, deeming them unlawful and harmful to American Unity. All DEI employees will be put on paid leave.
* Change Federal Contracting: Affirmative action requirements for federal contractors are eliminated and new terms mandate compliance with anti-discrimination laws while not promoting DEI policies.
* Ensure Private Sector Compliance: Agencies are tasked with identifying and targeting sectors and organizations that violate civil rights laws with discriminatory DEI practices, with strategic enforcement plans to follow.
* Create Guidance for Education and Implementation: Federal agencies must provide guidance to educational institutions and implement the order while preserving First Amendment rights and lawful preferences for veterans and disabled individuals.
"Americans are tired of seeing nearly $10 billion of their hard-earned tax dollars get flushed down the drain on ineffective and discriminatory DEI programs," said Tarren Bragdon, President and CEO of the Foundation for Government Accountability. "I'm grateful to President Trump for his bold leadership and dedication to restoring equality on Day One of his presidency."
"President Trump has been at the forefront of the fight for equal treatment under the law, and the message from the American people is clear," Bragdon continued. "They've had enough of radical agendas that pit us against each other based on race. I look forward to working with the Trump administration in their efforts to return our nation to its core principle of equality."
