Highlight: President scapegoats diversity and inclusion initiatives while addressing air traffic disaster that left 67 deadPlane crash near Washington DC: what we know so far
Body


  used the   to attack his political enemies, claiming Democrats were responsible for declining standards in air traffic control and that the disaster “could have been” caused by diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the Federal Aviation Administration.
Trump turned what might have been a sombre a press conference into a baseless rant against DEI, despite no evidence of a link with the crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National airport, which involved an American Airlines jet and a US military helicopter.
The president was backed by the transportation secretary,  , who said “we can only accept the best and the brightest” in positions affecting passenger safety, and the defense secretary,  , who said: “The era of DEI is gone at the defense department and we need the best and brightest.”
Then came the vice-president,  , who claimed, “we want to hire the best people … actually competent enough to do the job”, and said without offering evidence that hundreds had sued the US government because “they would like to be air traffic controllers, but they were turned away because of the color of their skin”.
Trump claimed that “very powerful tests” for competence in air traffic control were “terminated” by .  He also claimed that when he was president between 2017 and 2021 the US “had a much higher standard [in air traffic control] than anybody else”.
Pressed on his citation of DEI as a cause of the crash, Trump said: “It just could have been.”
Asked how he could so quickly decide diversity was to blame, Trump said: “Because I have common sense, OK, and unfortunately, a lot of people don’t.”
Trump also mused about possible errors by the helicopter pilot.
Officials said   in the crash on Wednesday night. By late Thursday morning, 28 bodies had been retrieved from the Potomac River. The   were reported.
Since returning to the White House earlier this month, Trump has made attacks on   in federal government a central and performative part of his rush of hardline executive orders.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he quoted in familiar scattergun style from “various articles [that] appeared prior to my entering office”.
“And here’s one,” Trump said. “‘The FAA’s diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities.’ That is amazing. And then it says FAA … says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce, [they] said, ‘They want them in, and they want them, they can be air traffic controllers.’ I don’t think so. This was January 14, so that was a week before I entered office. They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA’s program.”
He appeared to be reading from a   published by Fox News.
Trump continued: “Brilliant people have to be in those positions, and their lives are actually shortened, very substantially shortened because of the stress where you have many, many planes coming into one target, and you need a very special talent and a very special genius to be able to do it.”
Asked if he would “fire some of the diversity hires in federal government”, Trump said: “I would say yes. If we find that people aren’t mentally competent … these are not people who should be doing these particular jobs.”
Trump had opened the briefing conventionally, with a moment of silence, then lamented “a dark and excruciating night in our nation’s capital and in our nation’s history, and a tragedy of terrible proportions”.
He also said he could “only begin to imagine the agony that [victims’ families were] feeling, nothing worse”, adding: “On behalf of the first lady, myself and 340 million Americans, our hearts are shattered alongside yours, and our prayers are with you now and in the days to come.
“We did not know what led to this crash but we have some very strong opinions and ideas … we’ll find out how this disaster occurred and we’ll ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. The FAA and the NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] and the US military will be carrying out a systematic and comprehensive investigation.”
But Trump was keener to divert blame. He said: “We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system. I changed the Obama [administration] standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary.
“You remember that. Only the highest aptitude. They have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. That was not so prior to [me] getting there.
“When I arrived in 2016, I made that change very early on, because I always felt this was a job that, and other jobs too, but this was a job that had to be superior intelligence, and we didn’t really have that. And we had it. And then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever before. Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse.”
Trump also took aim at Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was transportation secretary under Biden.
“He was a disaster,” Trump said. “He was a disaster as a mayor, he ran his city into the ground, and he’s a disaster now. He’s just got a good line of bullshit.”
Trump also said Buttigieg, who is gay, ran the transportation department into the ground “with his diversity”.
Amid Democratic outrage, Buttigieg called Trump’s remarks “despicable” and   : “As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying.
“We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew air traffic control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA. One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe.”
That was a reference to Trump’s   of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee.
Buttigieg said it was “time for the president to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again”.
