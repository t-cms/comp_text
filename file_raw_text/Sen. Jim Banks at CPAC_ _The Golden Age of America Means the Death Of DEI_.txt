Sen. Jim Banks at CPAC: "The Golden Age of America Means the Death Of DEI"
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Senator Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who founded the Anti-Woke Caucus in the House last congress, delivered a speech at CPAC on defeating wokeness. Below are key excerpts from his remarks:
On America entering the Golden Age:
"Today marks one month exactly since President Trump took office, kicking off the Golden Age of America. Within that short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud, and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the Deep State. He's directed the largest mass deportation operation in American history, making our communities safer. He's removed the "kick me" sign from the backs of our industries and our workers. Our adversaries and our partners have been put on notice. The era of taking advantage of America is over."
On dismantling DEI:
"Despite how extensively DEI polluted our institutions, President Trump, with the swipe of his pen, dismantled this Marxist ideology from the halls of our government. The Education Department under President Trump has given schools 14 days to end any practice that treats students differently because of their race or lose federal funding. A huge blow to DEI and a massive win for our kids. Maybe most importantly, DEI has been uprooted from our military... DEI is an attack on the American Dream. As the son of a factory worker who grew up in a trailer park who's now serving in the United States Senate, that American Dream is personal... DEI is the biggest threat to the American Dream, but the Golden Age of America means the death of DEI."
On the 'New Right':
"The New Right merges true conservatism with the interests of the People. President Trump and his administration boldly embody this new party. This administration had the nerve to stand up against corporate America, the media, the federal bureaucracy, Wall Street, the mainstream culture, the education system, the entire Democrat Party, and even weak Republicans on our side."
On Prosperity, Patriotism, and Strength coming back to Washington:
"This recent election in November was a referendum on the status quo. President Trump has led this country and this town into a new age. This isn't business-as-usual here in Washington. We're entering a time of American prosperity and peace that we haven't seen before. It's felt across the Heartland of America. Working people aren't used to their leaders being honest with them or prioritizing their needs. But that's what President Trump and the MAGA movement have achieved. The cancer of wokeness tried to undermine our national unity and destroy our culture. But it failed. We the People know what makes this country great. We know that our faith is in God, not the government. We know our society is strong when our families are strong."
