President Trump on Thursday appeared to blame diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for weakening safety following a deadly midair collision near Reagan National Airport.
Trump spoke to the press from the White House briefing room about the incident, which he called “a tragedy of terrible proportions.” But his solemn tone quickly gave way to lambasting the Biden and Obama administrations, taking aim specifically at hiring initiatives.
“Brilliant people have to be in those positions,” Trump said.
He cited efforts by the FAA to hire individuals with disabilities, including Dwarfism, missing limbs and intellectual disabilities.
“A group within the FAA…determined that the workforce was too white,” Trump said. “That they had concerted efforts to get the administration to change that and to change it immediately. This was in the Obama administration.”
Trump also blasted Pete Buttigieg, who served as Transportation secretary during the Biden administration.
“He’s a disaster now. He’s just got a good line of bullshit,” Trump said of Buttigieg. “Well he runs it, 45,000 people, and he’s run it right into the ground with his diversity.”
Trump in his first two weeks in office has  diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the government.
