On CNN This Morning, former FBI senior intelligence adviser and former CIA counterterrorism officer Philip Mudd shared his insights on several critical topics, including the Department of Justice's ongoing investigation into FBI agents involved in January 6th cases, CIA workforce buyouts, and the recent White House order for the CIA to send out an unclassified email listing recently hired employees.
Mudd expressed concern over the potential security risks of exposing the real names of new CIA hires, noting how foreign intelligence agencies, particularly China, could exploit this information. "You just gave the Chinese a gift," he said, explaining how seemingly innocuous data could be used in combination with other publicly available information to target CIA personnel.

The documents show $11,539 was to used by Trump in November 2019 to purchase software, CDs, tapes and records.
