BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: -- now sending her videos and new cards by the hundreds even students she taught decades ago and contributing to her new collection. Great story. Tomorrow on Special Report, the Senate considers President Trump's pick for Education Secretary. We'll cover it all. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. Here's Laura.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. As always, thank you for joining us. All right, right off the bat, we have a resistance alert. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Posting on X, former liberal Bill Ackman perfectly captured the current state of the Democratic Party and their media enablers, writing the fact that Democrats are fighting the first real effort to root out waste, fraud and abuse from our government, it's a very bad look from which one can only draw a negative inference. You doth protest too much, methinks. Bingo.
Now, Democrats went from being the party of the little guy, right, to being the party of the big bureaucracy. How is that going to make them more popular with the people? How will this work in the midterms? It's no more Save the Whales. Forget about that. It's Save the Bureaucracy. Put that on a bumper sticker. Now, even their protests are falling flat. Now everybody watching, cover your pets ears.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We'll fight against DOGE; we'll fight against Elon Musk. No, Elon scab within our roles, we'll fight from dawn to dusk. He's coming for our unions, he wants us all to fail, he wants us to bow to him, but we want him in jail.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Is it over, mommy, stop, stop. Oh, my God, I guess none of that USAID money went to singing lessons, I would have actually supported that. All right. But seriously, if you thought the resistance was just limited, though, to hating on Trump. Well, you're sorely mistaken.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We won't stop until Elon Musk and his DOGE cronies are kicked out of every power.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elon Musk, two more words, you're fired.
REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): We're going to tell Trump get out of the way and take your thieving Elon Musk with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK, if ignorance is bliss, then why is she so nasty? Now, we're supposed to believe that the richest man in America only volunteered for this thankless job because what he wanted to skim some off the top. Are they kidding me? Now, when you see Maxine and friends stranded on the side of the road. Keep driving. They're totally out of gas. Now, young people aren't buying their fake outrage anymore.
(VIDEO PLAYING)
INGRAHAM: And they're turning off minorities.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're trying to prevent a government audit, because some of you really are trying to stay out of prison. We see the game now. You all been out here telling us that the game was rigged against certain people. Well, now we found out who the people that were rigging the game were. Congratulations. You all are never going to win another political race ever again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: All right, that guy is fun. But because what the party has come to symbolize, the reason they're turning people off is the people they represent now sound like this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: If you say that you're afraid of Trump, and that's why you don't want city to be -- the city to be a space, safe space for trans people, you better prepare for trans people to make this a very unsafe space.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK, that has to be a Republican plan. I don't even believe that - - is that really -- is that real? OK, in Worcester, Massachusetts, Democrat officials have decided to resist by declaring the city a sanctuary for transgender and non-binary people. Big opposition to Trump. Because that's exactly what Americans have been clamoring for. Now, more on that in just a little bit, but the resistance, which is mostly now funded by unions and rich progressives is just one endless parade of victims. It's non-stop fear-mongering when what Americans should truly fear is the possibility that Democrats ever get power to screw things up again. A month into this Trump presidency, and their response is just a broken record of old toxic grievances, as we've seen so often before, Democrats think that they can buy enough votes to win.
Of course, buy the votes among whom. Well, among government workers and African Americans, because nothing screams 2025 like another push for reparations.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): And for those that would say we need to just get over it, that's interesting, when as a nation, you are benefiting right now from an economy that was built on the brutalized backs and the indignities and the horrors of chattel slavery in our African ancestors.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: They should start their own eye glass line. Those are pretty cool glasses. But asking for money from people who never own slaves in order to give it to people who never were slaves, again, it's just more phony indignation, more guilt tripping of white America. But it's so much easier, isn't it, than fixing the cities that her party wrecked over the past 60 years, that would be difficult. And you know what's actually funny? We have to look for the humor here. The party is desperately defending unelected bureaucrats, but it's also pretending to be offended by the actions of an unelected Elon Musk.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): They have relinquished their constitutional duties over to an unelected bureaucrat, someone who no one went out to vote for, and absolutely he is occupying the Oval Office, as we saw yesterday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Of course, this is ridiculous, ridiculous on its face. First of all, I thought the Constitution was racist. Now you want everyone to abide by it, but the only occupation that Americans need to be worried about comes in the form of unaccountable government workers who have just parked themselves in powerful positions for years, sometimes decades, and most of whom never cared if the taxpayer's hard earned money was being well spent.
Is this an occupation of in confidence, or is it a cabal of corruption? Or maybe it's a little bit of both, because who knew that weak ID verification in government programs could lead to astounding levels of waste?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HAYWOOD TALCOVE, CEO, LEXISNEXIS SPECIAL SERVICES: My number right now between federal, state and local government is you can save $1 trillion a year by simply putting in front end identity verification, eliminating self-certification and monitoring the back end of the programs that are providing the benefits.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK, trillion with a T. Every day, it's something but this President campaigned on addressing all of this once and for all, and today we were reminded he's not letting up.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's so many transactions, thousands and thousands of transactions, and if you don't have people that care, you're going to lose control. And that's what's happened, and we've caught it. Now, what we caught is billions and billions of dollars, but it's a tiny fraction of the real number, because you can never catch the real number, because people have gotten away with tremendous amounts of money.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now all the resistance has is just contrived moral outrage. They have Astro turf protests with lame chance, a lot of huffing and puffing and hyperbole from the squad, and of course, they have their lawsuits, and they hope to resist through judicial fiat, because for them, even temporarily slowing the President's agenda is a victory.
Meanwhile, expect the President to do what he did last time they used lawfare to try to stop him. He will keep going, and he will keep taking his case directly to the American people until the Democrats lose even more ground. Rather than resisting Trump and Musk, liberals should have resisted the urge to repeat the mistakes they made in 2024, but they're addicts. They're addicts to outrage, and that's the Angle.
Joining me now, Alina Habba, Counselor to President Trump. Alina, thank you for joining us tonight. Now there was a win, at least temporarily, for the White House and DOGE, a federal judge cleared the way for President Trump's plan to downsize the federal workforce with these kind of deferred resignations. The judge ruled on the basics of --basis of standing, saying that the government employee union didn't have standing to bring the case. But your reaction to some good news.
ALINA HABBA, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, it's another win for President Trump. And like you said, they're addicts. They're addicted to lawfare. We know this. They are not accepting the change in the administration, and it's ironic, really to watch. But I will say this, we did win today. They allowed us to move forward with the very generous plan that the President proposed, which is that you need to come to work if you're paid by the American people. And if you're a federal employee, I show up to work every day, and if you choose not to do so, that's your prerogative. Guess what? We'll even give you up until October's pay, no problem, but you got to go.
And it's funny that they even tried to stop this, really, it's crazy to even say that, but today we had a win despite their lawfare, despite them trying to stop the administration, who was mandated on November 5th to do exactly this, stop government waste and have the federal government work for the American people.
INGRAHAM: Well, Teachers' Union President Randi Weingarten, I know you guys text all day long, Alina, she went after DOGE today. Check it out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT, THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: What is now coming down the pike in this aura of efficiency, it's not efficiency, it's evisceration. It is an attempt to take the funding and take the rights away from each and every child.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Alina, we know that our public school students continue to lose ground, especially in blue cities across America. And Randy Weingarten thinks the real villain here is the guy trying to make the system more efficient, because she's for the kids.
HABBA: Yes, the only thing we're dissolving, to use her words, the disillusion. The only thing we are dissolving right now is pocketing people, lobbyists and perhaps corrupt, God forbid, politicians who have their -- are being funded by things like pharmaceutical companies and not caring about things that really matter, woke, DEI, CRT, that's all gone now, and we're going to make this education in our country the way it should be, which is strong. We should not have children who can't read. We should not be weak in math. And that's what we have seen in the last administration. And it is a priority for President Trump to have these children educated.
But we know that the Department of Education, frankly, wasn't cutting it. So maybe if they took their energy instead of, you know, singing songs, and whoever wrote that, that crazy song that I heard them and Chuck and everybody, I mean, that was just bizarre. If they took that energy and used their time more wisely to help our children and the youth of America, the country would be better, and that's what President Trump is going to do. I'm sorry they're upset about, I'm not really sure why.
INGRAHAM: Yes, Alina, are you surprised that they really are serving up the cold leftovers of the 2024 campaign. So again, Musk, Nazi, heard that, Trump a dictator, autocrat. Now it's this, you don't care about the kids, but they -- and the trans stuff. I mean, really, it's stunning that with all the money they spend on these consultants, they make millions of dollars in consultancy fees. This is what they come up with.
HABBA: Yes, I think -- I recommend, Laura, that we get them a team of DOGE for the Democrat Party, and perhaps they could look at their own spending on their PR consultants, because they're not winning the American people over right now. You know to get up and scream and yell just isn't working, because you're not credible. You lost credibility in the last administration. It's obvious. We know we see our children. I see my children. They should not be falling behind other countries. America is going to be first. We're going to get ahead.
And the fact that they're screaming and yelling, it doesn't surprise me, Laura, you know it, but it gives us something to laugh about while they sing songs.
INGRAHAM: Now, Pam Bondi, the new Attorney General. She had something to say about the sanctuary states today. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PAM BONDI (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL: New York has chosen to prioritize illegal aliens over American citizens. They're giving a green light to any illegal alien in New York, where law enforcement officers cannot check their identity if they pull them over. If you are a state not complying with federal law, you're next, get ready.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Alina, they're protecting illegals in places like New York, still in places like Massachusetts, other blue states should, should other states take this as a warning from the Attorney General?
HABBA: Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. And by the way, you said it best. They're blue states. This is what they do best. Tish James has used Donald Trump and continues to use him with Governor Hochul as a platform for their voice. Well, their voice, they try, you know, frankly, I mean, we should thank them, because their voices and their lawfare is why I'm sitting here, and the President is in the Oval right now. But it doesn't work. So here's the thing, Pam Bondi has a very clear message to an executive order that the President signed that we are not going to have these sanctuary cities that immigration, safety and the fentanyl crisis are going to be a priority that this administration focuses on.
So when Letitia James ignores it and when Governor Hochul ignores it and the DMV, we're going to come after you. You cannot do that.
INGRAHAM: Well, they want to thwart this agenda in any way possible, but an important win again, at least in one of these decisions today in Massachusetts. Alina, thank you very much. And coming up, you got bright blue hair, you got white gloves, right? You got a lot of shrieking. This is the state of the resistance, because the trans resistance, they seem to be just losing their mind, if they have -- ever had much of a mind about Trump wanting to protect girls and, of course, keep men out of women's bathrooms.
So, a Massachusetts town going so far as declaring itself, as I mentioned in the Angle, a sanctuary city for transgender and gender diverse people. The city council voted in favor of the sanctuary status 9 to 2. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: I don't want to spend an hour applying glitter on my face so that you will hear and see me.
UNKNOWN: I need the city to protect me because the federal government won't. And if you think you're afraid of Trump, you should see how afraid of Trump I am.
UNKNOWN: It demands a response from our elected officials to say, we recognize that you are under attack, and in Worcester, we are going to protect you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now, Jim Polito, who is a Conservative Boston-Area Radio Host. Jim, great to see you. I remember --
JIM POLITO, CONSERVATIVE BOSTON-AREA RADIO HOST: Great to see you, Laura.
INGRAHAM: -- Worcester, one of my brothers went to Worcester poly tech. Now this was like a blue collar, a factory town, I know Worcester really well. How did this happen --
POLITO: Laura, I grew up there. It happens because, because the town, the city has gone crazy, Laura, my pronouns on this one are, I can't go back there. I mean, this group last night put up such a fit. Actually, they were the most intolerant. They were threatening violence. And wait until you hear this. Wait until you hear this. Two of the counselors who voted no, one happens to be Jewish, the tolerant crowd here, who was looking for acceptance, started yelling at him with a fake German accent. They called him a fascist, and they started making pig noises, oink, oink, this man who voted against this, his parents were Holocaust survivors who moved to Worcester in 1949.
I mean, this is out of control, Laura, and you're right. I grew up in Worcester. I don't live there anymore. It used to be a blue collar city. My brother went to WPI too. It is no longer that. And Jim McGovern, I think you know, is the Congressman from Worcester, and he's partly responsible for this transformation of what was a working class, quiet city, and then we have this kind of craziness in front of the council.
INGRAHAM: Well, what I have to remind everyone watching tonight is that the Democrats, for years, claim that Republicans were pushing the envelope on protests after January 6th, Charlottesville. That's all they ever said, and it was, oh, they're the violent ones. They're the threatening people. Well, who's threatening now using pig noises to a Jewish American who has the right to vote any way he wants on an issue like this. That's, again, that's not threatening.
POLITO: Any other group that had come in front of the council and behaved the way that they did with threats of violence too, Laura, and some of the soundbites you'll see, they would have been tossed out. Let's say Jim Polito showed up and said, I want to make this a sanctuary city for white males who are practicing Catholics, conservative and drive Harleys. I'd be thrown out. We wouldn't even be entertained. We would be thrown out. Nine members of this council.
INGRAHAM: I think we have more sound -- let's play one more soundbite. I don't know if we have the one that you're describing, which I wish, yes, but we do. Let's just play a little bit more from this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: I'm shaking right now. I don't want to be here. I'm sorry. Am I taking too long, pleading for my life.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please wrap up.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
POLITO: You know there's --
INGRAHAM: I mean --
POLITO: Laura, there's the other one with the purple hair --
INGRAHAM: It's a fake victim mentality, it's so phony.
POLITO: It is, the one with the purple hair said, if we don't feel safe here, you're not going to feel safe here. How is that tolerance? How are -- these people who don't want hate and can I just add one more thing, Laura, that's the cherry on top of this. Why do we need a sanctuary city in a state where the governor is a member of the LGBTQ community.
INGRAHAM: I think --
POLITO: The governor herself.
INGRAHAM: -- it's pretty much a sanctuary for the fringe, and that's apparently what the great state of Massachusetts wants and time to take back New England, Jim, I've been saying that for a long time. I'm from Connecticut. My whole family is from Boston. Got to take it back. It's absurd what's happening. Shouldn't have to write those states off every presidential election. Jim, thank you very much.
All right, the Ukraine gravy train that's about to come to a screeching halt. Senator Josh Hawley joins us next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN (D), 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: All our allies agreed, Ukraine's future lies in NATO. We are going to be there as long as that takes.
KAMALA HARRIS (D), FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We will be with you for as long as it takes.
JANET YELLEN, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: We will collectively stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So much, for as long as it takes, as long as it takes to end this madness. President Trump spoke with both Putin and Zelenskyy today, another promise made will be kept. There will be peace in Ukraine.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We're going to work toward getting it ended, and as fast as possible. President Putin said that he wants it to end. He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. We talked about the possibility. I mentioned it of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing, and I think we'll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not too distant future.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining us now is Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. Senator, you and I have talked about this now for years, the carnage, which I don't think Americans or most people around the world really have a real handle on, but it's in the hundreds of thousands dead from this war with no outcome that's positive in sight. Your reaction to the news today that the United States will not push for Ukraine to become a NATO member.
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Huge relief. It's just, it's common sense, and Laura, it's one another example of President Trump doing what he promised to do on the campaign trail. But let's be honest, Joe Biden saying, you know, we're with you as long as it takes. That was never their plan. I've said this before. They were -- they've been telling members of Congress, the Biden administration, they told members of Congress for years that there would have to be a negotiated settlement. They just didn't have any idea how to do it. And now you've got Donald Trump, who is owning up to reality and saying, OK, I will do it. I will end this war. And I predict this to you, Laura, I think Ukraine will come out better with Donald Trump at the helm of these negotiations than they ever would have done if Joe Biden or Kamala had been President. They have no idea what to do. Putin didn't respect them. That's why they invaded in the first place. Trump is on the job, and he's going to get it done.
INGRAHAM: Well, think about it. You have Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, going to meet with Zelenskyy. You have Vance and Rubio going over to Munich to meet as well with, I guess, Russian counter parts. It looks like they are dispatching all the right people in an all-out push to bring peace to the region, which, again, I think the American people have wanted for some time. There was no sense that Ukraine was going to win this war, or that Russia was going to have a resounding victory. It was just a stalemate of death.
HAWLEY: Yes, what it looks like now is the administration is actually serious about doing something. What a refreshing change. The Biden administration hid behind these platitudes and did nothing. They had no plan to win the war. They had no plan to end the war. They had no plan for anything. Instead, to your point, they just let tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people be killed, and they spent our tax dollars without end. And now Trump who has a plan. He is on top of it. He is dispatching his top team to do it. He is personally engaged.
Laura, we need this war to end, and the unlimited guarantees that the last administration was making will to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on this forever. That was absurd, and I'm glad President Trump is putting a stop to it.
INGRAHAM: Do you think that America should in some way be reimbursed if, knowing Trump, he's going to try to figure out a way for the American taxpayer to recoup some of the money blown in Ukraine, whether it's some energy situation or deal with Russia or Ukraine, or maybe together. I wouldn't be surprised if that's what ends up happening.
HAWLEY: You know what else needs to happen is, we need accounting of every single tax dollar that's been spent over there, because remember, right now, we have zero, because Congress never would vote for an audit of the money, and the White House, the Biden White House never would do one. We need to know exactly how this money has been spent all these years. And if you think USAID is a corrupt thing, just wait until we see how our money has been spent. We need to know it. And I'm glad the President is going to bring this to a close.
INGRAHAM: Yes, the Pentagon should be next. Senator, thank you as always. And when we come back, Democrats want you to know that after four years of decline, they really care about the economy. Vivek Ramaswamy, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: How many times did Democrats try to reassure all of us over the past four years that Bidenomics is working? How many times did they tell us, just be patient, it's all going to take a little time, but eventually the magic would unfold. But now with Biden and Dr. Jill back home in Wilmington, and now that Trump's back in the Oval Office, suddenly things have taken a dark turn.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Americans woke up this morning to bad news for their bank accounts. They woke up to a grim reality that Donald Trump is not going to keep his promise to lower costs. They woke up. Americans woke up to an era of Trump-flation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Trump-flation? Oh, poor Chuck. Now let's set the record straight. Inflation rose to 3 percent in January, but wait, who was president for the majority of that month?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDEN: That's Bidenomics in action. Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now, Vivek Ramaswamy, former presidential candidate, founding member of DOGE. Vivek, great to see you. So, President Trump, as has been in basically a month or so, yet the Democrats are making it seem like there should be monumental change on the economy right away, immediately. So, when can we start seeing relief, Vivek?
VIVEK RAMASWAMY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I mean, the right answer, Laura, first of all, these claims from Democrats are asinine. President Trump took office on January 20th and they're complaining about January numbers as though President Trump is responsible for that.
Here's a basic lesson on inflation. Democrats would do well to remember. There's two drivers of inflation. Number one is government overspending, and then the government having to print money and inflate away the value of the dollar in the process. And number two is supply constraints on energy and housing and other goods in our economy.
Two things have happened in the last several weeks. Number one is we're relieving those supply constraints. President Trump is rolling back those regulatory constraints on energy production, and really production of everything in the United States. And when it comes to government spending, we are seeing the cuts that he's focused on making. So, it makes absolutely no sense to blame President Trump for the two to three weeks that he's been in office for inflation numbers that went up while Biden was actually in office, driving the very causes of that inflation.
Of course they know that, at least the smart ones do. But they're trying to trick the public. The public won't be fooled so easily this time is my bet.
INGRAHAM: Now your involvement with DOGE is well documented. But are you surprised that the Democrats response, we're doing a whole fever reno this show on that the lane resistance to this, we're you surprise they're trotting out the same old tired lines of, you know, Musk said, you know, autocrat, or Trump said this, or someone's a nazi, or -- I mean, they're taking food from babies and cancer cures from medical patients. Is that the best they can do?
RAMASWAMY: I'm not surprised. I think it is the best they can do right now. What I'm rooting for, Laura, is a Democratic Party that actually has a vision of some sort. It may not be a vision that you and I agree with. But go back to talking about how do you dress economic inequality or other substantive issues. That would at least be better for the country even if we disagree with their solutions, rather than resorting to the standard fascist, autocrat name-calling. It's just not useful.
Frankly, if you ask most Americans across the country, do you think that there's too much red tape in this country or too little red tape in this country? Not a single person is going to tell you there's too little red tape, not even actual Democrat voters. A lot of people are going to tell you that there's too much red tape.
So, the fact that President Trump and DOGE and Elon and the entire new administration is focused on cutting red tape, I think is a good thing, both for the American people and for the economy because that stimulates economic growth.
The Democratic Party is lost. They got a shellacking last November. The reality is they would do better to look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves what they actually stand for. What is their vision? Is it economic inequality? Is it something else? Go figure that out. And until then, I think the name calling is falling flat as it should.
INGRAHAM: Meanwhile, everybody was watching, Vivek, the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, today interest rates were the big topic. But he's still defending their proclamation, early on, when they said that inflation would be transitory. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: We thought the inflation was transitory. I can show you forecast from the end of 2021 by us, by staff, by the blue chip. Everybody thought it was going to be transitory, that's why we didn't raise rates.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Is that satisfactory for you?
RAMASWAMY: It's not. And the dirty little secret in financial markets, Laura, is the reason people pay attention to every little word of the Federal Reserve is not because they have some unique insight. It's because markets are looking for how the Federal Reserve is often going to mess it up next.
These people have messed it up royally for the last 25 years since the academics took over the Federal Reserve and the managerial class in the late 1990's. They've actually been adverse to the interests of American workers. They've been trying to balance inflation and unemployment, mostly doing a terrible job on both. It's like trying to hit two darts, two targets on a dartboard with one arrow, badly missing on both.
The reality is the Federal Reserve needs to go back to one purpose of stabilizing the U.S. dollar as a unit of measurement. And by the way, they don't need 23,000 employees to do that, which is what they have today. They could have a 90 percent headcount reduction and, frankly, do a better job so none of those excess headcount is going to find these new tasks to pursue.
INGRAHAM: Another DOGE target. Another, you're still doing DOGE, I love it. It's another target. Vivek, awesome to see you. Thank you so much. All right, the word of the day coming up. It's an expletive. And the JFK files are being released, so what documents might be next? Raymond Arroyo has answers. Seen and Unseen is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's time for Seen and Unseen, where we reveal the stories behind the headlines. For that, we turn to Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo. All right, Raymond, there is a curious word that keeps popping up this week, no matter where you turn.
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, and it's not a pretty one, Laura. Look, for whatever reason, we're becoming crasser and crassers of people. Laura, I hate it when folks yell in public the F-word or speak on the phone loudly and they're cursing. It normalizes moronic communication and it dumbs everybody down. Use better words.
That said, this was Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: In the last Congress, Chairwoman Green literally showed a (BLEEP) pic in our oversight congressional hearing. So, I thought I'd bring one as well. Now this, of course, we know is President Elon Musk. He's also the world's richest man. He was the biggest political donor in the last election. He has billions of dollars in conflicts of interest.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: How stupid.
ARROYO: I wish we would have cut that shorter, but I think this has to be the word of the day, Laura. It must be on the DNC Morning Facts. Over on CNN, Governor Chris Sununu was debating the waste DOGE is located and the need to make real cuts. Anderson Cooper went right for the D word.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Some of the details that have come out, like the, you know, $59 million spent on luxury hotels, it's actually not --
UNKNOWN: Giving money for migrants? That's OK now?
UNKNOWN: No, I'm not saying it's OK. Don't put words in my mouth.
UNKNOWN: So, would you stop that? Would you stop that process?
UNKNOWN: Don't be a (BLEEP). The portrayal -- what I'm saying is the portrayal by him is just not factually accurate.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: This is -- it's so low, Laura.
INGRAHAM: Is this it? I mean, this is where we are right now? OK.
ARROYO: Well, I mean, look, and you know, it what it reveals, and I know people talk like this, and we've got podcasts that are, you know, uninhibited. But we, as a culture, we should do better for our children. And we certainly should show a more expansive vocabulary than collapsing into the familiar curse words of the day.
I mean, Anderson Cooper, his defense --
INGRAHAM: And first of all, when back to Garcia, though, back to Garcia, when they put that picture of Elon Musk up in the white tie, I mean, Musk looked great in that picture. If you're Elon Musk and you, OK. Show that -- he looked fantastic in that photo. Why? It's such a dumb move. So stupid.
ARROYO: This is Congress. You know, this is Congress. We can do better than this. Mount a real argument. And look, in Anderson Cooper's defense, he and his producers, they did at least feel contrition over his D-move.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: I want to apologize. I was mean. I was rude to you. And I never - -
UNKNOWN: Are you kidding? I grew up with seven brothers and sisters and I'm a Sununu.
UNKNOWN: No, but I apologize.
UNKNOWN: No, no.
UNKNOWN: It's not -- I don't know why I said that. I really do.
UNKNOWN: We're all friends.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Time to delete it.
ARROYO: Yeah, well, don't say it in the first case, then you won't have to apologize. Look, Laura, as you know, the president declassified all the government files related to the JFK assassination, and guess what? The FBI just announced they've discovered 2,400 files they didn't realize were related to the assassination.
And look, there's a lot that could be there, including the head of the CIA's covert activities in Miami, his files, the alleged mob boss in New Orleans, Carlos Marcelo, his jailhouse confessions, lots there. But it made me wonder, perhaps we'll soon have access to other government files, like this one. Protocols for removing Biden from stage when he's lost.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Or perhaps we'll see the file on how to reboot senators in case of emergencies.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Oh, wait, I forgot to mention one thing. Just a little news. Last night I talked to a few of the governors, and tonight we will be on the phone with the governors.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Or one there's a lot of interest in, Laura. The government responds if extraterrestrials get elected to Congress. I'd love to see that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: No government should be run by continuing resolutions. They write the bill. They post the bill. Back and forth. Forth and back.
UNKNOWN: This is thievery. This is gangsterism.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Nothing speaks to the future like Maxine Waters and Rosa DeLauro. That screams future. OK. Now the government files aren't the only secrets that are about to be spilled. It looks like an arbitrator has been appointed in your favorite Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni case, Raymond. Wow.
ARROYO: Yeah. Well, you remember, Lively alleged that her director and co- star Baldoni sexually harassed her. Now he refutes that. And he contends Lively used the accusation to destroy his reputation and take control of his movie, along with her husband, Ryan Reynolds.
Well, now an interview from 2022 has emerged, and the plot is thickening. This is Blake Lively. Before she signed onto, It Ends With Us, and recall, she rewrote and reedited Baldoni's film.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: I wanted to be a part of the storytelling, that I wanted to be a part of the narrative, whether that be in the writing, in the costume design, in creating the character. When I went in the meetings, I would just seem like I'm just there to be the actor and ready to get the gig. I wouldn't reveal that I actually need to have authorship in order to feel fulfilled.
So, I think that for them, sometimes that might have felt like a rug pull because you're like, you're trying to assert yourself into something that we didn't hire you to do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: You're like the authorship.
ARROYO: Yeah, well, that's going to show up at trial, no doubt. And she tonight subpoenaed a bunch of cell carriers on a PR firm that worked for Baldoni, who also sued her.
INGRAHAM: I wish I cared. I wish I cared about either one of them and their ongoing spat. I know other people do. I don't care at all about these people. But Raymond, thank you. Great to see you. It is almost MAHA time. Jillian Michaels is here next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: And now we bring you another episode of, As the Resistance Sputters.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: And if he is confirmed to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the American people will ultimately pay the price with their health.
UNKNOWN: He threatens literally to make America sick. Whether it's make America sick again, or just make America sicker.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: RFK Jr. I mean they just -- I don't even think they believe what they're saying anymore. It doesn't sound like it. It's kind of half- hearted. And we're one step closer to make America healthy again. The Senate advancing RFK Jr.'s nomination for HHS secretary to a final vote tomorrow morning.
Joining me now, Jillian Michaels, health and wellness expert. Now, Jillian, there are still apparently no Senate Democrats brave enough to support a more commonsense approach to healthcare. What do you think they're afraid of?
JILLIAN MICHAELS, HEALTH AND WELLNESS EXPERT: I think they're resisting no matter what. I mean, you saw the senators vote along party lines. But what I can tell you is that all politicians are forced to take money from special interests. And yet, the Republicans, they fell into line. They voted to confirm Kennedy. And the Democrats didn't.
And I promise you that this is one of those 80-20 issues, 80 percent of the country wants to see change in healthcare. People are taking note and they're not going to forget it. And they got shellacked, as your previous guest Vivek said, for reasons just like this one, in my opinion.
INGRAHAM: Well, and it's -- what's amazing is that mothers, young people, minorities, this is an issue that kind of brings together a lot of different groups of people. And I think it's fascinating. There's, you know, crunchy granola types with kind of more traditional, you know, conservatives. That's a good thing. I mean, why should it be so bifurcated left, right all the time?
MICHAELS: It shouldn't. It's a great thing. It's because we are all human beings at the end of the day. Health shouldn't be political. The fact that it has become a political football is unfortunate. But the key now, if I was a politician, would be standing on the right side of history. And it's very clear that advocating for the health of every single American is that right side.
INGRAHAM: Well, Maggie Hassan isn't too happy about this. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: In a different time, in a different political moment, with a different president, members of this chamber would have joined together to resoundingly reject Mr. Kennedy's nomination. In fact, in a different time, where qualifications and character mattered, Mr. Kennedy's nomination would never have made it to the floor.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, to that you say, Jillian?
MICHAELS: To that I say, why don't we look at who's currently, or previously, hopefully, as of tomorrow, running the HHS, a lawyer, a lobbyist, Xavier Becerra, who moved to remove all age limits for gender reassignment drugs and surgery. But no alarm, like what qualifications are there for that one? You're not terrified of that?
I mean, this is absolutely grandstanding shenanigans to be with your party, and I really don't think it's forgivable and I don't think people will forget it.
INGRAHAM: It's insanity. Jillian, we're going to have you back just for health and wellness tips. OK? We're going to go really practical with you, I hope next time you join us. Thank you so much.
All right. That's it for us tonight. Don't forget to tune in tomorrow night, 7 P.M. Eastern, for my exclusive with RFK Jr. It'll be the first after the Senate votes on his nomination. Check me out on social media. Special photo going up after the show. Jesse is next.
