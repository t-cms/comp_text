Independent Women Applauds Trump's Executive Action To Eliminate DEI From The Military
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Independent Women applauds President Donald J. Trump for taking decisive action to eliminate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) from the military and restore its core mission to protect American interests.
Meaghan Mobbs, director of Independent Women's Center for American Safety and Security, said:
"As the director of the Center for American Safety and Security at Independent Women and an Army veteran from a family with a distinguished history of military service, I fully support the recent executive actions refocusing our military on its core mission: deterring aggression and, if necessary, decisively winning wars.
"The military exists to protect our nation and its interests. To achieve this, we must prioritize readiness, cohesion, and lethality. Policies or programs that divert attention from these goals weaken our effectiveness and jeopardize our ability to operate as a unified force.
"In the face of growing threats from Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, we must focus exclusively on preparedness and operational excellence. Trust and unity, built through shared values and a clear mission, are vital to battlefield success.
"The executive orders to eliminate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and address the challenges presented by an oftentimes medically-complex condition that frequently results in a non-deployable status represent a step toward strengthening unit cohesion and restoring focus on warfighting capabilities. Every initiative must serve the purpose of enhancing readiness and effectiveness.
"Our service members deserve a military rooted in meritocracy, accountability, and excellence. By prioritizing these principles, we honor their sacrifices and uphold the security of our nation."
