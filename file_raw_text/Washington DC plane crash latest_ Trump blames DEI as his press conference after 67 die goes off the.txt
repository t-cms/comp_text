President Donald Trump blamed DEI policies for the deadly collision between the    and an  regional jet in Washington, D.C. 
"You have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers," he said, before quoting articles regarding the Federal Aviation Administration's DEI push before he took office.
"Brilliant people have to be in those positions," the president said, later saying diversity hiring "could have been" linked to the crash. Earlier, he said officials weren't sure what led to the collision, in which 67 people died. 
The military helicopter, flown by "fairly experienced" crew members, was conducting "a required annual night evaluation," Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said. 
At least 28 bodies have been found as of Thursday morning. All 67 aboard the two aircraft are presumed dead. 
All flights .'s Ronald Reagan National Airport were resumed at 11 a.m. Thursday. Video footage showed the moment to the aircraft collided in the D.C. nighttime sky.

The International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations, a Montreal-based federation of professional associations, organizations, and guilds of air traffic control personnel, issued a statement, saying it was standing "in solidarity" with the air traffic controllers" involved in the tragedy.
The International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations (IFATCA) extends its deepest condolences to all those affected by the tragic  accident at Washington National Airport in Washington, DC.  
We stand in solidarity with the air traffic controllers at the Washington National air traffic control tower, Potomac TRACON  and the members of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) during this difficult time. We acknowledge the immense challenges they face in the aftermath of such incidents and remain committed to providing support as needed throughout both the grieving process and the investigation.  
As always, we urge the public to refrain from speculation. A thorough, independent investigation is essential to establishing the facts and identifying lessons that can enhance aviation safety. Preserving the integrity of this process is crucial to maintaining trust, accountability, and the highest standards of safety within the aviation community and across the aviation system.

"This is undoubtedly the worst day of my life," Timothy Lilley told . His 28-year-old son Sam Lilley was one of two pilots who lost their lives in the mid-air collision on Wednesday night.
His son recently became engaged, he said.
Timothy, who was an Army helicopter pilot for two decades, weighed in on the deadly crash.
"In the '90s, I used to fly in and out of the Pentagon regularly, and I can tell you if you are flying on the route over the Potomac and wearing night vision goggles, it's going to be very hard to see that plane. If you're not wearing the goggles, then you might have a chance," he said. 
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said earlier that the "fairly experienced" crew members on the Black Hawk helicopter were wearing night vision goggles.
The grieving father added:  "From what I can see, those guys turned right into the jet. I think the PSA jet was doing everything right. The Army pilot made a grave error. It hurts me because those are my brothers, and now my son is dead."

Crews working to retrieve the passengers of the American Airlines jet and the army helicopter that collided and crashed into the Potomac on Wednesday night have to contend with the dangerously cold waters of the Potomac River. 
Water temperatures between 33 and 36 degrees were reported near the crash site shortly after the incident, which is believed to have taken the lives of all who were involved. Just a degree below is considered to be freezing. 
"At these frigid water temperatures, the human body's core temperature quickly drops. Exhaustion or unconsciousness can occur in as little as 15 to 30 minutes," AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin explained in a statement.

"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency's website,"  Trump said at Thursday morning's briefing.
The program allowed for the hiring of individuals with a number of conditions, including hearing and vision issues, paralysis, epilepsy and "dwarfism."
Trump said air traffic controllers needed to be "psychologically superior."
"They have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses," he said. "You can't have regular people doing their job."

A skating pair who won medals at the championships narrowly avoided being on the flight with other US skaters that ended in a deadly crash.
Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko, who are skating partners, flew home from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas on Monday, before traveling on to another competition in Canada, the head of their training school told The Independent.
Jamal Othman, director of The Ice Academy for World's Champions, confirmed the pair are safe, contradicting reports in Russian media that they were feared to have been on board the tragic American Airlines plane.
After winning a number of medals at the competition in Wichita, including two silvers as a pair, Ms Carreira and Mr Ponomarenko competed in London, Ontario on Wednesday, said Mr Othman, who is also a Swiss former competitive figure skater.
U.S. Figure Skating confirmed that the American Airlines plane crashed that night with a number of athletes, coaches and family members on board who were all travelling back from the National Development Camp held in conjunction with the US Figure Skating Championships.

With three fatal events involving passenger jets in five weeks, it is understandable that some people will conclude that risks are increasing, writes The Independent's travel correspondent, Simon Calder. 
In fact, this decade is so far much safer than any previous spell. The three crashes have had entirely different causes, all of which are extremely rare: Azerbaijan Airlines, shot down by Russian anti-aircraft fire over Grozny on Christmas Day.

Analysis: How common are mid-air collisions?
09:23
,
James Liddell
Thankfully, they are extremely rare, says The Independent's travel correspondent, Simon Calder. 
On average there has been one per year so far this century, most of them involving small private aircraft and - or - helicopters.
All pilots and air-traffic controllers are focused on avoiding other "traffic" in the skies. All large passenger aircraft are equipped with a traffic collision avoidance system, known as TCAS.
If a potential threat is identified, the system will issue a "resolution advisory". Typically one aircraft will be instructed to climb and the other told to descend. Pilots are required to perform the maneuver specified by the resolution advisory even if it conflicts with instructions from air-traffic controllers.
The Washington tragedy involved a military helicopter, which has very different operational characteristics from a fixed-wing aircraft. It is not known if it was fitted with TCAS, but in any case, the system is inhibited when aircraft are very close to the ground.

Analysis: What do we know about Ronald Reagan National Airport?
08:26
,
Simon Calder
Most international flights to the U.S. capital arrive at Dulles Airport, 20 miles west of the city centre. Other flights from abroad touch down at Baltimore Washington, 30 miles northeast.
Ronald Reagan National Airport is most unusual. It opened in 1941 very close to the centre of Washington - the northern perimeter is just three miles south of the White House. 
Being so close, the airport is popular with many travellers, and management says: "Our Runway 01/19 is the busiest in the country."
In normal operations, the airport handles up to 60 flights per hour. The stipulation is that "mainline" airlines have a maximum of 37 flights; commuter jets, 11; private aircraft 12.
The airport says: "All aircraft movements are solely controlled through the FAA National Airspace System, including the design and implementation of flight procedures and corridors."
As a result of the proximity to the heart of the government, air traffic control is taken extremely seriously. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 - which included a plane being flown into the Pentagon - the airport was closed for 23 days.
The Independent's veteran travel correspondent Simon Calder will continue to provide an analysis of the incident throughout the morning.
