Pentagon Releases Digital Content Refresh Memorandum
In alignment with President Trump's Executive Orders and Secretary Hegseth's directives, this memorandum mandates a digital content refresh across all DoD public platforms. By March 5, 2025, all Components must remove and archive DoD news articles, photos, and videos promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), including content related to critical race theory, gender ideology, and identity-based programs. The Defense Media Activity (DMA) will support systematic content removal from DVIDS and AFPIMS platforms, but Components remain responsible for ensuring compliance across all digital properties. A blanket public acknowledgment of content removal should be posted on social media and other platforms. Exceptions or extension requests must be submitted before noon on March 5, 2025. A link to the memorandum can be found here.
