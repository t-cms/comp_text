Body


Joe Gebbia, the billionaire co-founder of , has reportedly joined 's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Gebbia's appointment adds another high-profile entrepreneur to the team, which has drawn controversy for its aggressive cost-cutting measures.
Joe Gebbia's Ties to Elon Musk
Gebbia has deep ties to Musk's business ventures. In addition to his role on 's board, he has collaborated with Musk on various initiatives and investments, reinforcing their shared vision of efficiency-driven innovation.
Gebbia's entry into DOGE marks a significant shift, bringing his entrepreneurial experience into a government initiative known for its radical approach to cost-cutting. His background in disruptive business models at Airbnb aligns with Musk's vision of streamlining federal operations. While his responsibilities remain undisclosed, reports indicate he will work closely with Musk on budget reduction strategies.
Why It Matters
DOGE, spearheaded by Musk, is tasked with identifying and eliminating what the administration considers excessive federal expenditures. The initiative has already recommended dissolving agencies such as the  and restructuring other departments. Gebbia's entry signals further private-sector influence in shaping federal policy.
According to The Independent, Gebbia arrived at the Office of Personnel Management's headquarters in Washington, D.C., last Friday to begin his role with DOGE. TheNew York Times reported that while his exact responsibilities remain unclear, he will work closely with Musk on budget reduction strategies.
Who Are DOGE's Team Members?
DOGE's  includes a mix of Musk associates, technology executives and policy advisers. Key figures include Christopher Stanley, a former security engineer at  (now X), Brad Smith, an ex-Trump administration official linked to Operation Warp Speed, and Steve Davis, a longtime Musk confidant involved in DOGE's early staffing efforts.
The team also includes a number of  and former  employees, reinforcing Musk's preference for nontraditional government hires.
What To Know
Gebbia serves as a board member at Tesla and has frequently expressed support for Musk's business ventures. His political stance has shifted in recent years; after supporting Democratic candidates, Gebbia announced on X last month that he voted  in the 2024 election.
The DOGE team, created through an executive order signed by President  on January 20, has no formal executive authority but serves as an advisory body to identify cost-cutting measures. Critics argue that its influence extends beyond typical advisory roles due to Musk's close ties with Trump and significant sway over key agencies.
What People Are Saying
DOGE head Elon Musk, Monday on X: "What @DOGE is doing is similar to Clinton/Gore Dem policies of the 1990s. The current Dem party has just gone so crazy far left that it isn't recognizable anymore!"
Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, : "Some cuts may become permanent, but realistically, much of what Trump is implementing can be reversed by the next administration. Unless these changes are codified into law—which requires approval from both the House and Senate—they lack long-term staying power. That said, many  may support Trump's initiatives, as history has shown that opposing the party line can come with political consequences."
What Has DOGE Cut So Far?
Since its formation, DOGE has aggressively targeted government spending that it has deemed unnecessary. It has already proposed eliminating USAID, , and major staff reductions across multiple federal agencies.
The group claims to have cut or redirected more than $49 billion in spending by canceling redundant contracts and programs, including numerous diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
What Happens Next
DOGE has recommended downsizing or eliminating multiple federal agencies, including the  (NOAA). The team has claimed to save an estimated $1 billion daily in government expenditures through canceled contracts and staffing reductions.
With Gebbia joining DOGE, the initiative's next steps will likely involve deeper budgetary reviews and increased private-sector collaboration. However, as legal challenges mount against some of DOGE's proposals, the extent of its impact remains uncertain.
