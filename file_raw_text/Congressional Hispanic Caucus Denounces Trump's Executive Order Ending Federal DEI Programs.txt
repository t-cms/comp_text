The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued the following statement on Jan. 23, 2025:

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) leadership released the following statement in response to President Trump's Executive Order rolling back diversity and inclusion efforts:
"The Congressional Hispanic Caucus strongly condemns President Trump's Executive Order dismantling federal diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and affirmative action in contracting. This harmful action seeks to undo decades of progress toward creating a more equitable and inclusive society.
"Diversity is what makes America, America. Studies consistently show that diverse workplaces drive innovation, efficiency, and prosperity. By targeting these initiatives, this order sends a dangerous message to millions of Americans who rely on these efforts to ensure fair treatment and access to opportunity.
"The CHC remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing DEI initiatives and promoting policies that reflect the strength of our nation's diversity. We reject any efforts to turn back the clock on equity and inclusion, and we will continue advocating for a federal government that uplifts all Americans--regardless of race, gender, or background."
