The BBC's coverage of US President Donald Trump's remarks on the Washington air disaster neatly encapsulated the broadcaster's problem in covering the new US administration. In its news headlines, the president's comments on the potential role DEI (diversity, equality and inclusion) policies played in the crash were described as being made "without giving evidence".
Mr Trump is hardly the first politician to make statements without providing a full and exhaustive explanation for his reasoning, and he will certainly not be the last. Yet he alone appears to have merited this cautious footnoting of his statements, as opposed to simply reporting his words, and those of his critics.
It may be that the BBC now intends to carefully label each and every political utterance in a similar fashion, in which case we can surely look forward to a similar caveating of statements from Hamas, from Rachel Reeves, and from other individuals and organisations across the political spectrum, including those in favour with the staff of Broadcasting House.
At present, however, this approach appears to have been applied to covering Mr Trump, and Mr Trump alone. The effect of this unique coverage is in turn to indicate to the audience that he is uniquely untrustworthy. It is, to say the least, an unusual editorial choice for an impartial news organisation to make. But it is somehow hard to shake the suspicion that this will remain the case for a good deal of time to come.
