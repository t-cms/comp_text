THE British arm of McDonald's is clinging to its corporate diversity policies, breaking with its US parent in apparent defiance of Donald Trump.
The company will push forward with a swathe of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the UK, despite its Chicago-based parent company watering down US DEI policies before Mr Trump took office last month.
McDonald's US business said in January that it would abandon targets to get minorities into senior roles, rename its diversity team its "global inclusion team" and ditch DEI requirements for suppliers in America.
The prospect that its UK business could follow suit triggered calls from the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, which represents employees in the food industry, for McDonald's to "reject attempts to mirror the regressive actions of its US counterpart" in dismantling DEI initiatives.
McDonald's DEI pledges in the UK include ensuring that 40pc of senior leadership roles are held by people from under-represented groups by 2030 and a commitment with its suppliers to advance "social inclusion". McDonald's declined to comment.
