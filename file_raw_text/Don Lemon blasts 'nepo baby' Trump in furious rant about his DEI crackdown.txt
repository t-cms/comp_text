PODCAST: Trump's tariffs, Elon's USAID takeover and how aviation safety hangs in the balance - listen here
                     Don Lemon claimed Donald Trump is a 'nepo baby' as he furiously blasted the president for blaming diversity and inclusion initiatives for the tragic plane crash in Washington DC.
The former CNN star, 58, was interviewed by TMZ at LAX airport in Los Angeles and used the opportunity to unload on the 47th president's initial response to the tragedy that left 67 dead. 
'I think Donald Trump is.... I'm trying not to call him a POS,' Lemon began, seemingly trying to hold harsher words back. 
'By his definition of what DEI is, he is DEI hire. Donald Trump is the most unqualified person to be president of the United States, ever.'
Lemon went on against the president: 'He's a nepo baby, among other things that I could say, but I'd rather not use those words. 
'But he's a terrible person and for him to get up there while there were still bodies in the water was a new low even for him.
'He should be embarrassed and all the MAGA people who voted for him should be embarrassed.'
Lemon also went after 'the four white men [in his cabinet] who stood with Trump' during last week's press briefing on the plane crash, saying they were also 'DEI hires.'
'You think Pete Hegseth is qualified to be the defense secretary? Only in stupid, MAGA-brain world is a Fox News host qualified to be the defense secretary,' Lemon added.
'So for Trump to blame DEI, he should take a look in the mirror and look at his own appointees.'
Lemon concluded by declaring that 'Donald Trump is a racist, and he solidified that to the world standing at that briefing room.' 
'I said it seven years ago, and shocked everybody on CNN, and seven years later I'm proven right,' Lemon said.
Trump sparked criticism last week when he suggested on Thursday that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) were to blame for the plane crash. 
The president asserted his opinion at the White House press briefing even though the crash had yet to be fully investigated and there has been no determination as to whether the FAA did anything wrong.
'The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency's website,' said Trump, noting that the program allowed for the hiring of people with hearing and vision issues as well as paralysis, epilepsy and 'dwarfism.' 
Lemon's fellow liberal Sunny Hostin went on a similar rant last month on The View, also claiming Trump was a 'DEI hire.' 
Reacting to Trump's announcement that he would get rid of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, The View co-host used a pun to say Trump 'Didn't Earn It' - and instead obtained the world's highest office through nepotism.
'Donald Trump saying things that this country would be a meritocracy, you're talking about a man who didn't become the president of the United States because of merit,' Hostin said.
She argued Trump did not earn the presidency because he had 'no political experience' before winning the White House the first time.
'He was given everything that he has,' Sonny continued. 'He is a legacy hire. He is, if anything, a DEI hire, a "didn't earn it" hire, and so, those are just some of the things I was thinking about.'
Hostin then brought up Martin Luther King's legacy and how it differs from Trump's view for the country.
'The one thing I did think about was the hypocrisy of having a man be inaugurated to be president on the same day as we commemorate MLK, and that same man saying that he was going to get rid of diversity, equity and inclusion,' Hostin said.
'Because Martin Luther King not only wanted racial equality, he wanted economic equality. And that is something people tend to miss.'
Hostin added that 'Black Americans deserve reparations for the injustices they face.'
She then repeated MLK's famous quote - 'it's all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps but to say to a bootless man he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.'
