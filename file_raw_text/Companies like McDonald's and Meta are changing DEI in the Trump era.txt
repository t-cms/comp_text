Companies are scrambling to rejigger, recast or just kill their  
Why it matters: Firms are on a tightrope with legal risks on either side - stick with DEI and face a Trump DOJ investigation or lawsuit; or abandon it, and face the potential for lawsuits from employees and job applicants.
Either way companies run the risk of angering customers and staff.
Where it stands: Corporate America's DEI anxiety intensified after February 5, when newly sworn-in attorney general Pam Bondi issued a  
By March 1, the division should report "the most egregious and discriminatory DEI" practitioners, per the memo.
That followed an executive order Trump  
What they're saying: Since the Bondi memo came out, "I have been on the phone with companies almost nonstop," says Jonathan Segal, an employment attorney at Duane Morris.

Even activities meant to celebrate certain groups are getting the heave-ho. One bank pulled back on programming for International Women's Day, the  
The big picture: Anti-DEI sentiment was building, and companies were rolling back polices, before Trump took office.
45 companies have been attacked for their DEI policies over the past three years by opposition groups led by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and activist Edward Blum, according to a tally from  
The trend intensified starting Jan. 20, as Trump issued the first of many executive orders on the topic.
