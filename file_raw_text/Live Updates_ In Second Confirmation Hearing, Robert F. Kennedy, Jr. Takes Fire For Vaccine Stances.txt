Today, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Donald Trump s nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, testified at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.
Yesterday, Kennedy had a confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance committee.
Today s hearing began at 10:00am ET Thursday, and concluded at 1:00pm. Live updates and highlights from the hearing are below.
Senate HELP Committee Hearing, Thurs. Jan. 30
1:09pm. In their closing statements, both Chairman Cassidy and Ranking Member Sanders cited the themes they carried throughout. Sanders stated that he hoped that Kennedy would be an advocate for making healthcare more accessible and more affordable, and that he would also take on the food industry that is  poisoning our kids. 
Cassidy stated that while he sees eye-to-eye with Kennedy when it comes to obesity and processed foods, he is struggling with his anti-vaccine activism in terms of whether he would vote to confirm him.  I have to determine if you can be trusted to support the best public health,  he said. He wondered if Kennedy would actually support the best science, as he testified, or if he would  undermine it by always asking for more evidence and not supporting the best evidence that is there. 
Can a 71 year-old man who s spent decades criticizing vaccines and who's financially vested in finding fault with vaccines   can he change his attitudes and approach now that he will have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?  Cassidy asked.
12:37pm. Senator Collins (R-Maine) asked Kennedy about whether he would support ongoing clinical studies of a Lyme disease vaccine. Kennedy said that members of his family suffer from Lyme disease and that there is  nobody who will fight harder to find a vaccine or treatment for Lyme disease than me. 
12:35pm. Senator Alsobrooks (D-Md.) referenced a conversation she had with Kennedy where she said he wanted to  clean house  at NIH and asked what standard he had for terminating employees. Kennedy said that he would target  corrupt  scientists, citing a recent New York Times article about issues over NIH-funded research of Alzheimer s disease. Alsobrooks asked if he had a list of people targeted for firing and Kennedy said he did not.
12:25pm. Senator Murkowski (R-Alaska) asked about Kennedy s commitment to boost the budget for Indian Health Services. Kennedy replied that he wants to bring in a Native representative at the  Assistant Secretary level  to provide support and input for healthcare in Native American communities to ensure that  decisions are conscious of their impact on the First Nations. 
12:16pm. A question from Senator Moody (R-Fla.) involves a claim that also came up in the Finance Committee hearing yesterday which was whether HHS would commit to helping find the  300,000 missing children  of migrants to the United States that are suspected to have been trafficked. An AP report from last October explored this claim and found this likely has more to do with paperwork snafus than any indication that such a large number of children have gone missing.
12:08pm. Senator Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) asked Kennedy about the Inflation Reduction Act s provision for Medicare to negotiate lower prices for drugs. Kennedy replied that President Trump is  committed to lowering drug prices. 
Hickenlooper also asked about how Kennedy would work to prevent chronic disease. Kennedy replied that Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act programs should continue to move healthcare systems towards value-based care including prevention. He also said that the FDA and CDC should work more to find environmental toxins that harm health and eliminate them.
11:58am. Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.)asked Kennedy if he thought federal law regarding emergency care meant that a pregnant woman could get an abortion in order to save her life. Kennedy replied that he commits to providing that care. (Chairman Cassidy interjected after this exchange that he didn t believe treating a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy counted as an abortion.) Kennedy also said that he didn t believe the Trump administration executive order regarding eliminating DEI programs applied to programs focused on improving health in minority communities.  I believe in helping all people,  he said.
11:48am. Senator Kim (D-N.J.) asked Kennedy about his thoughts on GLP-1 drugs as a treatment for obesity. Kennedy replied that he thinks they re  miracle drugs  but said that they ve become a first line treatment for 6 year-olds with obesity and that he opposes that. (GLP-1 drugs are not approved by the FDA for children younger than 12, though clinical studies of kids 6-11 suggest they are safe for this age group).
During his conversation with Kim, Kennedy also stated he supported medical interventions for opioid addiction. Kennedy also restated his opinion that he believes that radiation from WiFi and cell phone towers can cause cancer. (There is no evidence that wireless technologies can cause cancer.)
11:42am. Senator Tuberville (R-Ala.) lamented the medical treatment of ADHD, saying that in his days  parents used a belt  rather than a pill and what does Kennedy want to do about that. Kennedy again repeated his false claim that  15% of kids are on Adderall.  Only about 11% of U.S. children have been diagnosed with ADHD, and fewer than 60% of those are prescribed medication for it.
11:21am. Senator Murphy (D-Conn.) read passages from one of Kennedy s books in which he compared childhood vaccination campaigns to both the Holocaust and the pedophilia scandals in the Catholic Church.  You re not questioning science,  Murphy said.  You ve made up your mind. 
11:17am. Senator Scott (R-S.C.) asked Kennedy whether he would commit to pro-life policies and hire pro-life personnel. Kennedy replied that he will  implement President Trump s policies.  Kennedy also said that he would commit to maintain a coordinator for response to sickle cell disease and that he was excited to support gene therapies for the disease. Kennedy also stated that HHS under his watch would look to provide incentives for manufacturing of drugs and medical supplies in the United States rather than importing them.
11:10am. Both Senators Paul and Mullin (R-Okla.) spent time defending Kennedy s past questioning of the connection between vaccines and autism, claiming that incidence of autism has been increasing so why shouldn t we look at whether vaccines are involved? This wasn t mentioned in the hearing but the best evidence available suggests that autism is primarily related to a person s genetics rather than external factors. Studies investigating a potential link between autism and vaccines have consistently found no connection.
10:54am. Senator Paul (R-Ky.) didn t ask any questions but did defend Kennedy s historic vaccine skepticism. In particular he questioned why babies should get Hepatitis B vaccines  when you only get it through sex and drug use.  Senator Cassidy retorted for the record that a big reason for this is because Hepatitis B and be transmitted between mother and child and the infection status of the mother isn t always known.
10:46am. Senator Sanders began by following up on Cassidy s question about whether Kennedy would say vaccines don t cause autism. Kennedy said he would follow data and Sanders retorted the data has been there for years. He followed up by asking about wanting to pull the Covid-19 vaccine in 2021. Kennedy replied he only wanted to pull it for 6 year olds who didn t need it. (Covid-19 was a leading cause of death for children in the U.S. during the pandemic years of 2021 and 2022.) Kennedy also would not say whether he thought the Covid vaccines saved lives. (Studies suggest they have saved millions of lives.)
Sanders also asked whether Kennedy would stand up for Medicaid against proposals to cut the program. Kennedy replied that he wasn t aware of any plans to make cuts, to which Sanders reported that he should  read a newspaper. 
10:35am. Cassidy led things off by firing questions at Kennedy - leading off with asking him if he would reassure mothers that measles vaccine and hepatitis B vaccines don t cause autism. Kennedy replied that  if the data is there I will do that.  Cassidy retorted that the data is there and had been there before he entered Congress 16 years ago and asked if Kennedy would state that these claims are false. Kennedy replied that he would review data and if he was wrong would apologize for misleading people.
Cassidy also asked Kennedy about his past claims that Lyme disease was created as a bioweapon. Kennedy replied that he never believed that, but rather that you should follow the evidence and there were some books that had made the claim.
10:25am. Kennedy s opening comments were similar to yesterday s. In his opening statement asserted that he was not anti-vaccine but  pro-safety.  He promised to promote science in the HHS and to end the chronic disease epidemic.
10:22am. Ranking member Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) opened by congratulating Kennedy for the phrase  Make America Healthy Again,  which Sanders said he agree with because  we re the richest country in the history of the world but rank below major countries in terms of life expectancy.  He noted that Kennedy s uncle (John F. Kennedy) and father (Robert Kennedy) both agreed that healthcare is a human right and hoped that Kennedy would do the same. Sanders went on to highlight the high cost of healthcare, saying that when one out of four people can t afford prescription Americans,  how do we make America healthy again? 
10:20am. In his opening statement, HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.) began by praising Kennedy for his work in advocating against processed food and its role in obesity. But he quickly pivoted to expressing concern over Kennedy s history of undermining trust in vaccines. He told a story of an 18 year-old patient he had who required an emergency liver transplant because of a hepatitis B infection, an event he said made him vow to  never speak to a parent about a child dying from a vaccine-preventable disease  and led to his pro-vaccination work. He asked Kennedy for some assurance that his anti-vaccination ideas were behind him and that he would work to restore trust in public health institutions.
Finance Committee Hearing, Weds. Jan. 29
1:33pm. And after a few final quick statements and questions from Senators, where most notably Kennedy said he would prioritize efforts towards combatting avian flu, the Finance Committee hearing has been adjourned. Tomorrow, Kennedy will make his appearance before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee and we ll resume updates then.
1:18pm. Senator Young (R-Ind.) criticized NIH research efforts towards finding treatments for long Covid. He asked Kennedy if he s confirmed, if he would work to accelerate development of treatments for long Covid and prioritize research dollars to developing clinical trials for treatments and diagnostics. Kennedy replied he would do so.
1:08pm. In discussion with Senator Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Kennedy decried the amount of food additives allowed in the United States as being a cause of obesity in the United States. He also said that he wants to work with the USDA to ensure that farmers are incentivized to transition to regenerative agriculture and other techniques to make practices less chemically intensive.
12:42pm. Senator Luján (D-N.M.) asked Kennedy about diversity in clinical trials. Kennedy replied that he would  do everything he can  to make sure Native Americans are included in clinical trials. FDA guidance about inclusion in clinical trials has been removed from the agency s website this week. Luján asked if he would support increasing clinical trial diversity, and Kennedy replied  Yes  and that he would commit to making sure positions in that regard are adequately staffed.
12:34pm. Part of Kennedy s discussion with Senator Blackburn (R-Tenn.) came to dealing with prescribing medication to kids with mental health issues. Kennedy claimed that this was a big issue, that over 15% of children were prescribed adderall and that  even more  are on antidepressants. According to the CDC, fewer than 10% of children are prescribed medications for mental health. Kennedy also claimed that medications are the  third largest cause of death  for children, though according to an NIH study, the three major causes of death for children are car accidents; firearm-related homicides, suicides and accidents; and cancer.
Senator Blackburn also asked Kennedy if he would support removing a policy from Medicaid where it does not pay for care for the Institutions for Mental Diseases, which has been part of Medicaid since the 1960s. Kennedy agreed that this policy should be removed.
12:09pm. Senator Warren (D-Mass.) asked Kennedy if he would agree to not take a job with a pharmaceutical company, hospital or other healthcare company, to which Kennedy agreed.  I don t think they d want to give me money,  he quipped. However, the two had a long back and forth over Kennedy s ties to WisnerBaum, a law firm that is suing vaccine manufacturers. Kennedy earns referral fees for such lawsuits. Warren asked Kennedy if he would commit to not receiving any such fees while HHS Secretary. Kennedy demurred over this, saying that he wouldn t commit to not suing drug companies. At this point the committee chair, Senator Crapo, interjected by saying that Kennedy had met all of the ethical requirements dictated by the Office of Government Ethics. Warren objected that this type of compensation wasn t really contemplated by the rules. At this point the hearing moved on.
11:52am. Senator Barrasso (R-Wyo.) asked Kennedy how he would approach the challenges in ensuring access to rural hospitals. Kennedy acknowledged that such hospitals are closing at an extraordinary rate, which he said can be addressed through technology through the use of technology like  AI and telemedicine.  In that regard he cited a Cleveland Clinic  AI nurse  that  you can t distinguish from a human being.  He also stated that if confirmed he would look into changing rules regarding requirements for registered nurses in nursing homes.
11:17am. Senator Lankford (R-Okla.) asked Kennedy about his approach to abortion and direction of HHS policy under Title X, legislation directing the provision of affordable birth control and reproductive health care. Kennedy replied that he supports the Trump Administration policy towards abortion policy on leaving major decisions to the states and cutting off federal funding for abortion.  I serve at the pleasure of the President,  he said.  I will implement his policies. 
10:59am. Senator Cornryn (R-Texas) praised the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an initiative under President George W. Bush that provides HIV medicines to Africa. Kennedy said that he supports the program and will absolutely keep it going. Neither mentioned the Trump Administration has halted the program, according to reports from NPR and The New York Times.
10:45am. Sparks flew between Senator Wyden and Kennedy over vaccines. Wyden cited a statement Kennedy made on a podcast saying that  no vaccine is safe  and that if he could go back in time, he wouldn t have vaccinated his kids. Kennedy said he d intended to say that  no vaccine is safe and effective for everybody  but that he supports vaccines for measles and polio. Wyden also criticized Kennedy for calling to pull authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines in May 2021. Kennedy states that he was focused only on its authorization for children and that nobody thinks a 6 year old should be vaccinated for Covid. (The CDC, FDA and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend vaccinations for children 6 months and older.)
10:30am. In his opening statement, Kennedy noted the challenges of the American healthcare system in having some of the highest costs among high-income countries while having some of the poorest health outcomes. He stated that in his opinion, determining who pays for care is like  rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic  because the real issue is the high cost of care. He also denied being anti-vaccine and said that he is  pro-safety.  He stated that his primary goal as HHS secretary would be directed towards treatment of chronic disease.
10:20am. Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore) set the likely tone for the hearing. Crapo praised Kennedy s willingness to be open during the nomination process. He also listed out the challenges of the American healthcare system, noting that the federal government provides care for 2 in 5 Americans and faces an aging population. Crapo said that he looks forward to Kennedy providing  bold solutions  to challenges and praised his attention to combatting chronic diseases.
Wyden led off his opening statement by saying that a review of Kennedy s record provides  receipts  that Kennedy has  embraced conspiracy theories  about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Wyden said Kennedy has made it his  life s work  to sow doubt and discourage patients from getting vaccines, citing a situation in Samoa in which Mr. Kennedy s advice about not vaccinating children for measles may have led to over 80 deaths. Wyden also criticized Kennedy s previous call to pause infectious disease research for 8 years. He also criticized Kennedy s lack of experience and claimed that he had a tendency to change his position on multiple issues.  When he s taken every side of every issue,  said Wyden.  How can the American people believe he has anything to say?
