BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: We will have an exclusive interview with the French President on Monday. Also this weekend, please join Shannon Bream on Fox News Sunday. Her guests are Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Jim Jordan and Jim Hines. We'll cover it all. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. Here's Laura.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle. And as always, thank you so much for joining us. Tonight, we told you the Democrats hated you.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The fact that I'm rooting for Canada and I'm rooting for Mexico a lot is really wild,
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Plus, VP Vance hits back hard against the woke culture.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
J.D. VANCE (R), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Don't allow this broken culture to send you a message that you're a bad person because you're a man.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And is Trump about to bomb the cartels?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What can you tell us about the CIA drone flights over Mexico? Is this the next step in the war against the cartel?
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, we're going to see.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: All that and more. But first, how are they doing it? Doing so much, so many executive orders, so much trimming of government fat, so much diplomacy and trade policy so fast. Yes, they have learned some hard lessons from the first go around. And yes, they are more organized this time, but it's a little simpler than that. Trump and his team are changing Washington so profoundly because they outwork the other side, and they never get off the offensive.
Now today, at the Governor's Association meeting, Donald Trump addressed friends and political foes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I let the precedent today because we have nothing to hide, right. It's much better. They said, do you want to let the precedent? I said, why not? You think Biden would do that? I don't think so.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And then came the salvo about his executive order protecting women's sports. Well, of course, some Democrat loons captive to trans mania pledge not to comply like Maine's Janet Mills.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: You understand Maine, is the Maine here, the Governor of Maine?
JANET MILLS, GOVERNOR OF MAINE: Yes, I'm here.
TRUMP: Are you not going to comply with it?
MILLS: I'm complying with state and federal laws.
TRUMP: Well, we are the federal law. Well, you better do it. You better do it, because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't. And by the way, your population, even though it's somewhat liberal, although I did very well there, your population doesn't want men playing in women's sports, so you better comply, because otherwise you're not getting any federal funding.
MILLS: See you in court.
TRUMP: Every state -- good, I'll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a really easy one. And enjoy your life after, Governor, because I don't think you'll be in elected politics.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, now that was the best, Trump reading -- no -- Trump one-on- one with someone, I love it. And by the way, he was at Tiger Woods at the White House announcing plans to honor African Americans, that was yesterday, and because the Left only thinks that they have the final say on history, he said no.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The garden will predominantly feature incredible women like Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin and Coretta Scott King of a statue for men like Frederick Douglass, Booker T Washington, Jackie Robinson, what a great athlete that was, Martin Luther King, Jr, Muhammad Ali and the late Kobe Bryant.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now that's going to be a beautiful tribute to African Americans, a lasting tribute. But look, the Trump administration is just like ripping up the old weeds of the establishment and replanting the place with a tradition and new officials who actually care about the people of America, not the bureaucracies that have robbed Americans for years.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELON MUSK, CEO, X: Well, I think it's really important for people to understand that the Biden administration sent any possible money that they could -- if there was money they could send to facilitate and amplify illegal immigration. They sent it. OK. They took money from FEMA meant for helping Americans in distress and sent that money to luxury hotels for illegal immigrants in New York. That is an outrage.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: FEMA money and one big pot used to house illegals in luxury hotels. Just another outrage. And by the way, the rampant COVID fraud, we knew that was going to happen, billions and billions going out the door. Well, today, we learned that billions and billions in COVID relief funds meant for school were spent on things like $86,000 for hotel rooms at Caesars Palace in Vegas, 60 grand on swimming pool passes. I don't know what that means, and thousands that California, one district there used to purchase an ice cream truck.
And Democrats wonder why Americans just don't trust them. Don't trust them at all on the economy, and that's why DOGE's efforts are still so popular.
Non-stop lawfare. Democrats only hope for slowing the Trump agenda before the midterms, and it's also their only hope of stopping the chainsaw that the DOGE crew is taking to every federal agency. But even with activist judges ready to roll over Trump, Democrats have still had mixed results. There's good news for Trump shrink the government agenda came yesterday when a federal judge refused to halt firings of unnecessary federal employees. Now this is despite, by the way, all the sob stories of the bureaucrats that are circulating online.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've just always thought that hard work pays off, you know, and it just -- it doesn't feel like that right now. Please come and see the work that we do, the people that we help and impact that we make.
ARIELLE PINES, MILITARY SPOUSE WITH 15 YEARS OF SERVICE FIRED FROM VETERAN AFFAIRS: It's been very important to me, and it's something that I've dedicated my entire adult life to, and I'm just devastated by this termination.
ARIELLE KANE, FEDERAL WORKER WHO RECEIVED TERMINATION LETTER: I'm really upset, like this was my dream job. I'm also outraged for my colleagues.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Outraged for my colleagues. Well, I mean, it's never fun. You know, I've been fired. It's not fun. But as Elon Musk said today, it's better for people who are in unnecessary jobs to move into necessary jobs in the private sector. It will be better for everyone, by the way, probably for most of those employees as well. But, by the way, Team Trump hasn't been as fortunate defending his executive order banning birthright citizenship because a federal appeals court refused to reinstate that despite the administration's request. Now that one's headed for the Supreme Court, I've told you that before, and there it may be a rough ride. We're going to see how it all plays out.
But as of today, Trump's agenda, his policies, remain very popular. Remember, voters elected him to beat inflation, to bring down prices, to close the border and restore commonsense pragmatism to U.S. foreign policy. But Congress also needs to step up. Congress also needs to give America lasting relief and change, and this means we have to reverse the usual trend of incumbent presidents and their party losing seats in the midterm, can't do that. Got to grow the movement. Grow President Trump's support. And while he's riding high now, he cannot allow any slippage.
Meanwhile, in Democrat circles.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Democrat Party has in some ways become too much seen by too many Americans as the party of elites and institutions that have failed them. If you were talking about democracy over the dinner table, you probably didn't have to worry about the cost of the food on that table.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Democrat voters are beginning to lose faith, while Congress has an overall 29 percent approval rating. That number drops to 5 percent for Democrats, and it's because Democrats are doing nothing for the American people.
Joining me now, Matt Towery, political analyst and Mark Penn, former Clinton advisor, both are pollsters. Mark, let's start with you. Let's start with the Democrats first. Why are they failing to connect with the American people a month into this administration?
MARK PENN, FORMER BILL CLINTON ADVISOR: Well, I've got some new polling coming out Monday that I just looked at. And frankly, the Democratic Party is falling off a cliff. The ratings, which were in the high 40s, are going to be like 35 percent and I think the basic question who is doing better job as president, Biden or Trump? Trump is winning that with 57 percent.
I think you're seeing a retrospective assessment of Biden and the direction, the Democratic Party was going, it really a lot more negative than it was on Election Day. And they're looking at the contrast on immigration, on economic policy, on some of the social policies, and boy, they're reevaluating and the Democratic Party, I have never seen anything like this. This is a record low for the Democratic Party in terms of favorability. It has fallen really, really way down. And I don't think there's any leadership right now that's going to be able to bring that back.
INGRAHAM: Well, and CNN was all excited, Matt Towery, the other day, because in a few polls, Trump's numbers declined a little bit. Okay, so they were like, Oh well, it's just -- his numbers are falling. They're slipping. What do we know really about the current state of Trump's approval, his approval on the economy and just the direction of these policies?
MATT TOWERY, POLITICAL ANALYST AND POLLSTER: Well, I think, first of all, Mark framed it right. Where is Trump vis-a-vis Biden, and he's way ahead. That's something that gets hidden in these stories. The second thing is, you have a lot of the pollsters who could not poll Trump well during any of his election cycles, coming out suddenly saying what his approval rating is. Whereas you get someone like Harris, which Mark is involved with, or InsiderAdvantage, or Trafalgar or others Atlas, we're more likely to get his approval right. And I think his approval rating is somewhere between six and 10 points above, in other words, a plus 10 or more, whereas these media groups are trying to say he's down three or he's down four, that is just not born out by the facts I've seen or the numbers I've seen, or numbers I've seen from other pollsters who I really respect.
And I think the Trump team knows this is coming. They know there's going to be this big play of saying, oh, he's suddenly becoming unpopular, they're going to try to drive a wedge between him and Elon, it's not working.
INGRAHAM: Mark, Van Jones is trying his best to drive a wedge between Trump and Elon Musk. So this was kind of an interesting moment. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VAN JONES, FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO OBAMA: You unleash somebody who is doing theatrics and abandoning his own children and having some weird fantasy in front of everybody to be popular. Just do whatever he wants to do with no oversight. That is anti-American, and it's reckless and it's wrong.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK, explain that one for me, Mark. The guy is volunteering his services.
PENN: Well, I really don't understand the Democratic strategy, frankly, of going after Musk. There is overwhelming support for cutting government spending, overwhelming, you're talking 70 percent plus numbers saying that waste, fraud and abuse. Now, Musk himself has about an even personal rating, but the mission that he's on is really seen as one that America needs to do.
INGRAHAM: And Matt, do you agree with that, is -- Musk is popular, correct?
TOWERY: Yes. Here's the thing, a lot of the polls have asked the question, do you think Elon Musk should have a great deal of influence in the White House? That's not the question to ask. The question is, do you approve or disapprove of what he's done so far? And when you ask that question, he's up by five or six points. And among Republicans, which, by the way, the media was trying to say, they were all leaving him in the polls as well. He's at almost 79 percent, 80 percent, so Musk is not a problem for Donald Trump right now, and the show they're putting on right now is working.
INGRAHAM: Yes, people are enjoying the ride. It's like Christmas morning every day. I'll say it every day. Matt and Mark, both of you, thanks so much. All right, when we come back, Democrats may lose young men voters for a generation, certainly after what VP Vance just said, my Angle explains it next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Advance with Vance. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Last summer, Dem and media type spent a lot of time trash talking Trump's VP pick.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could Kamala Harris have picked a better contrast to J.D. Vance, who I think in opposite to Walz, to know that guy is to really detest that guy.
KAMALA HARRIS (D), FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: May have the list, Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record and some of what he and his running mate are saying, it's just plain weird.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tim Walz over there, who was the first one to actually call J.D. Vance and Donald Trump weird. And then look at the rest of them. MAGA Make American Great Again. How about the Republican Party? And then there's, of course, J.D. Vance. Of course, people might just be searching for the word weird and associating with Republicans.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: They're in a Vance trance, yes. And now we know why they were so hot last summer to smash him. And it wasn't Vance's childless cat lady comments, which were hilarious, by the way. Instead, it was because they knew how effective he'd be, because, like Trump, the man never stops. He never backs down from a fight. Last week, he laid waste to the euro globalists who think U.S. taxpayers should be there forever bankers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: I've heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from, and of course, that's important, but what has seemed a little bit less clear to me, and certainly, I think to many of the citizens of Europe, is what exactly it is that you're defending yourselves for.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It was a seismic message felt around the world, and a much needed wakeup call for our allies. Now one of the best things about Vance is how he schools these impudent news anchors who usually take the side of foreigners over Americans.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks in our country that happened during the campaign, if you may remember. So, clearly not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted.
MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: No, but there are 30,000 people in the pipeline, Afghan refuge. Do you stand by it?
VANCE: My primary concern as the Vice President, Margaret, is to look after the American people, and now that we know that we --
BRENNAN: So, no.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Masterful on policy. Yes, of course he is, but Vance's cultural message is just as important.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: My message to young men is, I think that our culture sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge. You should -- you should try to cast aside your family. You should try to suppress what makes you a young man in the first place. And I think that my message to young men is, don't allow this broken culture to send you a message that you're a bad person because you're a man, because you like to tell a joke, because you like to have a beer with your friends, or because you're competitive.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Also very important in a vice president, of course is he never forgets who is in the driver's seat.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: He's got the best sense of humor of any American political figure, but I think this is why young men in particular are so -- they're so inspired by President Trump is because he doesn't allow the media to tell him he can't make a joke or he can't have an original thought, President Trump just says what's on his mind. That's a damn good thing, and it's a good example to set for young men in American culture.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And he's right, of course, he's right. Young men love Trump. Men ages 18 to 29 voted for Trump by a 14 point margin. The Washington Post notes that it's the first time a GOP presidential candidate claimed an outright majority of the group since 1988, but why do Republicans in the past struggle with this group? Well, first of all, we all know big media, sometimes at the urging of government officials, always stepped in to help the Democrats.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: The Biden administration did more to destroy free speech, not just in the United States, but also in Europe than any administration in American history.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Again, he's relentless. He's always on the offensive. He's reminding Americans about why cutting wasteful spending is critical for our economic survival.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: The third thing that he's tried to do, of course, with the help of Elon and all the great folks at DOGE is asked, what are we doing with all of the American taxpayers money, and why are we wasting so much of it on garbage that the American people either aren't aware that we're spending it on or don't want to be spending it on.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: 100 percent right. It's very effective. Now, when you watch these clips, you watch the entire speech, which you should, you understand why Trump picked him in the first place, again it's the genius of Donald Trump, and he was excoriated for picking Vance, as you recall. And so far, the MAGA base, they couldn't be happier, and they're so happy that Vance is already shaping up to be the runaway choice of the MAGA supporters to be Trump's successor.
The New York Times today is reporting on the, quote, quieter efforts that are underway to position Vice President Vance as Mr. Trump's eventual successor, and also revealing that Vance is expected to lead some of the legislative battles over Mr. Trump's agenda. The administration's chief lobbyist in the Senate, and he's also assigned to help oversee the potential sale of TikTok.
Well, one thing is clear, they're definitely not treating him like Biden's people treated Kamala in the first few years as an afterthought, she couldn't, she couldn't get arrested, because where is Kamala? His brain power is just beyond dispute. And the caliber of people surrounding Trump in general, it's just super.
But in promoting J.D. Vance and other populace, you know, from the millennial generation, showcasing them being confident enough to do that. President Trump is not making the mistake of Reagan, who, remember, did not leave the party in the greatest of hands. Trump is deciding, at least for now, that he's going to leave this MAGA coalition in great hands, one that's going to be around for decades to come, and that's the Angle.
Coming up, a liberal governor caught covering up rapes at migrant shelters. We'll expose it, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CHRISTINA COLEMAN, FOX NEWS: This is a Fox News update. I'm Christina Coleman in Los Angeles. New York City is suing the Trump administration over revoked grants. The lawsuit is in response to FEMA's decision to take back more than $80 million because of the city's handling of migrants. The money was meant to cover hotel costs for recent arrivals.
Kash Patel swore in today as the new FBI director, calling it, quote, "the greatest honor." Patel, who was confirmed by the Senate, Thursday, has drawn praise from President Trump, but Democrats voiced concerns about the agency's independency.
Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, fires the city's fire chief, Kristen Crowley. Crowley had faced criticism over what some called a slow response to January's devastating wildfires. Last month, Crowley criticized the city for budget cuts that she said made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs. The deadly wildfires killed 29 people and destroyed thousands of buildings. I'm Christina Coleman.
NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: For years the retail giant, Target, like other national chains, has given into woke pressure to sexualize our kids. From children's swimsuits with transgender features such as tuck-friendly construction, and extra crotch coverage, gross, to kids' t-shirts with the message, trans people will always exist. Oh, of course, woke lunch boxes, cups, cups proclaiming gender fluidity. Get the pun. Well, Target, like other stores, learned the hard way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Mega retailer Target has said it will not be putting out pride- related merchandise and marketing in some locations this year after the company faced a backlash and boycott over pride displays in merchandise last year.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: But the people of Florida have not forgotten the state's suing Target over its DEI initiative, saying the company misled investors. Joining us now is the man we started it all, behind the lawsuit, Florida's brand-new Attorney General James Uthmeier. Alright, Mr. Attorney General, explain this to us. First of all, congratulations. Big job here in Florida.
But explain why this lawsuit matters and how you believe that investors were misled here.
JAMES UTHMEIER (R), FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yeah, thanks, Laura, for having me. Companies have some free speech rights, but publicly traded corporations have a duty to their shareholders. And Target's radical sexualization of kids caused a massive backlash, leading to a plummeting stock price. They lost over $10 billion in just 10 days, and that hurts the shareholders. Here in Florida, our pension investment fund suffered a serious loss.
So, we're going to hold them accountable, and we're going to try to tell businesses like Target, let's get back to the business of doing business, stay away from our kids.
INGRAHAM: Well, you know, a lot of parents that I talked to, like a lot of moms' groups, because I have teenage kids and a teenage daughter, mothers are kind of -- they don't know what to do. It's hard to even find a bathing suit and I'm talking for little girls not older teenagers. A bathing suit that doesn't look like it was ripped out of, you know, of porn shoot.
And I guess the libertarian argument here is, we'll just don't shop at that store. And to that you say?
UTHMEIER: Yeah. What I'd say is, I got three little kids too, Laura, and I don't want them growing up in a world where everywhere they walk around someone is trying to sexualize them. Yes, businesses, they can make their own decisions, but if you are a publicly traded company and you have a duty to provide value to your shareholders, you've got to think about what you're doing.
In here, I don't believe they properly educated their shareholders on what was going to happen when the public would have a huge backlash. The public spoke loudly. They were going to answer to them here in Florida and we're going to hold corporations accountable that want to play politics rather than generate profits.
INGRAHAM: Well, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is actually warning Democrats about this topic. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: About diversity, is it caring for people's different experiences and making sure no one's mistreated because of them, which I will always fight for, or is it making people sit through a training that looks like something out of Portlandia, which I have also experienced, and it is how Trump Republicans are made.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Mr. Attorney General, do you think that Democrats are learning anything here? Because from everything I see, they're doubling down on Trans-mania.
UTHMEIER: They do seem to be doubling down. They do not seem to be learning. I will say, I think the business community is. We're seeing more and more corporations try to get DEI out of their DNA, and I think that's a great thing for the American people. I'll say it again. Businesses should just go back to doing what they should be doing, which is making money. Stay out of the politics. And most importantly, stay out of the sexualization of our kids.
INGRAHAM: Yeah, it definitely hits the -- it definitely hits their bottom line. And so, they're doing something adverse to the shareholders interest, and they're supposed to be good fiduciaries of the company. Mr. Attorney General, thank you very much. Come back soon.
UTHMEIER: Thank you for having me. I will.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: If the probability that an illegal is going to vote Democrat at some point, whether it's cheating, but eventually they can become citizens, then the incentive is to maximize the number of illegals in the country. That is why the Biden administration was pushing to get in as many illegals as possible.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: The consequences of Biden importing millions of illegals isn't just political. They're brutally honest consequences that are hurting people all over the country. In Massachusetts, over a thousand serious incidents of drug arrests, domestic violence and rapes have been found in migrant and homeless shelters, like the story of this poor young girl.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: The alleged rape of a 15-year-old disabled girl by 26-year-old migrant Cory Alvarez at the Comfort Inn and Emergency Assistance Shelter in Rockland.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: In Massachusetts, Governor Maura Healey has been in total denial about who's coming in and the security of these shelters.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MAYOR MAURA HEALEY (D-MA): I want to be absolutely clear about who these folks are. They are families. Some expecting moms and children.
I think that we have the right systems in place. Unfortunately, we have security and systems in place. We have vetting in place. It is unfortunate that from time to time, things will happen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining us now is Carine Hajjar, Boston Globe opinion writer and editorial board member. Carine, it's good to see you. What is going on here that the Democrat mayor, these Democrat, the Democrat governor, seem to be on the side of violent criminals who are brutalizing young people, including a lot of these illegal immigrants themselves are being brutalized. How does this make any sense as a political matter, let alone as a policy matter?
CARINE HAJJAR, BOSTON GLOBE OPINION WRITER: I mean, it doesn't make any sense. And the irony here is that the Healey administration ran on promises of the most transparency ever in the governor's mansion. And that is not what we're seeing. We're seeing attempts to hide away what's going on in these shelters, like you said, alleged rapes, a lot of domestic assault. The press, the local press has had to push and push and push to get those reports. And when we get them, they are heavily redacted.
But like you said, the irony here is that these are progressive states and progressive politicians that purport to want to protect migrants. And migrants, including minors, are facing these horrible crimes under state care.
INGRAHAM: Well, it's also been revealed, Carine, that the Massachusetts government, you know, hasn't done real background checks on these homeless shelter residents. So, we don't know who they are. And I said earlier, who's coming into these places. And as a result, you get a lot of former felons, current felons, people who might have ICE detainers already lodged against them.
HAJJAR: That's right. The governor admitted that they weren't doing as rigorous of background checks as we had been to believe. And when you're seeing crimes like these, that's infuriating. And let's talk about taxpayers, too. Taxpayers and community members deserve to know where their money's going, what it's funding, and if their law enforcement is doing their job.
And in these cases, you have all of these shelters that lack the rigorous background checks that are experiencing these alleged crimes. And taxpayers are paying over a billion dollars to fund these. So, really, this has been utter mismanagement and I really hope we get more transparency out of the governor.
INGRAHAM: What I can't believe is that people keep voting for this. I'm a broken record on New England. How do people keep voting for these policies and these leaders? Is there any hope for New England at this point, Carine? I mean, other states around the country have awakened. How about New England? How about Massachusetts?
HAJJAR: Look, there's certainly a lack of accountability that comes when there's utter one-party rule. But the state Republican Party is making modest gains. And you can even look at the last presidential election. Trump didn't win, but President Trump did make modest gains in a state like Massachusetts, and that says a lot.
INGRAHAM: Yeah, and he needs to go to Boston and give another message about the future of the state and the entire New England region. Carine, thank you very much.
HAJJAR: Thank you.
INGRAHAM: And coming up, Meghan Markle rebranding her business, again. And Madonna rampages against the president. Friday Follies with Raymond Arroyo is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's Friday and that means it's time for Friday Follies. And for that we turn to Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor. All right, Raymond. It is just like a dream come true because I understand Madge is back, and the anti-Trump racket is what she's into again.
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, Madonna wrote on X, Laura, I thought this country was built by Europeans escaping living under the rule of a king. Currently, we have a president who calls himself our king. If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Now, Laura, this is from a woman who calls herself Madonna. She's no virgin and no one calls her blessed. And can we run a check to see if this is actually still the artist formerly known as Madonna? What has happened? Is she running a library now?
She posted this -- well, that's not the image. But the image she posted with the X post. She looks like she's a librarian or something, very odd. She went from cabbage patch kid to librarian, but I guess we should just take it.
INGRAHAM: I don't even understand what she's done to herself. I mean, she's an attractive person. I don't agree with anything she says or does, but she was always an attractive person and I don't understand what happened to her. Oh, that's -- she looks good there. She looks very good there.
ARROYO: Well, this is a reaction to a White House tweet, Laura, where they just said Trump was the king of New York for ending congestion pricing, and she's saying he's king of the world. No, he's king of New York like she's the queen of pop. Get over it. Exactly.
INGRAHAM: Oh, my gosh. All right, and Raymond, there's a story that Donald Trump is -- he's decided to switch out the desk in the Oval Office. He's replacing it with the CNO desk. Ah.
ARROYO: Yeah, the Resolute Desk is out. This new one's in. Apparently, it's only temporary while it's being refurbished. But when I saw the story, Laura, I thought, why is he having it revarnished now? And then I remembered this moment from last week.
Remember Elon's son, his little son X, left a bit of remembrance on the Resolute Desk. And knowing the president and the way he loathes terms, he probably said, why don't we remove the excess varnishes and give her a recoat?
INGRAHAM: Let's give it a go.
ARROYO: And the Resolute expect it to come back soon.
INGRAHAM: I love Little X. Little X is the best. But I didn't like little boogies. I didn't like that.
ARROYO: No little boogies and remove all the other crusts that it's gathered over time. Yeah.
INGRAHAM: Well, he does like to do things his own way. He likes his own style and he likes to remake, right, Raymond?
ARROYO: Yeah, well, couldn't they just scrape the thing? They sent the whole thing out for refurbishing. But anyway, speaking of remaking things, Meghan Markle, your old pal, is trying once again, Laura, to relaunch her brand. And she announced the name change in the most authentic, accessible way possible.

UNKNOWN: Last year, I thought, you know what, American Riviera. That sounds like such a great name. It's my neighborhood. It's a nickname for Santa Barbara. I thought about it. And I've been waiting for a moment to share a name that I had secured in 2022. And this is the moment and it's called, As Ever. I've always loved cooking and crafting and gardening. Of course, there will be fruit preserves. I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Because, Laura, when you think of Megan Markle, you think of homemade jam. Yeah, nobody does. Nobody does. But here's the problem with her rebrand. As Ever is already the name of a New York-based clothing line, Laura, in existence since 2015. I mean, it's unbelievable. There's a website.
And her logo isn't even original, Laura. The mayor of a small Spanish town says Markle is infringing on their towns coat of arms which looks like this. Look at this thing. I mean, the Duchess of Sussex can't help creating anything that doesn't Sussex.
Remember, she went from the Sussex brand, which the Royals told her was a no-no, to American Riviera Orchard, to that homey, stolen as ever brand.
INGRAHAM: As if.
ARROYO: And there's only one thing left for her to launch, a Montecito consignment store called Has Bin. I think that would be appropriate.
INGRAHAM: OK, that is really good. Montecito is quite a Tony area, Raymond. I don't know -- maybe if the consignment stores there would be all like Birkin bags and the most expensive things ever. What else do we have?
ARROYO: Her website says she's entertaining, thoughtful, living, and enjoy this new Netflix show she's launching. I mean, the only thing I guess not on -- she says food as well, she's going to cook, the only thing not on the menu is humble pie, apparently. But we'll be watching that exciting special. She should do something on family relations and how to destroy them. That would be more appropriate for Meghan Markle.
INGRAHAM: Raymond, don't you -- speaking of this very self-indulgent, you know, process, she said, aren't you tired of the phrase mindfulness? Like, you see that everywhere. Practice mindfulness. It's like the co-exist bumper stickers, all of that. It's just mindfulness, as ever.
ARROYO: That's for people. That's for those who are out of their mindfulness, Laura. And there are a lot of that going around.
INGRAHAM: Oh, Raymond, what would we do without Meghan Markle on a Friday? That's my question. Raymond, as always, thank you so much.
ARROYO: Have a good weekend.
INGRAHAM: Have a great weekend. As ever, as if. Ahead, is President Trump getting ready to strike at the Mexican cartels? That'd be something. Don't go away.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DOANLD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: What's gone on with Mexico for years now, but now especially it's run by the cartels. They've given us their prisoners. They've given us their drug lords and their gang members.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And a lot of death and destruction. And as he promised, President Trump has designated eight Latin American cartels as terrorist organizations, including the vicious Tren de Aragua and, of course, MS-13 in El Salvador, six groups based in Mexico. Now one of the Mexican cartels that's now considered a terrorist organization is Sinaloa, whose most lucrative business, of course, is the production of fentanyl that has killed hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans.
Joining me now, Jonathan Fahey, former acting ICE director. Jonathan, good to see you tonight. Now Mexico has already come out late today, or yesterday, I guess, and said, uh-uh, we will not tolerate this being used as a pretext for any type of military action by the United States inside our country. Your reaction tonight.
JONATHAN FAHEY, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: Well, I think Mexico really needs to change its tune because they're dealing with Donald Trump now. This isn't the Biden administration. And what he did today was just made it or made it abundantly clear that we are treating this seriously. And it sends a strong message.
And a couple of things, you know, that's going to be done with this. One, people that are helping these cartels in any way can be charged with material support. So criminal charges. This also will cut them down from banking and things like that, because banks can face sanctions and money can be frozen. So those are two ways to get at the cartels with these designations.
But I think Mexico really ought to rethink their position. And I know it's probably a tricky position because drug cartels have so much control there. But they need to really cooperate because Donald Trump is taking this seriously. He's putting the lives of Americans first, our public safety, our national security, ahead of the drug cartels and the Biden-open border and all the stuff that was going on before.
INGRAHAM: So, Jonathan, do you think it's a scale of one to 10, 10 being most likely that the Trump administration could use military drones to take out some of these fentanyl labs in the United States that, without a doubt, their products are killing Americans, and a lot of them.
I mean, I have friends whose children have died from an accidental fentanyl intake thinking it was something else. It sounds like that's where this administration could lean, again, unless we saw something miraculous from Mexico.
FAHEY: Yeah, I think they're going to be going after these labs and things like that because, just remember, during the cocaine deal, you know, when the cocaine was a big problem that it is now, we were going after the cocaine fields and, you know, spraying, you know, things to kill the cocaine, the cocoa. So, of course, we're going to go after these labs and with or without the cooperation of Mexico, because you're right, it's 70,000 people are dying a year from fentanyl, 100,000 a year from drugs overall.
So, this was, you know, for 400,000 people under the Biden administration, so he's going after the labs, he's going after China which is sending the precursor chemicals here, because this has to stop. It has been going on too long with really no resistance from the previous administration. So, Donald Trump is serious. They're going to have to get with the program. They may say a little bit now, but my guess is they're getting with the program.
INGRAHAM: Why wouldn't Mexico declare these cartels terrorists linked at the very least. What are they afraid of?
FAHEY: They're afraid of the cartels because the cartels have so much power and influence in the country. So, they are probably more powerful than the government or at least equally as powerful. So, they're afraid to harm the cartels because the cartels make so much money. They were making so much money under the Biden administration.
And just one quick point with what Donald Trump has done just in the first few weeks, dropping the number of border crossers coming across the border. Those border crossers were paying seven to nine thousand dollars per head to these cartels coming over. So, Donald Trump is taking their money.
So, I think it's a -- you know, the Mexican government is in a tough situation, but I think they better come out on Donald Trump side because he's not yielding on this issue. He's going fight for the American people, fight for the safety, fight for public health, and I don't think this is going to end well for them if they don't want to cooperate.
INGRAHAM: Yeah. Those fentanyl labs, those fentanyl cookers better look up because they might be met with something very unpleasant. Jonathan, as always, thank you so much for joining us.
What a week, another week, another flurry of events in Washington and beyond. And we were there to cover all of it for you. That's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media all weekend long. There'll be a lot posted tonight and tomorrow night. Thank you for watching. Remember, it is America now and forever. And Jesse Watters takes it all from here.
