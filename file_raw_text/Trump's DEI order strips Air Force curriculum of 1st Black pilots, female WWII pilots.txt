Show Caption Hide Caption Tuskegee Airmen: Learn about America's first Black Military pilotsLucasfilm's new #FlyLikeThem initiative is aimed at educating a younger generation about the World War II contributions of the Tuskegee Airmen.USA TODAY Handout The U.S. Air Force will no longer teach its recruits about the Tuskegee Airmen, the more than 15,000 Black pilots, mechanics and cooks in the segregated Army of World War II, an official with the military branch confirmed to Reuters Saturday. Course instruction about the pilots, as well as video of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) ? a paramilitary aviation organization of female pilots employed to fly during World War II ? was also pulled from basic training curriculum, the outlet reported. The Tuskegee Airmen, an active fighter unit from 1940 to 1952, were the first soldiers who flew during World War II. I'll never forget the #TuskegeeAirman and I will continue to tell my family and grandchildren (when I have them) about how they helped during the war. Teaching the USAF personnel about that history is not DEI, not matter how people feel.

The move came during President Donald Trump's first week and on the heels of him ordering the halt of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives programs. The Black aviators included 450 pilots who trained at Moton Field in Alabama and their success led President Harry Truman to sign an Executive Order to desegregate the nation's armed forces in July 1948. USA TODAY has reached out to the Air Force. The Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. fire back over removal of story On Saturday, The Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. released a statement to USA TODAY expressing disappointment and strong opposition to the removal of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen's story from the Air Force's training courses, calling the soldiers "an essential part of American history and carried significant weight" in the war. "We believe the content of these courses does not promote one category of service member orcitizen over another," the statement reads. "They are simply a part of American military history that all service members should be made aware of." "We call upon the President and the Secretary of Defense to immediately rescind this action and provide clearguidance to all government agencies to restore the courses to their former status," the statement continues. "As a nonprofit organization, we are required to remain apolitical. The opinions we express today reflect ourvalues as a military heritage organization, committed to telling a full and accurate history of all service members of World War II, regardless of race, gender or national origin." DEI update: Trump's Education Department dismantles DEI measures, suspends staff Who were the Women Airforce Service Pilots? According to the Air Force Historical Support Division, WASPs flew at 126 bases across the nation, where they also towed targets for gunnery training and worked as instructors for the Eastern Flying Training Command. Among them, 38 died in the line of duty, 11 in training and 27 during missions, according to the division.
