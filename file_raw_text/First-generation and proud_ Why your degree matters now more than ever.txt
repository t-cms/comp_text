In 2025, the rhetoric around immigration has become louder, sharper and, for many, more hostile. 
Immigrant families and their children - many of them first-generation college students - are caught in the crossfire of political propaganda which paints them as outsiders who are undeserving of the opportunities they have worked to secure. 
The journey to earning that degree is fraught with challenges unique to first-gen students, yet it is also filled with the hope and determination that defines immigrant families. 
Completing a degree is more than just an academic accomplishment - it is a testament to the sacrifices made by parents, the resilience of their children and the undeniable fact that immigrants are essential to the fabric of this nation. 
Immigrant families have always been a cornerstone of the American story. They built communities, contributed to the economy and enriched the culture. 
Yet, these contributions are often overshadowed by political narratives that reduce these families to statistics or threats. 
The reality is that immigrant parents make immense sacrifices - working long hours, taking low-wage jobs and often facing discrimination - all to give their children a better future. 
First-gen students carry this weight every day. Their parents' sacrifices are not abstract; these students understand the price their families have paid for their education and they are determined to honor it. 
College campuses - although diverse in many ways - can still feel isolating. Balancing academic demands with cultural responsibilities at home creates a duality that is both empowering and exhausting. Beyond the personal struggles, the rise of anti-immigration rhetoric and attacks on DEI protections for future employers constantly forces them to prove their worth in a society. 
It is what drives them to prove their families are not outsiders, but essential contributors to the American dream. 
Despite this, I've come across some who do not honor those sacrifices, instead playing into harmful stereotypes for social media trends or peer approval. I believe influencers who constantly profit from and the Latino aesthetic cause harm in the community. 
For example, Britney Rodriguez, who is half Mexican, is being "canceled" right now along with her boyfriend, Garik Davtyan, for allegedly supporting President Donald Trump. Their apology video has received backlash because Garik used her identity as a shield from the allegations, as their content involves them being a toxic couple enforcing the toxic Latina stereotype. 
Many other influencers in the community have taken part in the "copy-paste Latina" trend, which promotes a narrow, hyper-glamorous image of Latina women, and reduces cultural diversity to a single aesthetic. 
Seeing this devastates me, especially when I think of the first-gen students who push through overwhelming challenges with resilience. 
As a second-gen college student, I want those who are first-gen to know that we are doing something right when rhetoric is threatened by our ambitions. Your resilience is a testament to the strength of immigrant families and the dreams that fuel them. 
Earning a degree in this climate is not just a personal achievement, it is a form of resistance. Education is a powerful tool for dismantling stereotypes and countering anti-immigrant narratives. A college degree represents hard work, determination and the undeniable contributions of immigrant families to this country. 
It is also a statement of defiance. It says that no matter how loud the rhetoric, no matter how hostile the policies, immigrant families will not be erased. They will thrive. For first-gen students, your degree is more than a credential, it's a legacy - a way to show the world that your family belongs here and that their sacrifices were not in vain. 
The challenges facing immigrant families today are immense. From discriminatory policies to fear-mongering rhetoric, the barriers to success are real. 
So is the potential for change. First-gen students have the power to challenge these narratives simply by succeeding. Your degree is a statement that you are not a threat but a vital part of this country, that your family's story is one of hard work, resilience and hope.  No matter how loud the anti-immigrant rhetoric becomes, it cannot erase the contributions of immigrant families. 
So, to every first-gen student reading this: Keep going.
In a time when so many seek to divide us, your success is a powerful reminder of what unites us: The belief that everyone - regardless of where they come from - deserves the opportunity to succeed.
