The following information was released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):
Over the last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began implementing President Trump's Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing Executive Order and subsequent implementation memos. As a result, EPA has placed 171 employees in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility and Environmental Justice on administrative leave, 11 and 160, respectively.
"Under President Trump, the EPA will be focused on our core mission to protect human health and the environment, while Powering the Great American Comeback. The previous Administration used DEI and Environmental Justice to advance ideological priorities, distributing billions of dollars to organizations in the name of climate equity. This ends now. We will be good stewards of tax dollars and do everything in our power to deliver clean air, land, and water to every American, regardless of race, religion, background, and creed," said Administrator Lee Zeldin.
