Lawmakers decry 's***show' arrangements for indoor inauguration

 that moving Donald Trump's inauguration inside because of the freezing temperatures in Washington, D.C. could result in some members of Congress not being able to attend in person.
The outlet reports, citing four lawmakers and aides, that the possibility that not all lawmakers might get seats in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol for the ceremony and inaugural address is causing disquiet in Congress.
"Simply put, there's not enough room," one senior Republican aide said. "It's a shitshow."
The initial guidance was that anyone with tickets for the Presidential Platform, traditionally erected on the steps of the Capitol, and any members of Congress could attend in person.
Now, on the eve of the inauguration, it appears to be questionable whether that is possible, and there are rumors that some lawmakers might have to watch from elsewhere in the building.
One Republican member said "no one knows" the situation, while another expressed concerns that there would not be enough chairs to accommodate every member.
This is the first time since 1985 that an inauguration has been held in the Rotunda's approximately 7,200 square feet, and in addition to members of Congress, hundreds of dignitaries will be present.
Another Republican who spoke to Politico said members were told they would be in the Rotunda while their spouses would likely be in Statuary Hall or the Capitol Visitor Center.
However, another member said that, as of Sunday, they believed they still had two tickets.
At least 20 Democrats have said they will not be attending.
