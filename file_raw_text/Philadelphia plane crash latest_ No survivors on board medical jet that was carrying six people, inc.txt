A mid-size air ambulance plane carrying a sick child and five others crashed on Friday night shortly after taking off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, plowing into a residential area and setting off at least six house fires.
The crash occurred in the Northeast part of the city around 6:10 p.m, a city statement read. A medical transportation jet carrying a mother, daughter and four crew members were killed. 
The Learjet 55 aircraft was operated by Mexico-based air ambulance company Jet Rescue Air Ambulance. 
The Mexican government said all those on the plane were Mexican nationals. Nine people on the ground were hurt, six treated and released while three remain in the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. 
The child was a girl on her way home with a final destination of Tijuana, Jet Rescue Air Ambulance told CNN.
Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro told a press conference at the crash scene that "we know there will be loss in this region".
President Donald Trump wrote on social media that it was "so sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost."

The patient and her mother were on board along with four crew members. Mr Gold said this was a seasoned crew and everyone involved in these flights goes through rigorous training.
"When an incident like this happens, it's shocking and surprising," Mr Gold told The Associated Press. "All of the aircraft are maintained, not a penny is spared because we know our mission is so critical."

Have there been other fatal crashes with air ambulances?

There were 87 accidents involving air ambulances in the US from 2000 to 2020, resulting in 230 deaths, according to a study in the journal Prehospital and Disaster Medicine. 
Nearly three quarters of those accidents were on helicopters.
Human factors that can include pilot error or disorientation, impairment and fatigue contributed to 87 per cent of the fatal crashes.
The Philadelphia crash was the second fatal incident in 15 months for Jet Rescue. In 2023, five crew members were killed when their plane overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed into a hillside.

The region was experiencing low clouds, light rain and fog. 
"Unlike the midair collision in Washington, D.C., Wednesday night where adverse weather conditions were not present, inclement weather will likely be a key factor in the investigation into this small plane crash in Philadelphia," AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said in a statement. 
"Light rain and fog were reported in northeast Philadelphia at the time of the crash. Visibility at the surface was 5-7 miles. The base layer of clouds was 400-600 feet above the ground. Winds from the southwest at 10 mph were reported in the area at the time of the crash."
"Weather conditions are a critical factor that investigators review after plane crashes. Of course, it is unclear if Friday night's rainy and foggy weather was a direct factor in this plane crash," Porter added. 
Who rides air ambulances?

People with traumatic injuries, pregnancy complications, heart attacks, strokes and respiratory diseases are the most common users of air ambulances, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. 
More than 550,000 patients in the US use them every year.
In Hawaii, for example, they are frequently used to take patients from less populated islands, where health care is more limited, to Honolulu, where the state's biggest hospitals are located.

The owner of the plane that crashed in Philadelphia, Jet Rescue, flew baseball Hall of Famer David Ortiz to Boston after he was shot in the Dominican Republican in 2019.
Air ambulances will often have similar life-saving equipment like ventilators and blood transfusion devices. They will have stretchers and incubators.
The Mayo Clinic, for example, said its air ambulances will have an external defibrillator, an external pacemaker and more than 60 medications.
Paramedics and emergency medical technicians care for patients on board. Sometimes doctors and nurses are on board.  
What is an air ambulance?
05:20
,
Namita Singh
An air ambulance provides transportation to people in critical or life-threatening situations when a ground ambulance can't reach a patient or wouldn't get to them fast enough.
They help boost a patient's odds of surviving and recovering, particularly in rural areas that don't have trauma or burn centers, according to a 2017 US Government Accountability Office report.
They've grown in importance as more rural hospitals have closed, according to a medical journal report from 2022.

Air ambulances can be either a helicopter or a fixed wing aircraft. Helicopters are generally used to take patients between hospitals or from the scene of an accident to a hospital. The airplane versions fly longer distances between airports.
Helicopters make up 74 per cent of all air ambulances, according to the GAO report.
The Philadelphia crash involved a Learjet 55, a small business jet.

A continuous stream of police vehicles and fire trucks initially responded at the crash site, taking over business parking lots.
Within about an hour, the cry of sirens and shouted orders had faded into relative quiet at the edges of the closed-off area, and darkness settled in as drivers passing by peered out trying to see what was happening.

The plane crashed in a busy intersection near Roosevelt Mall, an outdoor shopping center in the densely populated neighborhood of Rhawnhurst.
One cellphone video taken by a witness moments after the crash showed a chaotic scene with debris scattered across the intersection. A wall of orange glowed just beyond as a plume of black smoke rose into the sky and sirens blared.

Michael Schiavone, 37, was sitting at his home in Mayfair, a nearby neighborhood, when he heard a loud bang and his house shook. He said it felt like a mini earthquake and when he checked his home security camera, it looked like a missile came down.
"There was a large explosion, so I thought we were under attack for a second," he said.
Jet Rescue, which provides global air ambulance services, flew baseball Hall of Famer David Ortiz to Boston after he was shot in the Dominican Republic in 2019 and was involved in transporting patients critically ill with Covid-19.
The FAA said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation. The NTSB said an investigator arrived and more officials would be there Saturday.
