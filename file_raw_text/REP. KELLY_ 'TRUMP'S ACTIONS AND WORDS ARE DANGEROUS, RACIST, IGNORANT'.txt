The following information was released by the office of Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly:
Congresswoman Robin Kelly (IL-02) released the following statement after President Donald Trump baselessly blamed DEI efforts for the plane crash in D.C:
"President Trump twisted a terrible tragedy while families are mourning their loved ones to insert his own political agenda and sow division. This is not leadership. We need to investigate how this plane crash happened to give a sense of closure to grieving families and prevent future crashes. Trump would rather point fingers than look in the mirror and face the fact that he just cut a committee responsible for aviation security. The issue with our country is not its diversity. It's the lack of leadership in the White House and unqualified Cabinet. Trump's actions and words are dangerous, racist, and ignorant simply un-American."
