Duckworth Speaks at Asian American Coalition of Chicago's Lunar New Year Celebration
February 23, 2025
[ROSEMONT, IL] - Yesterday, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) delivered remarks at the Asian American Coalition of Chicago's 42 nd Annual Lunar New Year Celebration, hosted by the Indonesian American Community, in Rosemont. Duckworth highlighted the historic contributions of the Asian American community, her Asian heritage and the importance of celebrating diversity despite President Trump's recent attacks on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).
"Every Lunar New Year is an opportunity to honor the trailblazers who came before us, uplift the stories of our traditions and celebrate our community as we continue to forge a path toward a better tomorrow for our children," Duckworth said. "As Trump continues to use diversity as a derogatory soundbite, I was proud to join the incredible leaders of the Asian American Coalition of Chicago to celebrate our heritage and welcome the Year of the Snake this evening. From our struggles to our triumphs--AANHPI stories are the American story and our diversity has always made our nation stronger."
