Trump's executive orders create uncertainty for international students
Elisa Broche, Horshoe Executive Editor
February 11, 2025
Pres. Donald Trump's return to the White House on Jan. 20, 2025, has sparked fear and uncertainty across U.S. college campuses. Within his first week back in office, Trump issued over two dozen executive orders, many of which carry significant implications for international students and higher education institutions. From expanded travel bans to enhanced visa restrictions, these sweeping policies are reshaping the higher education landscape and raising concerns about their long-term effects.
One of the executive orders signed was the directive to implement "extreme vetting" for all foreign nationals applying for U.S. visas, including F-1 and J-1 students. The new policy, titled "Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats," requires federal agencies to evaluate visa applicants for "hostile attitudes" toward U.S. institutions and values. According to National Association of International Educators Deputy Executive Director Jill Allen Murray, this order opens the door for increased scrutiny, potentially targeting students participating in campus protests or engaging in politically sensitive activities.
Adding to the uncertainty, the Department of Homeland Security has rescinded the "sensitive locations" policy, which previously protected schools, universities and churches from immigration enforcement actions. This change allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to operate freely on college campuses, sparking anxiety among students, faculty and administrators. Universities are now scrambling to implement contingency plans, with some urging international students to return to the U.S. early to avoid potential travel disruptions or enforcement actions.
The administration intends to reinstate and expand a travel ban from his first term which would further complications for international students. The potential revised policy would also target additional countries, including China and India, which together account for the largest share of international students in the U.S.. Cornell University's Office of Global Learning issued a warning last month, advising students traveling abroad to return to campus before the spring semester to avoid being stranded by a potential ban. The University of Southern California echoed similar concerns, recommending that students minimize travel and prepare for possible delays in visa processing.
Trump's approach to immigration has also rekindled debates over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Although the administration has not yet taken direct action on DACA, Trump has indicated plans to tighten restrictions, citing concerns over "radical anti-American" sentiment among immigrant communities. Meanwhile, a recent federal court ruling declared Biden-era DACA protections unlawful, further jeopardizing the program's future and leaving undocumented students in limbo.
The impact of Trump's executive orders extends beyond immigration. The order "Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity" bans diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts across federal agencies and contracts. Institutions that rely on federal funding may feel compelled to scale back DEI initiatives, threatening progress in fostering inclusive campus environments.
In contrast, Trump has also proposed granting green cards to international students who graduate from U.S. universities, provided they meet stringent ideological and skill-based criteria. While the proposal seems like a step forward, its limitations exclude a majority of international students, particularly those from underprivileged backgrounds or fields outside of science and technology.
The return of the Trump administration has left international students and universities navigating a complex and evolving policy landscape. Institutions are working to reassure students, with universities like New York University emphasizing their commitment to supporting cross-border mobility. However, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's immigration policies underscores the importance of vigilance and advocacy in protecting the rights of international students.
As the administration continues to shape its immigration agenda, the future for international students remains unclear. For now, they must navigate an increasingly uncertain environment, balancing their academic aspirations with the realities of an administration intent on prioritizing "America First" policies.
