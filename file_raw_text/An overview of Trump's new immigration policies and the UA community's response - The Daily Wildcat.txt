An overview of Trump's new immigration policies and the UA community's response

Colleges nationwide are responding to President Donald Trump's new executive orders when he took office. President Donald Trump's inauguration was extremely active and fast-paced. On his first day, he signed 26 executive orders, five of which were directed toward immigrants. 
The implications that mass deportation has on a university in a border town are major and directly impact many students and staff alike. The changes in Trump's immigration plan are both immediate and long-term. Here is a breakdown of each of these orders. 
Protecting the meaning and value of citizenship 
This order questions the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, limiting birthright citizenship only to the children of green card holders and United States citizens. Beginning Feb. 19, any child of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. will not be granted citizenship and will be considered illegal, including parents who hold temporary status. A federal judge has blocked the order indefinitely.
Guaranteeing the States' protection against invasion 
This order declares invasion at the southern border. It gives the Department of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State the authority to prohibit the entry of anyone at the southern border until it is determined that the invasion is over. 
Declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States 
Just like the title, this order is declaring a national emergency at the southern border, which gives President Trump additional powers and use of things such as military, economic controls and other federal resources.
Securing our borders
In collaboration with the declaration of a national emergency, Securing Our Borders directs the use of military personnel at the southern border to deter and prevent unauthorized entry to the U.S. This also includes implementing physical barriers such as a wall and the use of drones. The order allows the secretary of defense to send as many personnel to the border as wished. 
This order also ends CPB One, a mobile application that allows asylum seekers to pre-schedule appointments and meet with U.S. customs to receive the proper essentials for travel to the country. This application is now disabled and no longer available for use.  
In addition, it ends humanitarian parole for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. This program granted any migrants from those countries with a U.S. sponsor and a passed background check to come and work for 2 years in the country. This also implies to the people already on humanitarian parole, eliminating their legal status. 
Protecting the American people against invasion 
This executive order allows for expedited removal. Expedited removal means that anyone who can't prove that they are in the U.S. legally or have been in the country for more than 2 years can be detained and deported without notice, a hearing in front of a judge or any proper due process. This order also means that any sanctuary jurisdictions that interfere with immigration investigations can and will have their access to federal funding revoked. 
Previously Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not allowed to raid or operate on university campuses. After Trump rescinded the Biden administration guidance that barred ICE from conducting arrests or raids in or around protected areas such as churches, schools, shelters and hospitals, college campuses are now subjected to ICE raids and operations. 
This makes the UA a non-sanctuary for undocumented immigrants or those who have had their legal status revoked due to the new executive orders made. Tucson is home to hundreds of thousands of immigrants coming in from the southern border. Many immigrants and children of immigrants also attend UA, as well as professors and staff. 
The Associated Students of the University of Arizona released a statement on their Instagram in late January addressing the most recent executive orders. 
"We recognize that the recent executive orders and presidential actions have brought about uncertainty, fear and concern for many in our community," the statement read. "As a proud Hispanic-Serving Institution near the border, we understand that these decisions may have a direct and personal impact on you. We see you, we hear you and are committed to standing by you." 
Likewise, several ASUA senators also released a statement in late January providing information about rights for students and directing students to UA's Immigrant Student Resource Center. 
"As proud stewards of our community, we the undersigned are committed to ensuring the safety of all Wildcats. We are here for you, and we will continue to work in your best interest," the ASUA statement read. 
Other groups and organizations on campus have also made a point to speak out on the new immigration policies. MECHA de UA, a student advocacy group, commented on how they believe the new executive orders affect students on campus
"Everyone on the U of A campus is there to seek an opportunity and to not have an opportunity, even if they are undocumented, is just inhumane," a student representative from MECHA said."We are going to be educating our Latino community, even if it's documented or not, everybody needs to know their rights."
MECHA has started holding meetings to discuss immigrant's rights and civil rights and offering other resources for undocumented immigrants and Latino communities on campus. 
Many individual students have also begun to express their feelings and opinions about the new immigration policies being implemented, and how it affects their lives. 
Luis Hernandez, a freshman student at UA, talked about how the university should be addressing the new policies. 
"When safety and regulations have been stripped, and there's been very little to no communications or even assessment of what's going on, that's not a clear reflection of what's going on in the country. And as students, we should have the power to be fully aware of our rights," Hernandez said. 
The recent executive orders have sparked discussion among students on campus. As policies develop, many on campus are working to provide clarity and support to those being affected.
