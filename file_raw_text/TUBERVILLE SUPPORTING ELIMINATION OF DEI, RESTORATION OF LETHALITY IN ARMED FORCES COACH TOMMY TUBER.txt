"For the past four years, I have sounded the alarm about Joe Biden and the far-left, progressive Democrats politicizing our military,"said Senator Tuberville."As a result, recruitment has fallen to the lowest levels since before World War II. We need our military to be a fighting machine, not a playground for Democrats' culture war. Thankfully, change is here.Yesterday's executive orders from President Donald Trump eliminate DEI in the military, reinstate servicemembers discharged for refusing the COVID vaccine, and ensure military standardsare updated to prioritize readiness, restore lethality, and build confidence in our Armed Forces. With President Trump and Secretary Hegseth at the helm, our military will be 100% focused on protecting our country and putting America First on the world stage."
