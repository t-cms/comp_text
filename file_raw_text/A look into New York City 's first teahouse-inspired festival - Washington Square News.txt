A look into New York City's first teahouse-inspired festival
CHA CHA Festival, which runs every weekend of February, boasts five teahouse installations centered around Asian tea culture.

Henry Bayha
Upon stepping into CHA CHA Festival, the city's first teahouse-inspired experience, I was struck by its rich representation of different Southeast Asian cultures. From Filipino desserts to Vietnamese tea, the event - put on by Water Street Projects and running every weekend of February from 12-7 p.m. - showcased an incredible variety of food and beverages. 
FIGWASPE
If you love a fusion of visual masterpieces and culinary genius, FIGWASPE is the place for you. Hanna Hurr, the creator of this installation, wanted to bridge the gap between visual arts and the culinary world, bringing an interactive and immersive element to traditional dishes. Hurr's display at the festival was a replica of a Taiwanese farm and Zen garden, with edible creations - including eggs, brownies and chocolates - hidden within the display. 
Anna Ye Tea
From oolong to matcha, the festival offered every kind of tea imaginable, but what stood out was their selection of Vietnamese tea. That's exactly what Anna Ye Tea aims to change. Founded by Anna Ye, the company's mission is to bring Vietnamese tea into the spotlight and educate people on what makes it so unique and special. Anna Ye Tea has also expanded to a more holistic approach, sharing the stories of minority groups who produce the tea and highlighting Vietnamese craftsmanship, including handmade ceramic teapots and teacups.
kiino brooklyn
Over the past few years, food trends have shifted to accommodate allergies and dietary restrictions, which can often manifest into desserts that lack flavor. That's where kiino comes in - its goal is to create delicious, allergy-friendly treats that anyone can enjoy, without sacrificing flavor or texture. Along with their hot spiced tea, kiino is known for its gluten-free onigiri in flavors like sumac, yuzu konsho menma and mala mushroom. 
One Love Community Fridge
If DIY is more your thing, One Love Community Fridge is a stall you can't miss. The vendor gives customers the opportunity to mix and create your own custom tea bag using a variety of loose tea leaves, so you can take home a blend that's uniquely yours. Even better, all proceeds go toward fighting hunger and food insecurity - every sip supports a great cause.
Fern & Aurora
And finally, a must-visit before heading out: Fern & Aurora. This bakery specializes in Filipino desserts fused with modern French and American techniques, creating innovative and creative baked goods. Their most popular treats include ube doughnuts and burnt basque cheesecake - and trust me, you'll want to save room for both. On the lighter side, the ube doughnuts are airy pastries filled with an ube compote that perfectly balances the sweetness of the doughnut. For a more filling dessert, the burnt basque cheesecake takes on the classic form of a New York-style slice with a thinly burnt surface yet richly gooey filling. 
After making your way through the festival's many booths, you can relax in the traditional tea lounge, where bamboo mats invite you to sit back, sip and soak in the experience. Before leaving, be sure to check out the live tea-making demonstration, where instructors showcase traditional Japanese tea preparation techniques.
