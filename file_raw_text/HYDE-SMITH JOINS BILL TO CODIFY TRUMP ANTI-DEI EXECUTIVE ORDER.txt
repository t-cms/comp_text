HYDE-SMITH JOINS BILL TO CODIFY TRUMP ANTI-DEI EXECUTIVE ORDER
Legislation Builds on Trump's Efforts to Eliminate DEI Programs from Federal Agencies
WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today announced that she is an original cosponsor of Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt's legislation to codify President Trump's executive order to eliminate the illegal and immoral discrimination initiatives the Biden administration forced upon federal agencies under the guise of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI).
Hyde-Smith is an original cosponsor of the Dismantle DEI Act of 2025 (S.382) that, in addition to halting the Biden DEI initiatives, would ensure that future administrations cannot reinstate similar policies. On the first day of his second term, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151 to terminate DEI programs across federal agencies and to compile a list of contractors and grantees associated with these initiatives.
"In America, opportunity and success should be determined by ability, not identity. These DEI programs are inherently biased, waste Americans' hard-earned taxpayer dollars, and prioritize ideological conformity over merit. I am proud to stand with Senator Schmitt and President Trump in ending this divisive and wasteful agenda," Senator Hyde-Smith said.
"DEI has plagued our federal government, academic institutions, and other aspects of our society for far too long, all while disregarding merit in the process. America is the greatest meritocracy the world has ever seen, and no taxpayer dollars should be wasted on funding this divisive ideology which undercuts the values our country was founded on," Senator Schmitt said. "President Trump understands that these programs have absolutely no business in the federal government, and I am proud to introduce this critical legislation with Congressman Cloud that will save taxpayer dollars and put a stop to this DEI madness."
S.382 would build on President Trump's Executive Order by:
* Ensuring all DEI offices are abolished and blocking attempts to rebrand them under different names;
* Banning federal funds from being used for DEI training, grants, or programs, including identity-based quotas and critical race theory; and,
* Empowering individuals with the legal right to challenge any violations in court.
S.382 has been referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. In all, 19 Republican Senators signed as original cosponsor of the Schmitt bill. U.S. Congressman Michael Cloud (R-Texas) introduced a companion bill ( HR.925 ) in the House of Representatives, with U.S. Congressman Michael Guest (R-Miss.) among the original cosponsors.
