The most notorious Jan 6 rioters pardoned by Trump

Joe Sommerlad
After being confirmed as the Republican Party's presidential nominee in March 2024, Donald Trump made a promise.
"My first acts as your next president will be to Close the Border, DRILL, BABY, DRILL, and Free January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned," he wrote at the time on his Truth Social platform.
On his first day back in office on Monday, Trump stayed true to his word on the rioters and granted clemency to more than 1,500 supporters charged with crimes connected to the January 6 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
While an overwhelming majority of defendants were issued full pardons, five members of the far-right Proud Boys and nine members of the Oath Keepers militia had their sentences commuted. 
Trump has also issued full pardons for two Proud Boys members.
Here's James Liddell on the highest-profile Proud Boys and Oath Keeper members - and the most memorable insurgents - who received clemency from Trump, and a reminder of the crimes they committed.

The Senate Armed Services Committee's ranking Democrat Jack Reed has issued the following statement on the latest affidavit regarding Trump's nominee for defense secretary:
"As I have said for months, the reports of Mr Hegseth's history of alleged sexual assault, alcohol abuse, and public misconduct necessitate an exhaustive background investigation. I have been concerned that the background check process has been inadequate, and this affidavit confirms that fact.
"My number one priority is the safety and security of our nation. This has and must always include serious oversight of the US military and its leaders.
"The sworn affidavit from this courageous woman, provided at enormous personal risk and with nothing to gain, documents a disturbing pattern of abuse and misconduct by Mr Hegseth.
"This behavior would disqualify any servicemember from holding any leadership position in the military, much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense."

The now-former leader of the extremist gang who was just granted clemency by Trump, celebrated his release from prison on Tuesday by calling into conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's show and calling for retribution.
Speaking to Jones, a Proud Boys sympathizer who was a key figure in planning the January 6 rally, Tarrio heaped praise on Trump for freeing him and other Proud Boy members from jail. 
He also expressed no regrets about the Capitol riots, even though he previously apologized for his role in the events.
"I'd like to thank again President Donald J Trump for helping us through these difficult times and releasing me, Joe Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl, and Dominic Pezzola. Right? And all the J6ers," he declared.
"We went through hell, and I'm gonna tell you, it was worth it, because what we stood for and what those guys stood for was what we've been fighting for and what we saw yesterday on the inauguration stage.
"I can't tell you it's been easy, but I will tell you it's been worth it."

Trump gives the OK for ICE agents to raid churches and schools looking for undocumented migrants
16:20
,
Joe Sommerlad
Donald Trump's administration has rescinded long-standing policy that prohibits federal immigration authorities from enforcement actions in places like schools, daycare centers, hospitals, churches and other so-called "sensitive areas" as the president lays the groundwork for his "mass deportation" agenda.
"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest," a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. 
"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense."
For more than a decade, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents had been restricted from arrests in "sensitive" sites without approval from more senior officials.
The latest directive under Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman rescinds previous guidance under Joe Biden's administration, which further established "protected areas," including places where "children gather, disaster or emergency relief sites, and social services establishments."
The changes have drawn sharp rebukes and warnings from faith leaders, teachers unions, school districts and immigrant advocacy groups, with state and local leaders in so-called "sanctuary" policies pledging to defend their jurisdictions in court.
And speaking of ICE...

'F*** it, release 'em all': Inside Trump's decision to issue blanket Jan 6 pardons

Joe Sommerlad
In one of the first acts of his second administration, the new president pardoned nearly all of the 1,500 people charged over their roles in the attempted insurrection at the US Capitol four years ago.
Now, fresh details are emerging that reveal the spur-of-the-moment nature of the decision that led to the move.
"Trump just said: 'F*** it: Release 'em all,'" an adviser familiar with the discussions told the Axios.
Meanwhile, it's worth noting that the aforementioned Speaker Johnson has been making it abundantly clear just now that this is the president's call and, ideally, not something he wants to be associated with:

The president has been advancing his "culture wars" agenda by ordering that all federal employees hired under diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs be put on paid leave with a view to their ultimate dismissal.
It is not yet known precisely how many people the order applies to but agencies have been told to put relevant on leave "immediately," according to an executive order signed by Trump on Tueday night.

Musk has denied that his gesture really was a Nazi salute and some debate over the matter erupted on Capitol Hill yesterday at the confirmation hearing for Trump's choice to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, Elise Stefanik, who hotly denied that it was and fell out with Democratic Senator Chris Murphy on the subject.
For what it's worth, this is what far-right agitator Nick Fuentes had to say about it:

Since we're on the subject, here are a few more of his answers for the press yesterday, which saw him reveal that he removed the security detail for his former national security adviser John Bolton (despite credible threats against his life from Iran) because he is, in Trump's opinion, "a very dumb person".

TRUMP: Because I think that was enough time. I thought he was a very dumb person but I used him well.

Fox News was the top destination for those who wanted to see  , according to Nielsen's early data ratings, which were released Tuesday afternoon. On the flip side, though, the early ratings show that Trump's ceremony pulled in nearly 14 million fewer viewers than Joe Biden's ceremony back in 2021.
Between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET, which encompassed Trump's swearing-in ceremony and first address as president, Fox News drew 10.3 million total viewers, and 2 million in the coveted advertising demographic of adults aged 25-54. The total, if it stands, would be the second-highest-rated inauguration in the channel's history.
CNN pulled in just 1.7 million viewers overall, and a demo audience of 534,000, which is the second-lowest inauguration in the network's history if the numbers hold up. MSNBC, meanwhile, delivered its lowest-rated inauguration day, averaging just 848,000 total viewers and 104,000 in the key demographic group.
Among the broadcast networks, ABC led in total viewers with 4.7 million, while NBC pulled ahead in the demographic with 1.2 million. On Monday, 26.3 million viewers watched Trump take the oath of office across seven different networks, including Fox Business Network. Roughly 5.9 million tuned in from the key demographic group.
