The following information was released by Progressive Democrats of America (PDA):
Join our Super Sunday Town Hall with Nina Turner at 4pm et/1pm pt. Trump's Racist Backlash Requires a Stronger-than-ever Pushback. Time for Solidarity and Strategy. RSVP Now!
The PDA Town Hall GOAT (greatest of all time) Senator Nina Turner will let us know about the call to boycott Target, due to its acquiescence to the MAGA movement, by dropping its DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) standards. The boycott is led by Sen. Turner's We Are Somebody organization.
More broadly, Sen. Turner will discuss the necessity of building a powerful movement, four and a half years after the summer of George Floyd, that can overwhelm and triumph over the reactionary racist backlash being led by the Trump Administration.
We'll also learn more about Sen. Turner's exciting new project with Dr. Cornel West, Truth Time.
Also, courtesy of our friends at YPDA (Young Progressive Democrats of America), we'll learn about what's been called a Progressive Survival Guide to Super Bowl Sunday.
Join us this Super Sunday at 4pm et/1pm pt. RSVP Now!
In solidarity,
Alan Minsky for the PDA National Team
