Speaking on Fox News Friday morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he believed there was a staffing shortage among air traffic controllers at the time of the collision, but the investigation will reveal more.
He then echoed Trump's finger-pointing at the FAA's DEI policies.
"The environment around which we choose pilots and air traffic controllers, as the president pointed out correctly yesterday, better be the highest possible standard. The best of the best," he said. 
"I don't care what background they come from, what their race is, what their gender is, if they're rich or they're poor. I just need them to be good at their job because I need my flight to land safely," Hegseth continued. 
According to data reviewed by Axios, most air traffic controllers and airfield operations specialists were white men.

Both black boxes from the American Airlines plane have been recovered - but what are they?
15:30
,
Tim Hepher
The name is a misnomer; they are not actually black but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the quest for answers when planes crash.
Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. Earliest devices recorded limited data on wire or foil. Later devices switched to magnetic tape. Modern ones use computer chips inside hard casings.
There are two recorders: a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) for pilot voices or cockpit sounds, and a separate Flight Data Recorder (FDR). Some devices combine both functions.
They are mandatory on civil flights and the aim is to preserve clues from cockpit sounds and data to help prevent future accidents, but not to determine wrongdoing or liability.
In broad terms, investigators say the FDR helps them analyze what happened and the CVR can - though not always - start to explain why. But experts caution that no two probes are the same and virtually all accidents involve multiple factors.
The disappearance in 2014 of Malaysian Airlines MH370 triggered debate about whether data should be streamed instead.
Staffing at air traffic control tower 'not normal' during collision: report

Air traffic control staffing at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was "not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic," on Wednesday night when a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines jet collided mid-air, according to a new report. 
The air traffic controller who was monitoring helicopters near the airport on Wednesday evening was also monitoring planes taking off and landing, according to the FAA report reviewed by The New York Times. These jobs are typically assigned to two different people, the outlet reported.
The airport's air traffic control tower had been understaffed for years, according to the Times, with just 19 fully certified controllers as of September 2023 despite targets set by the FAA for 30 controllers.

Three U.S. Army soldiers were onboard the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision, a U.S. official has confirmed. Their names have not been officially released. 
Another official said the Army UH-60 helicopter involved in the crash was based out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia. It was later confirmed that the aircraft and its crew were on a training flight.
The crew chief of the helicopter was later identified as Ryan O'Hara.
"Ryan is fondly remembered as a guy who would fix things around the ROTC gym as well as a vital member of the Rifle Team. Ryan leaves behind a wife and 1-year-old son," the Parkview High School JROTC in Georgia wrote on Facebook. 
In a statement shared on X, Georgia governor Brian Kemp paid tribute to both Lilley and O'Hara and sent his "deepest condolences" to their families and friends.
Andrew Eaves was also on the army helicopter, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said on X. 
In a Facebook post on Thursday, Eaves' wife, Carrie Eaves said: "We ask that you pray for our family and friends and for all the other families that are suffering today. We ask for peace while we grieve," the post read.

The targeted disabilities are:

Missing Extremities

Dwarfism 
"Individuals with targeted disabilities have the greatest difficulty obtaining employment. This is the only protected group for which Federal agencies may have a hiring goal," the FAA website reads.

Although the military helicopter was told to fly no higher than 200 feet, it was above 300 feet and was at least a half-mile off the approved route when the crash occurred, the Times reported.
