On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to terminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs within 60 days.
While supporters argue that focusing on merit alone will create a fairer society, this rollback will undo decades of progress aimed at addressing inequality.
As businesses and schools reassess their own diversity efforts, it's important to ask if this is a necessary move toward true equality or a dangerous step backward for America's commitment to inclusivity.
The move has significant impacts beyond the federal workforce. Corporate America, which has faced pressure from activists, is already witnessing a pullback in diversity initiatives. A Forbes article says that companies such as Walmart have dialed back DEI efforts, and under the new administration, this trend is expected to continue. 
According to CNN, educational institutions are also at a crossroads. With the federal government rescinding support for DEI programs, colleges and universities may face challenges in maintaining initiatives aimed at fostering inclusive environments. The absence of federal endorsement could lead to a re-evaluation of diversity policies on campuses nationwide. 
According to The Guardian, some people argue that dismantling DEI programs undermines progress made toward equal opportunity and inclusivity. They believe that such actions may reverse efforts to address systemic inequalities in both the workplace and educational settings. 
Supporters of the executive order believe that focusing solely on individual qualifications promotes a more equitable environment. 
Marginalized communities are more vulnerable to discrimination. Efforts to dismantle DEI programs are "the latest effort to dismantle systems designed to foster racial equity and progress," the American Civil Liberties Union said.
As we move forward, it's important to think about what this change really means. Will ending DEI programs create a fair society, or will it undo years of progress? We need to ask ourselves if this move will help everyone get equal opportunities, or if it will make it harder for some to succeed.
