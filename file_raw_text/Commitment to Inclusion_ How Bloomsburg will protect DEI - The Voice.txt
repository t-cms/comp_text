Commitment to Inclusion: How Bloomsburg will protect DEI
Bri Raymond, Growl Editor
February 26, 2025
What Happened and Why It Matters 
As Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs come under fire at all universities nationwide, Commonwealth University - Bloomsburg is standing its ground. In the wake of the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle DEI initiatives in higher education by threatening federal funding and rolling back policies designed to foster inclusivity, Bloomsburg leaders remain steadfast in their mission to create a campus where every student belongs. 
"The work that we should do should impact everyone," said Kenneth Hall, Chief DEI officer during a Zoom interview, reinforcing the university's commitment to ensuring that DEI is not just a concept but an active, integral part of the student experience. 
Despite political pressures and executive orders aiming to restrict DEI efforts, Bloomsburg refuses to waver. Through programs, workshops, leadership initiatives, and campus-wide collaboration, the institution continues to provide students with critical opportunities for growth, understanding and inclusion. 
National Attacks on DEI 
Under the Trump administration's recent directives, universities across the country face increasing pressure to eliminate DEI offices, training programs, and scholarship initiatives aimed at supporting marginalized communities 
"We can't control what executive orders are being rolled out," said Madelyn Rodriguez, the Executive Director of DEI at Bloomsburg. "What we can control is making sure students are being educated and feel as though you can go anywhere on campus and feel supported."
 
Climate, Culture, and Community 
At the core of Bloomsburg's DEI efforts is a simple yet powerful philosophy of climate, culture and community, the three C's. Commonwealth University leaders believe that fostering an inclusive environment benefits all students, creating a space where diverse perspectives are valued. 
 
DEI at Bloomsburg isn't just about policies, it's about real student experiences. "Students getting involved is how we learn from each other and educate each other," stated Rodrigez. "The students are the pulse and have these opportunities to get involved." 
 
 "Our plan is to keep moving forward and create high-quality education, and the work that we do is for all students because it affects everyone across all campuses," Rodriguez stated. "The work that we do will never go away and we will always support the students here." 
Inclusive Student Organizations 
Beyond administrative efforts, Bloomsburg's student organizations play a crucial role in making inclusivity a reality on campus. Students have a variety of ways to engage with DEI initiatives firsthand. 
 
Inclusive clubs and student organizations on campus help students feel like they belong and provide education. Some of those include Thank God I am Female , African Student Association, Catholic Campus Ministry and more.  
 
Through student engagement, campus-wide collaboration, and unwavering dedication, Bloomsburg is proving that inclusion is more than just a policy-it's a promise.
