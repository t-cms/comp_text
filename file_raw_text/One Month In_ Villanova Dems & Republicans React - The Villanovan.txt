One Month In: Villanova Dems & Republicans React
Isabella Balian, Staff Writer
February 19, 2025
Villanovan Digital The Villanovan spoke to members of the Villanova Democrat and Republican organizations to reflect on the first month of Trump's presidency.
In the first month of his presidency, newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump has enacted many executive orders and lived up to numerous promises established on the campaign trail. Many of Trump's newly enacted orders focus on immigration, employment and international aid and foreign policy. Taken from the official White House website, Trump outlines his and Vice President J.D. Vance's administration priorities: making America safe again, making America affordable and energy dominant again, draining the swamp and bringing back American values. 
Some notable orders and actions include the Make America Healthy Again Commission, the dismantling of DEI, the implementation of DOGE and restriction of USAID. Others include ending the procurement and forced use of paper straws, protecting second amendment rights, establishing the White House Faith Office, eradicating anti-Christian Bias, imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court, withdrawing the United States form the World Health Organization, ending Covid-19 vaccine mandates in schools and imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. 
The Villanovan spoke to members of the Villanova Democrat and Republican organizations to reflect on the first month of Trump's presidency. Both political groups were very active on campus during the course of the 2024 elections in encouraging students to vote, hosting political candidates and hosting informational meetings. 
A member of the Villanova Democrats and political science student Tyler Denison spoke about his general reactions to Trump's recent actions and executive orders. 
"The first month of Trump's presidency has been upsetting but not surprising," he said. 
Denison spoke on the perception of Trump as a dictator, and authoritarian tactics. 
"He promised to be a dictator on day one, and now we're seeing the chaotic legal consequences of the President trying to shut down government infrastructure and accumulate as much power for himself as possible," Denison said. 
The VU Republicans mentioned the fulfilled promises that happened this month. 
"President Donald J. Trump's first month in office has been characterized by rapid change, fulfilling his campaign promise to try and get things done," Rahul Singh, a member of the VU Republicans Board, said. 
Singh discussed Trump's recent influence and actions toward the international community. 
"Trump has shown himself to be an advocate for the United States both internationally and domestically," he said. 
Singh mentioned that 11 hostages had been freed from foreign nations and that Trump  himself has met with and spoken to many leaders in the international political community. In addition to Trump's actions with the international community, Singh also mentioned reforms within other governmental departments. 
"The Trump administration has additionally begun addressing border security and the energy crisis through executive orders and new departmental oversight by confirmed cabinet members," he said. 
Singh mentioned Trump's promises within the oil and energy sector. 
"Regarding energy, the Trump administration's promise to revamp the oil industry will bring down international costs of this vital resource, with India, South Korea and Japan already in line to import U.S. oil," Singh said. 
On Jan. 20, 2025, Trump signed an executive order, "Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid." This order included a "90-day pause in United States foreign development assistance for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy."
At the beginning of February, Trump said USAID has been "unaccountable to taxpayers as it funnels massive sums of money to the ridiculous - and, in many cases, malicious - pet projects of entrenched bureaucrats, with next-to-no oversight."
Denison cited the restriction of USAID as a disappointing action at the beginning of the presidency. 
"The shutdown of USAID was particularly concerning for me," he said. 
He also discussed Musk's role in and influence on Trump's orders. 
"To see Elon Musk, the richest man alive, claim that a program which provides humanitarian aid for thousands of people around the world is wasteful feels deeply hypocritical," Denison said. 
Despite the discussion of Trump, Singh mentioned that the Republican Party is not a monolith. 
"At the same time, Villanova College Republicans hold that Trump is a member of the Republican Party, not its embodiment," he said. "Both major political parties can concede that Trump, like every president, has his strengths and weaknesses. Trump has been getting things done, fueled by support within the party and outside of it."
Both students also reflected on respective hopes for the next few months of Trump's presidency. 
"The best case scenario for the next few months of Trump's presidency is that his aggression and stubbornness help him negotiate a peace deal that protects Ukraine's independence, but given his past comments on the issue I'm doubtful we'll see that," Denison said. 
  "Villanova College Republicans hope that the next few months of Trump's presidency will continue to address the concerns of not only the American people but the international community, as well," Singh said.
