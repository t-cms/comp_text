President Donald Trump time and time again has boasted about his ignorance of Project 2025. Yet, everything he has implemented closely aligns with the more than 900 page writings of Project 2025. In fact, most of his cabinet members, down to his press secretary, have had a key role in constructing the documentation of Project 2025.
Project 2025 was constructed in 2022 by The Heritage Foundation and 140 former Trump staffers. The project strives for an extreme right-winged blueprint for the United States. The project rolls back federal agencies, federally funded corporations, several women's rights protections, LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant rights, healthcare and racial equity to name a few highlights.  
Trump has implemented more than a dozen policies that have closely aligned or flat out been written in Project 2025. Despite initial denials, Trump's actions have followed through with Project 2025's proposals to transform the government into his ideal conservative framework.
One of the objectives of Project 2025 was the dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion. DEI is the federal program that advocates for fair treatment of everyone. Whether that be handicapped parking spots or flexible hours for parents, DEI is everywhere, often without being recognized. 
On page 258, Project 2025 states its promise to eliminate DEI in federal workplaces and education and eventually further its boundaries. Trump announced at his inauguration that DEI would be banned shortly, and that promise was fulfilled shortly after. His most recent hand in eliminating DEI was sending a threat to public schools that continue to use DEI and will no longer be federally funded. 
From pages 417-448, Project 2025 takes a deep dive into their extremism rhetoric in terms of climate change and environmental rollbacks. Trump has been widely recognized as historically the worst U.S. president for the environment. Despite his condemnation of Project 2025, the things he spews align perfectly with what Project 2025 states. 
On day one, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accords, the biggest climate change alliance in the world with over 200 countries as members. 
Another announcement on day one was his advancements in the "Drill Baby Drill" agenda. This would increase carbon dioxide to over 4 billion tonnes. 
Recently, he is reevaluating the Federal Emergency Management Agency and teetering back and forth with the idea of eliminating it as a whole. This is the agency that helps with relief for cities affected by natural disasters and emergency situations. 
With this, he is also working to cut the Environmental Protection Agency . The latest rollback was the cuts of over 3,000 national park and forest service workers nationwide. This represents about 15% of this field. All of these environmental protections that were abolished are written out in one way or another in Project 2025. 
Probably Trump's most notorious action so far in his second term has been his extreme immigration measures. The way he goes about deportation is written out to a tee in Project 2025. From pages 137-151, Project 2025 goes into incredible detail about how migrants should be treated and "handled." The document views immigrants, of any sort, to be deteriorating our country. 
Trump has denied knowing anything about Project 2025 and has disassociated with any implications of it. However, his supporters, cabinet members and the proposals he is turning into law completely contradict this. 
At this point, there is no denying Trump's implications in Project 2025. The exact page numbers in Project 2025 align perfectly with what Trump is trying to accomplish. The parallels in the document and Trump's actions are far too similar to be a coincidence
Trump's second term initiatives reflect a comprehensive adoption of Project 2025's framework. Trump is trying to make a transformative era in America and is using the writings in Project 2025 as a guideline. 
The alignments not only fulfill these conservative objectives but also contradict the Constitution, federal agencies and executive authority. The U.S. would suffer immensely if even half of the things in Project 2025 were put into place. At the rate that these extremist laws are being passed, America should be alarmed for what is to come.
