New federal DEI cuts and regulations could affect hiring in government and private sectors. ORACLE GRAPHIC/ WILL RAINSBERGER
Jordan Brumit is a nonbinary USF student. For Brumit, the removal of DEI programs impacts not only their career prospects but their ability to express their identity.
"I already feel overlooked because of my gender identity," said Brumit, a doctoral student in politics and international affairs. "Now, if I want to go into politics, I'll have to hide a part of myself, my goals and morals because of DEI being cut."
Policy changes at both the state and federal levels have reduced DEI programs in universities and government, affecting hiring practices and Florida university funding. 
As a result, some USF students are reconsidering their future, fearing fewer job opportunities.

In 2024, the Florida Board of Governors approved Regulation 9.016, titled "Prohibited Expenditures," banning the use of state and federal funds for DEI programs or activities in state universities.
But DEI cuts have transcended state regulations.
On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order eliminating all DEI and diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs in the federal government. It also requires federal agencies to close related offices and positions
The order, titled "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing," also revokes Executive Order 11246, which prohibited employment discrimination based on race, color, sex or national origin by federal contractors. 
Brumit said they worry private organizations may "follow suit" to stay in the government's "good graces" and remove their DEI practices.
Some of the companies that have rolled back DEI are Google, Meta and McDonald's, according to Associated Press news.
"Private corporations and the government employ a lot of people," Brumit said. "But with the rollback of DEI, many won't feel safe being employed in the private sector."
The executive order aims to end DEI in the private sector, including universities, referencing their use of DEI for "biased and unlawful" hiring practices and "illegal" admission preferences. 
To comply with the order, the Department of Education has dissolved its Diversity & Inclusion Council, canceled DEI training and removed online resources that encouraged institutions to promote DEI, according to the Department of Education.

Tessa Barber, a doctoral student in International Affairs and Politics at USF, said the elimination of federal DEI programs is making her reconsider her goal to work as an adviser in Congress.
"I would love to work for the government, but I've been considering working for the private sector since they might retain their DEI policies," Barber said.
Barber said she is unsure whether she wants to work where people are "not being given the same opportunities."
"The American dream is that everyone has the same opportunities to excel, thrive, have a great job and education regardless of their background," Barber said. "I don't think I would want to work somewhere that is fighting against that."
Florida State House Representative Anna Eskamani, a Democrat representing District 42 in Orange County, said cutting DEI programs removes opportunities that make higher education accessible to all Floridians.
"We've seen universities eliminate programs and faculty have low morale because their research intersects with these subjects," Eskamani said. "Programs are at risk." 
In March 2024, USF closed its DEI office to comply with the BOG regulation. Staff members were reassigned to different roles within the university.
Eskamani said one of the potential consequences of the federal removal of DEI is increased difficulty in "hiring, attracting and retaining" talent at a national level.
"These executive orders don't stop at the federal government, they don't stop at higher education, they go into all parts of civic society," Eskamani said.
She said working under DEI cuts has been "stressful" because it stops the legislature from working on "everyday problems," such as housing affordability and insurance. 
Dale M. Rodriguez, an employment law attorney and USF alumnus, said the meaning of DEI has been "twisted" in political discourse. He said DEI has been misrepresented as a form of "preferential treatment" for minority groups.
"DEI is the recognition that certain groups of people in the U.S., like minorities or females, have not always had access to opportunity on the same level that white males, for example, would have," Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez said he is concerned that by removing DEI initiatives, people will feel discouraged from speaking up about discrimination.
"When you live in a moment in history where it seems the majority is not going to be receptive to your complaints, it makes it so people don't want to stand up for their rights," Rodriguez said.

Eskamani said students should communicate with their university's Board of Trustees about their concerns regarding DEI removal.
"Make sure your BOT knows why these programs are important to you," Eskamani said. "Even if they don't agree with you, they still need to hear from you. You have to not surrender."
Despite changes in DEI policies, Brumit said there is still hope of overcoming the challenges resulting from their cuts.
"You can be frustrated, you can feel hopeless, but this isn't the first time we've struggled with not being listened to, and each time we have overcome that," Brumit said.
