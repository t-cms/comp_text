Cornyn Praises Pres. Trump for Dismantling Biden's Discriminatory DEI Regime
WASHINGTON - Today on the floor, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) tore into the Biden-Harris administration's DEI regime and praised President Trump for dismantling it as one of his first actions of this new administration. Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn's remarks are below, and video can be found here.
"It's been four days... since President Trump took the oath of office as the 47th President of the United States."
"I'm particularly pleased to see him dismantling the Biden-Harris administration's DEI regime throughout the federal government."
"DEI initiatives do the exact opposite of what they purport to do, and they fly directly in the face of everything that America stands for."
"The policies that were intended to end racial discrimination have evolved into the modern DEI apparatus, creating a new kind of discrimination, something we sought to avoid but which has now crept back into our country."
"President Trump's actions earlier this week are not a reversal of the progress we've made since the civil rights movement. They are better understood as the righting of the ship back to what Congress and the nation intended to accomplish: a nation where all people have a chance to succeed or fail based on their merit and not on race."
"This action by President Trump, rather than reversing progress, is a return to the ideal that the United States of America should have always stood for but unfortunately did not, which is that the equal dignity and equal treatment of every American under the law."
