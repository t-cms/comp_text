Topline
President Donald Trump doubled down on his attacks against the Federal Aviation Administration s diversity, equity and inclusion policies in aTruth Socialpost Friday morning following the fatal collision between an American Airlines plane and an army helicopter but he has not provided evidence DEI was related to the crash, and these policies have existed at the FAA for years, including during his first term.

Key Facts
Trump posted screenshots of X posts and articles toTruth SocialFriday morning to slam an FAA commitment to hiring people with disabilities, stating this is  one reason why our Country WAS going to hell  but according to Internet Archive screenshots from2017and2019, the same language about hiring employees with disabilities was active on the FAA s website during Trump s first term.
Trump s post contained quotes of the same now-deleted passage from the FAA s website that he quoted during his press conference Thursday, which stated the FAA had committed to hiring people with  severe  disabilities because they are the  most under-represented segment  of the workforce, including those with  missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis,  and  epilepsy. 
Trump has also not provided evidence anyone involved in the crash had disabilities.
Though Trump blamed former President Joe Biden and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the FAA s diversity website listed a commitment to hiring diverse and disabled candidates as early as 2013, according to theInternet Archive, and throughout Trump s first term.
Trump also suggested people with disabilities are being hired as air traffic controllers, though the FAA clarified toFox Newslast year it employs people for a  wide range of positions, from administrative roles to oversight and execution of critical safety functions,  all of whom must meet  rigorous qualifications. 
The FAA has also operated a program to boost hiring of candidates with disabilities, which also existed during Trump s first term, according to FAAannual reports, and a 2023reportstates the  participants must meet the same qualifications as any other applicants. 
The FAA also posted on X (then Twitter) about itsdiversity commitmentsand commitments to hiring and trainingworkers with disabilitiesthroughout Trump s first term.
What Did Trump Say At Thursday s Press Conference?
Trump said the crash  could have been  caused by diversity hiring in response to a question from a reporter without providing evidence, though he acknowledged  we don t know  and the investigation is ongoing. But Trump used the press conference to attack the FAA s DEI policies, stating Buttigieg ran the Transportation Department  right into the ground with his diversity  and slammed the FAA for committing to hiring people with  severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. 
What Did Trump s Faa Executive Order Do?
Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 22 eliminating policies he said  prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and efficiency  at the FAA. His executive order alleges  the Biden FAA specifically recruited and hired individuals with  severe intellectual  disabilities,  and his executive order called for the FAA to pivot to  non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring.  At Trump spress conferenceThursday morning, a reporter asked whether Trump s executive order was successful because the crash happened after the order, to which Trump said  we re in the process of making those changes. 
Key Background
Trump has madeeliminating DEIa central focus of his first days in office. On his first day, Trump issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to drop their DEI programs and, days later, he signed another executive order directing the military, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to ditch their DEI offices and policies. Trump s DEI attacks have been accompanied by a series of companiesrolling backtheir DEI programs, including Meta, Amazon and Target, though others, like Costco and Delta Airlines, have stood firm behind their diversity commitments.
News Peg
An American Airlines passenger plane and military helicoptercollidedmidair outside Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. late Wednesday night, with no survivors among the 67 people on board, Trump confirmed at his press conference.
Tangent
Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., also questioned whether DEI played a role in the fatal crash in an appearance onFox Business Networkthis morning, though he did not provide evidence. Republicans have pointed fingers at DEI after other recent disasters, including the wildfires in Los Angeles and a truck driver crashing into a crowd of people inNew Orleans. Sen.Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., sent a letter to the FBI alleging  the Bureau has prioritized Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives over its core mission of protecting the American people,  days after the New Orleans attack.
