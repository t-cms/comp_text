The following information was released by the office of Alabama Rep. Terri A. Sewell:
Today,
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) released the following statement on the removal of the Tuskegee Airmen from the Air Force curriculum as a result of President Trumps Executive Order on diversity, equity, and inclusion:
The Tuskegee Airmen bravely fought and died for our freedoms before this nation even granted them the full benefits of citizenship. To strip them from the Air Force curriculum is an outrageous betrayal of our values as Americans. Their heroism is not DEI. It is American history.
Im calling on the Air Force to immediately reverse this decision. We will not let our history be erased.
