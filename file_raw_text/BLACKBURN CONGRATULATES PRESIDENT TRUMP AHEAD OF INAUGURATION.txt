The following information was released by Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn:
U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) released the following statement ahead of Donald J. Trump's swearing-in as the 47th President of the United States:
"Over the past four years, the Biden-Harris administration wasted billions of Americans' tax dollars on a radical, left-wing agenda, decimated the safe and secure border they inherited from President Trump, fell behind on the world stage, and prioritized woke DEI initiatives over competence," said Senator Blackburn . "Today, President Trump will hit the ground running to make America safe, healthy, prosperous, and affordable again. He will also restore our broken border, carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, and put money back in the pockets of Americans across the country who are struggling to make ends meet. Congratulations to President Trump on this tremendous occasion. I am looking forward to seeing all he accomplishes for the American people in the next four years to make America great once again."
