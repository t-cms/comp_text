Rep. Takano Joins CAPAC Leadership in Condemning President Trump's Attempt to Blame DEI Policies on Aviation Tragedy
January 30, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C - Today, Representative Mark Takano joined the leadership of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) in issuing the following statement in response to President Trump's attempt to blame diversity, equity, and inclusion policies following a horrific aviation tragedy in Washington, D.C.
"As families grieve the loss of their loved ones in last night's aviation crash, President Trump does not offer any semblance of compassion or leadership. Instead, he is exploiting this tragedy to advance his discriminatory agenda and further divide Americans.
"President Trump has made baseless claims that seek to blame people of color for this horrific tragedy. It is despicable. We don't need racist lies, we need answers, and a leader who will put aside partisan politics to unite our country. President Trump has failed to meet this moment. The American people deserve better."
Rep. Takano made the statement with Representatives Grace Meng, Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Second Vice Chair Jill Tokuda (HI-02), Whip Ami Bera (CA-06), Freshman Representative Suhas Subramanyam (VA-10), and Chair Emerita Judy Chu (CA-28)
