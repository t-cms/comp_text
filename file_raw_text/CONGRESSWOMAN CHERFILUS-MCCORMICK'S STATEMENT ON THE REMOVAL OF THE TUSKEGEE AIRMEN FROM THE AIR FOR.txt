The following information was released by the office of Florida Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick:
Today, Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick issued the following statement on the removal of the Tuskegee Airmen from the Air Force's history.
"President Trump's decision to stop teaching Air Force recruits about the Tuskegee Airmen in the name of banning DEI initiatives is deeply troubling and misguided. Teaching the history of the Tuskegee Airmen is not about diversity training; it is about honoring American history.
These brave men fought valiantly for our nation during World War II, overcoming unimaginable racism and prejudice both on the battlefield and upon their return home. They served with distinction, proving that courage knows no color, and their legacy serves as a testament to the resilience and excellence that define the American spirit.
I urge the Air Force to restore the Tuskegee Airmen to their rightful place of recognition and honor within the Air Force's training process."
