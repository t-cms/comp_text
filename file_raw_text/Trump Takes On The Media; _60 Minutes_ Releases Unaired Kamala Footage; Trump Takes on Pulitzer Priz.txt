SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: What an amazing life and career. What a great guy too.
All right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening. Please set your DVR so you never ever, ever, ever miss an episode of Hannity.
As always, thank you for being with us. Thank you for making the show possible. In the meantime, let not your heart be trouble. Greg Gutfeld is next to put a smile on your face. Have a great night.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I know. I know. I know. Your adulation, it's almost getting boring.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Happy Thursday, everyone. So Mitch McConnell is reportedly fine after falling down the stairs. Medical personnel credit his hard shell.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: CBS has released their full unedited 60 Minute interview with Kamala Harris. Apparently, they left out a part where Kamala said she was allergic to mold, which could explain why you rarely saw her standing next to Joe Biden.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Now we're not sure how much they doctored the chat, but they left out the clip of her arriving to the interview by boat.
(VIDEO PLAYING)
GUTFELD: As you know, Sunday is the Super Bowl, which means that --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
GUTFELD: Shut up.
(LAUGHTER)
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Super Bowl?
GUTFELD: Which means in less than forty eight hours, JB Pritzker will start filling his hot tub with ranch dressing.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: For the big game, the NFL will remove the words end racism from the end zone to be replaced by something more appropriate.
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Daniel Penny has landed a new job in finance at a major firm.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: They already have a sign up that says, if choking, do not let Daniel apply the Heimlich.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Apparently, the Biden administration and USAID authorized $20 million to create a version of Sesame Street in Iraq. In this version, when the cookie monster steals cookies, they cut off his hands.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
GUTFELD: He's still happy though.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Tren De Aragua gang bangers were among the first criminals loaded onto a plane and shipped to Gitmo. When they arrived, the concierge said their room wouldn't be ready till one, but they could enjoy a complimentary waterboarding on the house.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Ron DeSantis is pushing for a tax holiday with no sales tax on guns and ammo in Florida. He calls it Second Amendment Summer. Hell, for me, every summer is second amendment summer with these guns.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: And that is not AI.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right. So we've all heard about DOGE, the new agency aimed at cutting the fat in our government. Now to be fair, Trump already managed to cut a lot already.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But there's plenty more to go. And in fact, it's such a good idea. You got to ask yourself, why stop at government? Why not the media? And then cut the stuff nobody wants. Right?
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
GUTFELD: I love how they're only upset about Jesse.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I knew that was going to happen. So funny. But when you think about it, there is so much waste, and a true audit on the media industrial complex might finally expose the incestuous relationship between that and the Dems they serve.
Well, it appears to be happening, and once again, it's thanks to the orange wrecking ball. Exhibit A, Donald Trump's case against the committee that chooses the Pulitzer Prizes. Turns out that after the Pulitzer Committee gave their 2018 award for national reporting to the Washington Post and the New York Times for reporting the Russiagate hoax as real, you know, when they should have won in the category of fiction. Trump sued not the paper, but the Pulitzer or Pulitzer. Who gives a (BEEP).
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Now Trump wasn't looking for money. What he really wanted us to was to show that the award committee and their media were in bed together like Anna Navarro in a tub of whipped Velveeta.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: For example, Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson chaired the same committee that gave his own paper, the Pulitzer for bogus reporting. I've seen less favoritism when Jesse writes books about himself.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But it wasn't just Robinson according to the Washington Free Beacon. Journalists and execs from the New York Times, NPR, Bloomberg, USA Today also served on the board. It was one big circle jerk, which is coincidentally my nickname for J. Pritzker.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So yesterday, Trump won a major victory. A judge found enough for the case to go forward, which means the discovery phase is coming. Meaning all the emails about the Russiagate stories could get exposed, thus showing and proving yet again it was a bigger sham than Elizabeth Warren's collection of tomahawks.
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: But Trump's DOGEing of the media is far from done. You know 60 Minutes, the show where instead of using makeup artists, they use morticians.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Thanks to Trump's lawsuit against CBS, the network had to release the full transcript of the Kamala Harris interview they did before the election. And the interview got more surgery than Nancy Pelosi's face and Dick Cheney's heart combined.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: What's your problem? Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAMALA HARRIS (D), FORMER U.S. VICE President: It's going to be taxes. It's going to be literally if the economists -- I mean, they're from each spectrum --
BILL WHITAKER, 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT, CBS NEWS: : But I hear what you're saying about the economist
HARRIS: You must be very thoughtful about how you use that microphone in front of you. And, you know, when I was attorney general, the words I spoke could move markets.
You know what picture day is for our children? They get excited the night before, we put out the clothes they're going to wear. They go to school making sure their faces are clean and their hair is done. And, they go to school for picture day. And you know what happened to these children? They had to evacuate that day because of the fear of the threats that were being issued in Springfield because of the words of Donald Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
GUTFELD: Nearly all our commentary on foreign affairs, including on Israel and Iran, were also cleaned up. I haven't seen a turd get this polished since Jim Acosta got a facial.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Did it work? Well, Kamala isn't president. But you can't say they didn't try. Meanwhile, Trump just settled with ABC News for 15 mil. Meta just settled with him for 25 mil. CBS parent company Paramount is reportedly considering a similar payout. Pretty soon, Trump will be able to afford Bret Baier's house.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Trump also sued the Des Moines Register and veteran pollster, Ann Seltzer, for claiming Kamala was leading him in the Iowa polls. Makes sense. We all knew that poll was nuttier than a (BEEP) pic from mister Peanut.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But it didn't stop the media from reporting it like it was real. So it's kind of fun watching Trump set his sights on these fools. God forbid, they open the books on "The View." You'll probably find secret payments to ham hawks by mail.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Meanwhile, the old guard is fleeing. Andrea Mitchell says she's bailing on MSNBC for better opportunities. And why not? I'm sure there's a science museum somewhere that needs a medical skeleton.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Terrible.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Acosta just left CNN, a shock to CNN who had no idea he still worked there.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Chuck Todd is gone seeking better opportunities as the before picture for the HairClub for Men.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So as Fox's numbers are never better, the competition dropped like turds out of a donkey's ass. And why? Well, the coup failed. One thing we learned from DOGE is that our government loves to create artificial instability in other countries. Under the guise of aid, they enlist activists, the media, and aim to silence dissent through censorship outfits.
It's pretty clear now that they weren't just doing this in places like the Ukraine. They were doing it here too. Government and media jammed up four years of conflict, all to install a puppet, but it didn't work. Trump won. And now the people behind it, they aren't working either. Couldn't hap -- happen to a nicer bunch.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(ANNOUNCER: PERIOD!)
GUTFELD: Let's welcome tonight's guests. He's got lots of style and keeps his cash in a pile. Host of "Making Money" on Fox Business, Charles Payne.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: She covers the polls like hot butter on rolls. Republican Strategist Erin Perrine.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: He looks like a roadie for a Loverboy tribute band. Comedian Adam Hunter.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: And we're prepared for the worst, because she's ready to burst. New York Times bestselling author and Fox New Contributor Kat Timpf.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Charles. Wow, with the -- that's the Kamala interview. Could you imagine if she had one? Jesus.
CHARLES PAYNE, "MAKING MONEY" HOST: Man, we dodged the bullet.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PAYNE: I mean, really --
GUTFELD: He -- Trump dodged the bullet, but she really dodged --
(LAUGHTER)
PAYNE: America dodged the bullet. Yeah. I mean, are you kidding me? Everything would be upside down. But, you know, it's so funny how life is, the last song -- I was listening to music right before coming into the studio. The last song I heard was, Wrapped Around Your Finger.
And the line, right? I will turn your face to alabaster when you find your servant is your master.
PAYNE: Wow.
GUTFELD: Trump should call the media every day and sing that to him. He should call CNN, MSNBC, CBS, because he won.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
PAYNE: He won. And guess what? The American public won.
GUTFELD: You know what? I feel like I just won.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
PAYNE: Yeah. You were the Barry White of Fox News.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Remember Barry White?
PAYNE: Oh, of course. Yeah.
GUTFELD: Jeez man.
PAYNE: I got lucky a few times with Barry White. Not with him, but his music.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I'm glad you made that clear.
PAYNE: It's a hell of a sight to see I had to clean that up quick. I know some people go to dinner after this.
GUTFELD: So Erin, so, what did you think of what's happening with the media now and Trump? It's kind of interesting, because they always talk about, they want transparency in media, and now he's delivering.
ERIN PERRINE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yeah. I actually think that this is a great strategy for anybody who does an interview or works in politics, any politician, record every interview you do. And if media wants to restore any level of credibility, the legacy media, the left leaning legacy media, they should always release every transcript and every full interview. I don't know why they wouldn't.
If you are giving people the space to say you're not being truthful, then give them the opportunity to read all of it. But the media is so entrenched in the left wing propaganda that they try to push and in trying to stop Donald Trump. You've seen it since 2015, and they failed time and again. Why? Because they think the American people are idiots. And I don't mean that rudely, but they do.
Because if they thought the American people were smart, they wouldn't try to pull one over with you to make you think that Kamala Harris should have been president of The United States. She shouldn't have been. She didn't have a policy platform, and she couldn't even articulate why she wanted to be president.
Let alone the fact that she had been vice president for the largest disaster of a presidency in modern times. But they didn't want you to see that.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: So true. Adam, I have a challenge for you.
ADAM HUNTER, COMEDIAN: Yes.
GUTFELD: How can you turn Trump's recent success into a plethora of gross, dirty, and disturbing jokes?
HUNTER: Funny you should ask, Greg.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: But I -- look, because of Trump, the media is being exposed more than Kanye's wife. But --
PERRINE: There's one.
HUNTER: It's like --
PAYNE: There's one.
HUNTER: I mean, they bury the Russia hoax story. Right? But then they put out this story, which is like -- I mean, that means -- again -- OK. They buried the Hunter Biden story, but then they put out this story. Mean meanwhile, like, Hunter saw more crack than Joy Behar's toilet seat.
(LAUGHTER)
PAYNE: Keep going.
HUNTER: They give an -- I mean, they basically the Pulitzer Prize to a fake news story.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
HUNTER: That's like the NRA giving a hunting award to Alec Baldwin. You know?
GUTFELD: It makes sense.
HUNTER: Or, like, Diddy winning the teen choice awards. You know?
GUTFELD: He had his choice of teens.
HUNTER: Good point. Good point. But I just like, who gave him the award? Like, George Santos? That was great.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Kat?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Kat. Kat?
TIMPF: Yes.
GUTFELD: What say you?
TIMPF: Yes.
GUTFELD: Isn't it funny though that we always knew the Pulitzer Prizes were bull (BEEP).
TIMPF: Oh, yeah. Of course -- because we've never gotten one.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: For the hard hitting journalism that is this show.
GUTFELD: That that, that expose we did on the Canadian shop t-shirt with the big breasts, nobody was following that story except for us.
TIMPF: I would say it's actually even fair to say except for you.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: I was forced to follow it --
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: -- by you.
GUTFELD: Giant boobed lady man.
TIMPF: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And they're really just -- but I think that there really are just two Americas. I think that there's people that haven't seen this and then there's people that will just point out only the more ridiculous aspects of Trump, his -- some of his losses, which there were ridiculous ones, of course. When he said CBS, he said that Kamala interview cost him 10 billion in damages, which is ridiculous.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: But there's also people who -- obviously, that interview, you have to acknowledge was edited in her favor. If they were really sitting down and Trump was mumbling and stumbling like that, would they have cut that out? I believe no. But it I think it's just we're in this media now where it's like, OK, if you say something positive about Trump, then you're a Trump lackey. If you say something negative about Trump, then you're anti- Trump.
It's -- the more independent, uncut, unedited thought we can get out there, I think better the better.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: I disagree. I don't. I just thought I said -- I'd say I disagree. OK. We got to move on.
Up next, the NFL decides to yield over a phrase on the field.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(ANNOUNCER: A STORY IN 5 WORDS)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: No more end zone politics. Kat, the phrase, "End Racism" will not be painted in the end zones at this Sunday's Super Bowl airing on Fox, by the way. They're opting for "Choose Love" instead, and the NFL says that "Choose Love" is appropriate to use as our country with the recent wildfires in Southern California, the terrorist attack in New Orleans, the plane and helicopter crashes in our nation's capital, and the plane crash in Philadelphia.
My theory is that "Choose Love" was so stupid that they had to mention all these other things so you wouldn't criticize it. But that's not going to stop me. "Choose Love" is lame.
TIMPF: Well --
GUTFELD: Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame.
TIMPF: Well, as an expert in both football and racism --
PAYNE: You are. You are.
GUTFELD: You are. You are drafted by the KKK.
TIMPF: I think -- I think that honestly, I think it makes sense because I think they're trying to be more positive.
GUTFELD: Oh, OK.
TIMPF: I think because I think choosing love also includes ending racism.
GUTFELD: Yes. I see. Yes.
TIMPF: I don't even want to know -- you're about to say something disgusting?
GUTFELD: Yes. I was.
TIMPF: OK.
GUTFELD: And I'm glad you cut me off because it would've ended my career.
TIMPF: I think that for the four years of the Biden administration, it was a lot of getting called racist, sexist, sometimes just for simply existing. I think in the case of academia, for example. And then I think that that's a major reason why a lot of people voted for Trump for the first time. Because they were like, OK. I'm going to vote for the side that isn't telling me basically I should kill myself.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: Right? So I think that that's probably they're trying to be more positive in getting the message.
GUTFELD: That leads me to the obvious question, Erin, why have a message at all? Why do we need a public service announcement on the field?
TIMPF: It's got to be valuable ad space.
PERRINE: Yes.
GUTFELD: Yes. I want an ad for Coca Cola or rectal aid.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: There you go. There you go.
PERRINE: All right. Well, that's your choice.
GUTFELD: Don't knock it.
PERRINE: It's all about --
GUTFELD: just for the butthole. You know?
PAYNE: It is the end zone, by the way.
PERRINE: My gosh.
GUTFELD: It is the end zone.
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Thank you, Charles.
PERRINE: That took a turn. I should've seen coming, but I didn't want to acknowledge. It's all about virtue singling. It always is in sports. And I saw Keith Olbermann was freaking out because now it means that the NFL doesn't send end racism, it means they support racism. Well, that means that Keith Olbermann is probably a racist because he's not wearing an end racism pin every day of his life.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERRINE: This was never about this. But the NFL should just get back to football because as a fan of the Buffalo Bills and a Bills Mafia member, I would love the NFL to find a ref who knows what a first down looks like.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
TIMPF: I would also love to know what a first down looks like.
PERRINE: Kat, come on over. We'll watch a game. You'll never want to watch another Super Bowl game.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Adam, do you believe that, racism has finally been eradicated and we don't need that on the end zone?
HUNTER: I'm not sure this is the place. You know? It's like when I was watching the NBA and they used to have black lives matter. And I'm like, yes, they obviously matter. Just especially in this game.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: Like, without black people, his games would be three to two and double overtime. You know? But, yeah, I think there's a time and place. I think they should have end racism, but they should give it on, like, cars. You know? That way when, like, an Asian guy cuts you off, you don't assume it's just because he's Asian.
You know what I'm saying? And by the way --
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: By the way, I do love Asian girls. That's why I hang out at traffic school.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: So but, yeah, the whole thing about the whole, like, choose love and end race, I hope the person actually -- whoever's doing that, like, gets confused and he puts, like, end love, you know, or, like, choose racism. You know, like, that would just be --
But, interesting that you asked me about Trump going to the game because, Doug --
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Didn't ask you. But I will ask you.
HUNTER: Yes.
GUTFELD: What about Trump going to the game.
HUNTER: Crazy because, this is the first sitting president to be at the game. Like, Biden was going to go, but Hunter kept snorting the lines off the field.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Yeah. Charles, what say you?
PAYNE: I agree it's the wrong venue. You know, it's really hard when you've got the collective teams making a hundred million dollars on Sunday. Right?
GUTFELD: Yeah.
PAYNE: Wrong venue. However, if it was like the U.S. yacht finals --
(LAUGHTER)
PAYNE: -- and it was a ship that Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is driving. Right? Then it would be appropriate. Right? I think it's all the virtual signaling stuff is overdone. So, you know, let's have fun with the game. Maybe the refs, they'll probably call this game straight. We'll give Kansas City a little bit of an edge.
GUTFELD: It is interesting. I do think you're seeing, the Trump effect in so many different ways. You're now be able to say certain things that you would have been yelled at, before you can talk about the lunacy of the left and not worry about being canceled. But also the virtue signaling, people like, we don't need to do that.
PAYNE: It was rough too, like, you know, to having to know people's pronouns really threw me off a lot. Like, him, her, she, they. The they threw me off more than anything else. What the hell? But you're they? Like, what the -- who is they?
GUTFELD: Yeah. Where are they?
(LAUGHTER)
PAYNE: Yeah. Just like, I'm talking about everyone was civil. Like, how many people are inside this body? They.
GUTFELD: But you know what -- you know what?
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
PAYNE: That's a few.
GUTFELD: It's why are they getting off without us humiliating them for putting us through this? It's like they're just -- they're -- all of a sudden, they're just doing a never mind.
PAYNE: Yeah.
HUNTER: Yeah.
GUTFELD: Everybody's losing their pronouns. We're no longer doing this. No. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. You put us through a lot of crap.
PAYNE: Yeah.
GUTFELD: They did. They did.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Well done. Up next, the Ivy League gets sued for making girls swim with a dude.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five more words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE) GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Athletes sue over Lia's records. Erin, this is so exciting. Three of Lia, is it Leah, Lia? Who gives a --
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Lia Thomas's former teammates are suing her, or him, at the University of PA to wipe out Lia's records. So they filed a suit one day before Trump signed his E.O. banning -- boy, did I read this wrong or what.
ADAM HUNTER, COMEDIAN: They are suing the school.
GUTFELD: What?
HUNTER: They are suing the school.
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: This guy had to fact-check you?
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: I'm going to start over. Am I having a stroke?
All right, three of Lia Thomas's former teammates at the University of Pennsylvania are suing their alma mater to wipe out Lia's records because, you know, she was that he, blah, blah, blah. Do you follow me?
ERIN PERRINE, AXIOM STRATEGIES: Yes.
GUTFELD: OK.
PERRINE: And you know what, they should be suing the University of Pennsylvania, because these ivy league schools have been screaming about fairness and feminism. But the opportunity they had to support women when they stood up said that is making me uncomfortable and I'm not OK with what is happening as a woman in a female locker room, what did they do? They told them to shut up. They told them to keep to themselves, and they told them that they were the problem.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: That is true. Again, it's the Trump effect. It's like now you can say these things, and you notice there's no pushback. It's not like there's going to be some trans appraising. There never was. This was kind of a figment in the imaginations of some extreme activists.
CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS: It's amazing how much power they had, though. Really, this was lunacy. This was absolute lunacy. And you were talking about retribution. At least they were swimming. What about in the Olympics of boxing. Oh, my God, that one woman, the first punch, she was like, oh, hell no.
(LAUGHTER)
PAYNE: Take the gloves off. Hell, no. Never been hit like that before. They were pummeled. Those women in the Olympics were pummeled, pummeled. They should be able to sue the Olympics the host city. This is crazy.
(APPLAUSE)
PAYNE: Whoever thought this was fair, and to your point, so-called advocates for women were the ones who pushed this.
PERRINE: And then when women stood up and said this isn't OK as women, we were told to shut up. Yes.
GUTFELD: It's so interesting how there are certain women, like Martina Navratilova, she spoke out. But then there were other women that were -- thank you.
PAYNE: It's so weird with her, she spoke out but she still hates conservatives.
GUTFELD: She once called me a very filthy name.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You know, Adam you've coached high school wrestling, or you tell people that when you are caught in the locker rooms at the local gyms.
HUNTER: I coach a middle school team in the Palisades, and actually the Palisades, I started the school, a high school team at Palisades, and it burned down.
GUTFELD: Really?
HUNTER: Yes, yes. And while the school was burning I was trying to make the coach feel better, and I was like, well, at least you can't lose any more home matches.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That's probably true.
HUNTER: It's true, 100 percent true. But no, as a coach, it's hard enough to get boys to wrestle boys and boys to girls to wrestle girls. When you start doing the -- we have a kid that has the worst ADHD. He goes out and gets pinned in 10 seconds. He walks off the mat, and he's like, coach, who won?
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: And I'm like -- I was like, not your parents.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: And I was like, why couldn't you get off your back? He was like, I identify as a turtle.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: But here's the deal. I think that trans people just need their own sports league. That will solve everything. And they should make it fun, like have the California Cutoffs.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: Or the Milwaukee Man Hands, the Alabama Adam's Apples.
GUTFELD: I love cutoffs. Remember when you used to make cutoffs as a kid out of jeans.
TIMPF: That's what you did?
GUTFELD: Yes, that's what I did. That's what I got from that. Is this fair, do you think it's fair, whatever this is?
TIMPF: I'm not exactly sure what you're referencing, but I can take it from here.
GUTFELD: Stripping Thomas's record?
TIMPF: I feel like, it's one thing to respect people, OK. This is not zero sum when you're talking about sports, right? And I feel like there are many people who have issue with this that it's not an issue that they have with trans people. It's an issue with, OK, there are scientific studies showing that going through male puberty gives you an advantage over biological women for this reason, this reason, this reason, this reason. And I don't think it's controversial to discuss that. And I think it's a nuanced issue overall when you're talking about gender overall, not this.
When it comes to this, most people do feel this way. And it's because it doesn't have to color your view of an entire community of people. That's what the science shows.
GUTFELD: I hadn't thought about this in a while, but Erin, you did remind me of all the crap that the other players were going through. If they wanted to have that conversation --
PERRINE: They couldn't.
GUTFELD: -- they couldn't, and they would just say, no, you've got to shut up.
TIMPF: It doesn't help anybody, including trans people. It didn't help anybody to not be able to have those conversations.
GUTFELD: Charles, did I ever talk to you about this? I can't remember.
PAYNE: I think I started. I'm not sure.
GUTFELD: No, no, did you talk about this. Wow. I'm losing my mind tonight.
TIMPF: Are you OK?
GUTFELD: I had a long day.
All right, coming up, Google's shift from the DEI grift.
Yes, my brain is like fried.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five more more words.

(APPLAUSE) GUTFELD: Google finally says screw DEI. Adam, I go to you first, for no apparent reason. Google is the latest huge tech company to ditch DEI hiring targets, and the company is reviewing its DEI program. And this is just four short years after they committed to boost diversity by 30 percent this year. What say you?
HUNTER: I just think, I think DEI started as a good idea, and then it went, ran amok. Because it has to be across the whole board. And you can't do that. Even in basketball, the game ends in a tie, the team with the most white players would have to win. But that was not bad, again.
GUTFELD: I'm not even sure I understood it.
HUNTER: OK, so, I just think Trump put every DEI worker on paid leave, so now they all have the same color, a pink slip. But I actually like Elon Musk, his whole thing, like how he did it. He actually put on his bio Twitter, he put White House tech support, which is the first time ever a white guy has ever taken an I.T. job from an Indian.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: But I was in India recently and I called tech support, and a guy from the U.S. picked up.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
PAYNE: Did you understand him?
GUTFELD: Charles, is this just the pendulum going to keep swinging the other way? Because I know that Costco is still clinging to it, right?
PAYNE: There are a group of companies that are saying, hey, we're going to cling to it. And Costco's stock closed at an all time high today. You know what, it's hard to beat Costco. But it was such a farce. The whole thing is a farce, but it was really a farce in Silicon Valley. They're like, listen, you can't -- this thing backfired on every level possible. You just simply can't give people a job that they are not prepared for. And they're not going to be prepared for it unless they start from kindergarten. If we really are serious in this country, it's all about education. It's all about a commitment to learning, a commitment to knowledge and rewarding success.
And as soon as you start giving people things they didn't earn, you discourage people from wanting to do it, and you encourage people from ever putting in the elbow grease. And it was never going to work. It never worked in Silicon Valley. They tried things like this even before it had a name. But you just can't give someone a job that they're not prepared for.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: I hope that's not DEI clapping.
(LAUGHTER)
PAYNE: Just the E, just the E.
GUTFELD: Just the E. But it's something that a lot of people don't talk about is that when you give somebody a job they are not prepared for, they're going to fail. And this happened with affirmative action college. Some people went to colleges and they couldn't keep up.
TIMPF: In general the fact that these programs don't work is something people don't talk about every often in a discussion. They talk about if you're against DEI that means that you are against diversity, which how boring have all these companies made diversity? It should be exciting to meet people who are different and you learn new things about people who are different from you, and you get to know each other. But only when they make it so clinical and corporate, they actually made something that should be exciting and interesting boring and at times prohibitive.
GUTFELD: I'm trying to think how you could broaden diversity, then. Should it be also criminals?
TIMPF: What it should do is encourage open eyes conversation. A lot of the stuff did the opposite of that.
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. What do you say, Erin?
PERRINE: I think it's great that now Google is going to be hiring people based on merit and not on quotas. I think that that's the same logical, business-oriented thing they should be doing. Like you're saying, the pendulum is swinging back. It seems that sanity is taking hold again in the United States.
PAYNE: But the thing is they weren't hiring anybody anyway. That's why they gave it up. They just couldn't. We want to give this guy a job, but --
PERRINE: If they ever get the opportunity to hire again, I hope it's the person who is best qualified for the job and not a person that they feel is meeting a quota.
(APPLAUSE)
PAYNE: And hopefully it won't be the cheapest person that they import from a different country, because a lot of Americans have been chipped out of jobs in Silicon Valley, also, who are qualified.
HUNTER: I actually Googled DEI, and it said enough.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Do they have DEI in comedy? They should.
HUNTER: They should. But it's about filling seats. It's about who -- it's not even about most laughs. It's about who can draw the most people.
GUTFELD: Meritocracy at its best, and I think I summed it all up with that calm, relaxing --
PAYNE: There's a reason you're number one.
GUTFELD: Yes, that is true.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: OK, OK, you'll be back, Charles.
Up next, on Penny you can rely as he rocks a suit and tie.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, hell yes!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Tonight in "Hell yes," Daniel Penny has a hot new job. The marine subway hero landed a position at the Manhattan office of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz less than two months --
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: -- after being -- less than two months after being acquitted in the death of Jordan Neely. And for that, we should say hell, yes. Let's just hope he doesn't choke.
(BOOS)
GUTFELD: They're turning on me. They are turning on me, Charles. That is not the way you treat the host.
PAYNE: Very fickle crowd. Very fickle crowd.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Yes, thank you, thank you, thank you. Charles, why didn't FOX hire him?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Why didn't FOX Business hire him and give him an hour?
PAYNE: I don't know. We've got to talk to someone over there. I'm still not sure what he's going to be doing at Andreessen, but 29 years ago this month Marc Andreessen posed on the cover of "Time" magazine without any shoes on.
GUTFELD: Really?
PAYNE: Yes, so I just think he's one of these real people, and he's starting to come out of his shell.
GUTFELD: Marc Andreessen is a brilliant guy.
PAYNE: He is brilliant.
GUTFELD: He blocked me on Twitter, I don't know why.
PAYNE: The crazy thing is, he follows me.
GUTFELD: He follows you and he blocked me?
PAYNE: Yes.
GUTFELD: He's racist.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But he is amazing. He's one of those guys from Silicon Valley who threw his weight behind Trump. And Erin, hiring Daniel Penny is amazing. This is a guy that went through hell, charged with murder for stepping up and protecting people on a subway. And the message that that was sending to anybody else who would do something like that is not good. But this counters that message.
PERRINE: Yes, this is great vindication for Daniel Penny. I would've been very happy to have Daniel Penny on that subway car with me because I can only imagine how terrifying that was. That is not to diminish the loss of life. Nobody wanted to see that individual die. Let's be clear. But now he was a victim of a prosecution that should not have happened. The police agreed with that. The people that were on the train agreed with that. And now he's getting a chance at a new job, and if I was working at that firm, I would be very excited to have somebody who is going to bring in a different perspective. More veterans should be getting hired in different firms like this because having served in the military gives you a different perspective to bring into this. This is actually a good idea for more venture capital firms to do, is to bring in more veterans to their businesses.
(APPLAUSE)
PAYNE: No more ruckus in the lunch room, I can tell you that. No one is starting any -- in the lunch room. Here comes Daniel. OK.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You don't cut in line getting your dessert there, do you, Adam? Should they be hiring more hot vigilantes?
HUNTER: I think as far as finance, he'll be good with the money. I don't know if he'll know when to let it go.
(BOOS)
GUTFELD: They can't all be winners.
HUNTER: Come on, you can't go on the subway threatening to murder everybody. You've got to save that for the bus.
(LAUGHTER)
HUNTER: And I heard for lunch he's getting a subway hero.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I wish Penny was here right now to choke you out.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: So Kat, do you think this would have happened if Kamala Harris was president? You like how it did that?
TIMPF: I don't know how that makes sense in this context. Probably?
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: But I think what Daniel Penny seems to want is to just be a normal dude.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: I don't think he wants to be a rightwing celebrity they way many might have expected him to want. I think a lot of people expected him to be headlining Turning Point USA and start a podcast with Kyle Rittenhouse. But it seems like he just wants to be a dude with a job who goes to work and does a good job at his job. And good on you for that.
GUTFELD: He still takes the subway.
TIMPF: Yes, that's what I mean.
GUTFELD: I guess the odds of that happening twice are slim.
(LAUGHTER)
PERRINE: In New York?
GUTFELD: Well, in New York, you're right. You could have that happen twice a week.
PERRINE: A crazy person on the subway in New York, you could have it twice in one day.
GUTFELD: You can get mugged on the way home from getting mugged.
PAYNE: By the same person.
GUTFELD: Yes, by the same person.
(LAUGHTER)
PAYNE: It's easier the second time, though, you already had practice. You don't have to hit me in the head this time.
GUTFELD: Why didn't you take the watch the first time?
Don't go away. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Charles Payne, Erin Perrine, Adam Hunter, Kat Timpf, studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT with dreamy Trace Gallagher is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
