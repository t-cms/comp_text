Federal agencies are scrapping diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in response to President Trump's executive order - and the intelligence community (IC) is no exception.
Trump issued an executive order on day one of his presidency  DEI programs in the federal government. Federal agencies have since begun rolling back DEI, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA).
“CIA is complying with the Executive Order,” an agency spokesperson told the Caller.
“We are laser-focused on our foreign intelligence mission. We are complying with the EO and [Office of Personnel Management] Implementing Guidance. CIA sent out a notice on 31 January stating that Agency Resource Groups (ARGs), Directorate Resource Groups (DRGs), and Workforce Partner Groups have been disbanded.”
A CIA page on Diversity and Inclusion now goes to a . According to an  page of the site, ARGs are groups composed of “employees and allies who share a common affinity.” 
The Caller has learned there were groups for African American, Asian American, and LGBT officers.
The CIA boasted in 2019 that it was nominated by a company review site, Glassdoor, as one of the “Amazing Companies That Champion #LGBTQ Equality.” In the thread, the CIA noted it had an ARG known as the Agency Network for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Officers & Allies ( with “hundreds of members.”
 We're proud to be featured as one of 's picks for, “Amazing Companies That Champion  Equality.”

The CIA's now deleted the Diversity and Inclusion page previously  to a 2024 to 2027 CIA Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Strategy, which the Caller learned is no longer in effect. The strategy does not  on the agency's site.
The Caller has also learned the CIA is removing some DEI-themed material from its website, both internal and external.
The FBI, which axed its DEI Office in  told the Caller it is “fully complying” with Trump's executive order and that diversity is no longer listed as a “Core Value.”
“The FBI is fully complying with the Executive Order regarding DEI programs and implementation guidance provided by the Office of Personnel Management,” the bureau told the Caller in a statement.
“As a result, Diversity has been removed from the FBI's list of organizational Core Values. Visual and informational materials promoting Diversity as a Core Value are being removed from FBI space.”
In 2024, current and former agents and analysts  the bureau had relaxed its hiring standards. The officials alleged in a report that DEI was being prioritized in the hiring process, resulting in lower standards.
After the New Year's , the New Orleans Field Office received backlash for its history of promoting DEI. For instance, a press release from May 2024  plans for a “Diversity Agent Recruitment (DAR) event” to help the department find diverse applicants.

“The removal of non-record visual and informational materials regarding the FBI's Core Values is indicative of a need to update these materials and in no way violates our lawful records retention obligations under the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA),” the FBI told the Caller.
“Furthermore, while Diversity is no longer an organizational Core Value for our employees, the FBI continues its work to serve and protect all America,” the bureau continued.
The FBI and CIA are not the only members of the IC that have responded to Trump's executive order.
A National Security Agency (NSA) spokesperson previously  to the Caller that the agency used “DEI and Gender Ideology keywords” to review content on its website in response to Trump's executive order.
An agency spokesperson reiterated Thursday the NSA is working to ensure it's complying with the order.
“NSA has taken steps to ensure we are in full compliance with the Administration's Executive Order regarding DEI functions and activities,” an NSA spokesperson said. “As we receive additional guidance, we are working to ensure NSA programs, activities, policies, and guidance are updated to reflect White House policy.” 
Trump's Director of National Intelligence,  has slammed identity politics in the past.
“One of the main reasons I left today's [Democratic] Party is [because] of their obsession with race, sexuality and other externals instead of merit,” she stated in 2022. “America is the greatest country in world because it's a meritocracy. If we become a society based on externals, America's excellence will be history.”
