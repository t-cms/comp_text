 is failing egg-centric Americans. 
Like many voters, I am a breakfast-oriented ovo-voter, meaning I cast my presidential ballot for whoever I think will bring down the price of eggs. We ovo-voters had our . , so we voted for Donald Trump, a convicted felon, because we figured he’d strong-arm the chicken cartel. 
Boy, was that a mistake. On Tuesday we learned the restaurant chain . That means the special-order 12-egg-and-sausage scramble I have each morning before heading to work at the defibrillator factory will cost an extra $6.00!!
Trump told me the cost of my eggs would go down, not up!

 that said: “Consumers and restaurants are being forced to make difficult decisions. Rather than increasing prices across the menu, this is a temporary targeted surcharge tied to the unprecedented rise in egg prices.”
Excuse me, but I specifically voted for lower egg prices, not for an “unprecedented rise in egg prices.”
Is bird flu to blame for the egg prices? Nah, it's gotta be the president.
The , and The Associated Press reported: “Bird flu is forcing farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, pushing U.S. egg prices to more than double their cost in the summer of 2023. And it appears there may be no relief in sight with Easter approaching.”
Opinion: 
Blah, blah, blah. If I cared about the “reason” egg prices are high, I wouldn’t have previously  and then voted for the Republican presidential nominee. 
I only care about not having to go to Waffle House and pay extra for my.
And now that Trump is in office, you know what I’m having to do when I got to Waffle House? I’M HAVING TO PAY EXTRA FOR MY BACON, EGG AND CHEESE HASHBROWN BOWL!!!
Opinion: 
Trump seems to be doing everything except trying to lower egg prices
And what is the president I entrusted to oversee the egg economy doing while consumers like me face some form of Waffle House egg tariff?

Well, he appears to be focusing on removing  from government websites and .
I care about yolk, not woke. And unless those government employees are going to enter the private sector as large-scale chicken farmers or start laying eggs, I don’t care about the buyouts, either.
I'm an egg-price voter, and I demand fast results
It seems that bird flu is causing egg prices to soar, and if  of the people who put Trump in office, maybe he should be focusing on dealing with the bird flu crisis. 
Instead, he’s focused on letting an unelected billionaire like  with his band of non-egg-producing minions and making sure nobody ever says the word “gender.”

Trump can dismantle the federal government and push America toward fascism and line his pockets all he wants. As long as I’m not having to pay more for eggs at Waffle House.
That’s pretty much what I said with my vote in November, and I’d be a real hypocrite if I changed that view now.
