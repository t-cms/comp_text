LISTEN: Welcome to MAGAland, our podcast on the latest inside the White House
President Donald Trump has fired the female leader of the US Coast Guard over concerns about the border and her obsession with DEI policies. 
Adm. Linda Fagan, commandant of the Coast Guard, was relieved of her duties by Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Benjamine Huffman, Fox News reported.
The 61-year was terminated from her post after officials in the new administration raised concerns over the border and her recruitment, a source told the outlet.
The source said these concerns also included a failure to address key threats, and an excessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
Fagan's diversity, equity and inclusion recruitment had worsened issues relating to operational readiness, according to the source.
They said that due to her making DEI policies a priority, which included at the Coast Guard Academy, focus was diverted away from resources and operational essentials.
Fagan was also relieved over the mishandling of Operation Fouled Anchor, an investigation into the Coast Guard's review of sexual assault cases at their academy.
The report uncovered years of sexual assaults and misconduct at the academy from the late 1980s through until 2006. 
Dozens of allegations of sexual assault at the academy in Connecticut were swept under the rug without being reported to police or Coast Guard investigators. 
The report was completed in January 2020, but was not disclosed to Congress or made public until June 2023, infuriating congressional members.
She was grilled by senators when she testified at a hearing on Capitol Hill where she was questioned for not holding anyone accountable for the cover-up.
Senators also quizzed her over the withholding of documents that they had requested about the mishandling of the problem. 
A memorandum released by Fagan she said that had ordered plans to be developed by 2025 around sexual assault prevention and response.
She also ordered improved physical security throughout the cadet dormitory at the academy.
After her firing was made known, clips emerged of her on social media discussing her recruitment policies. 
In one, she says: 'We currently have nearly 40 percent women enrolled at the Coast Guard Academy. 
'I'm really excited about the talent and diversity I see coming through the academy, I am really excited about the future as we look ahead.' 
Fagan was nominated for her position by President Biden in 2022, after having served as vice commandment since 2021. 
In her former post she was named the first female four-star admiral in Coast Guard history. 
Both Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee had backed her appointment at the time. 
Fagan graduated from the Coast Guard Academy and received a masters at the University of Washington in marine affairs as well as in national security strategy from the National Defense University.
She had served aboard the USCGC Polar Star and as deputy director of operations at US Northern Command.
She was the first recipient of the Coast Guard's Gold Ancient Trident, an award created in 2016 for the service member with the longest record in Marine Safety.
