The following information was released by the office of Texas Rep. Chip Roy:
Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21) re-introduced The Restoring Military Focus Act today. This bill would permanently eliminate the Chief Diversity Officer and Senior Advisors for Diversity and Inclusion positions at the Department of Defense, which were established under Section 913 of the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
Congressman Roy said the following about this legislation:
"For far too long, radical progressive Democrats under the Biden Administration have been allowed to turn our military into a social experiment. I am thankful that President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have taken decisive action to restore the focus of the Pentagon and rid the Department of the radical DEI agenda. However, it is imperative that Republicans in Congress take action to make these changes permanent to ensure that no future Administration can indoctrinate our men and women in uniform with this divisive ideology."
The Restoring Military Focus Act will repeal fully 10 USC 147 and permanently:
Eliminate the position of Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer.
Eliminate the Senior Advisor for Diversity and Inclusion.
Prohibit the use of federal funds to re-establish these positions again in the future.
Cosponsors of the The Restoring Military Focus Act include Reps. Daniel Webster (FL-11), Ralph Norman (SC-05), Andy Ogles (TN-05), and Lauren Boebert (CO-04).
