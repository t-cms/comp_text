Vice President Vance said in an interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” with Margaret Brennan that prices will start coming down, but it might not happen immediately.
“Prices are going to come down, but it’s going to take a little bit of time,” Vance told Brennan in an interview that aired Sunday. “The president has been president for all of five days. I think that in those five days, he’s accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years.”
“It’s been an incredible breakneck pace of activity. We’re going to work with Congress. We’re of course going to have more executive orders,” he said.
Brennan noted that President Trump and Vance campaigned on lowering grocery prices for Americans. Asked which of the executive orders that Trump signed when taking office addresses prices, Vance said several “have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices.”
“More capital investment, more job creation in our economy, is one of the things that’s going to drive down prices for all consumers, but also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things that they need,” he continued.
Addressing energy prices, Vance said, will also help bring down everyday costs.
“Donald Trump has already taken multiple executive actions that are going to lower energy prices, and I do believe that means consumers are going to see lower prices at the pump and at the grocery store, but it’s going to take a little bit of time,” he said. “Rome wasn’t built in a day.”
Trump  when entering office this past week, addressing issues related to immigration to gender and DEI policy to the TikTok ban. He also reversed 78 Biden executive actions, many of which addressed initiatives to tackle climate change.
