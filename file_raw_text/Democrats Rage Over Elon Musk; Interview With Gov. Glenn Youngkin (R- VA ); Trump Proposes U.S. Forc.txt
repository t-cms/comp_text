(APPLAUSE)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Independent Women's Forum, it's a fantastic group of people that fought very hard on this issue. I think everybody in this room really fought very hard on this issue.
Kim Fletcher. You know Kim.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: Debbie -- Debbie -- I think Debbie is here.
Crew Lydis (ph), Crew Lydis (ph) from also Moms of America.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: And Penny Nance, of course, CEO of the Concerned Women for America. That is a lot of people. Thank you very much, Penny. Good job you do. That's a lot of people.
Can I give you -- here, why don't you hold that? You can sell it tonight.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: So, just to finish up, I'm directing the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who, by the way, is doing a fantastic job.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: In fact, he just left Panama. We're trying to take back to Panama Canal. Little things like that. It will happen.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: But Marco is going to make clear to the International Olympic Committee is there and he's going to make it as clear as anybody can make it that America categorically rejects transgender lunacy. We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject, that we even have to talk about this subject.
If you went back 10 years or 15 years and you would move forward and listen to this, you would say, what the hell are they talking about? This is impossible. But you have people out there, Democrats, that are still totally in favor. They can't win the argument. They can't win a debate. They look like fools and they continue to go on.
And it's OK because, as long as they do this and open borders and all of the other things they talk about, transgender everything, all they want to do is transgender and men playing in women's sports and all of these crazy things, and if they continue, I think we're going to end up ultimately -- it's not going to matter because we're never going to go along with them, and we're just going to keep winning elections, right, Mike?
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: So, when the Olympics comes to Los Angeles -- I was responsible for getting the Olympics.
And I said, oh, boy, this is terrible because I got the Olympics and I won't be president and then what happened is that an election, strange things happened in that election, so I missed four years and now I have the Olympics. So, it was sort of circuitous. It was a circuitous situation.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And we also have the World Cup coming, which is going to be fantastic. And we have, as you know, very importantly, 250 years coming. That's a big one next year, so that's a very big one.
But in Los Angeles, in 2028, my administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes and we're just not going to let it happen and it's going to end and it's ending right now and nobody's going to be able to do a damn thing about it, because, when I speak, we speak with authority.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: And for the same reason, just to make sure, I'm also directing our secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, who's also doing out -- she's out there with you, Greg -- a fantastic job. She's unbelievable.
I was watching her riding yesterday on a horse. She was as good as anybody. She's very good. To deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes, try to get into the Games, maybe where they are unable to get into the Games.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: We're honored to be joined today by many incredible advocates for women's sports, including the brave swimmer at the forefront of this battle. And Riley Gaines is a person that I have been watching.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: She's fought hard. Riley was a 12-time all-American. Well, that's pretty good, 12-time all-American, who sacrificed countless hours in the pool just for a chance at the title. It's so important to her. She gave up everything and gave -- and just gave everything she had.
But then the league forced her to share a spot on the podium with a male swimmer who took her trophy, while the media celebrated this stolen glory. And Riley is just a tremendous athlete and it was a very unfair situation. I watched it. A lot of people watched it. It was ridiculous, frankly. But I want to thank Riley.
She really has been in the forefront. People that aren't that well-versed in this would say that she was the leader.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And great job, Riley. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And also with us is another great champion for women, Payton McNabb.
In high school, Payton was a rock star athlete.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Where is Payton? Where is -- I like Payton. Nice to see you. Good job. Good job. Looks like a good athlete to me.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: In high school, Payton was a rock star athlete preparing for a future in college sports, but in one volleyball match a much taller and stronger male spiked the ball right in her face, knocking her unconscious, partially paralyzing her right side and leaving her with a traumatic brain injury.
And Payton said: "It was 100 percent avoidable if only my rights as a female athlete had been more important than a man's feelings." And we can't let it happen. And it's not going to happen.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: It's not going to happen anymore, Payton. It's not going to happen. Are you OK? Are you good?
PAYTON MCNABB, ATHLETE: I'm doing all better.
TRUMP: Good. That's good. Thank you.
We're also pleased to be joined by many incredible leaders on this issue and, as I mentioned before, Speaker Mike Johnson, and he has been so strong on this issue, because he's a man of common sense. I mean, it really is. It's common sense more than anything else.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: So, Mike, thank you. Great job. Great job in everything. He's got the easiest job of any politician in history.
He's got the nicest, like, 200 and almost 20. It sort of varies between -- depends on how many people I take for my administration. It goes up and down a little bit, but I promise I won't take any more. I just wanted to see how good he was. I was testing you.
We have some great people, but he's filling them up rapidly. He had some big wins the other day, very big wins the other day. But you have done a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Mike. We appreciate it. We all appreciate it.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And also the dozens of members of the House and Senate and governors, we -- attorney generals, so many people, and the people outside that can't even get in this room. It's packed.
And I offered to build a ballroom. I'm very good at building ballrooms. I build beautiful ballrooms. And I actually offered to build a ballroom for the White House. I was going to build it right there. This was going to be the reception room. And then I was going to build a beautiful, beautiful ballroom like I have at Mar-a-Lago, as beautiful as it can be. It was going to cost about $100 million.
I offered to do it. And I never heard back.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: I offered this. I offered to do it to the Biden administration, very active administration. They didn't -- didn't hear back. And I said again and again, three, four times, I said to top people.
And they just didn't know what to do. They sort of said, this is good, but they had no idea. So I'm going to try and make the offer to myself, you know?
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: Because we could use a bigger room, right, Marsha (ph)?
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: We could use a bigger room. President, would you like to build? Yes, I would. We could use at the White House -- it's -- it would actually be a beautiful addition.
Going to cost nothing. I will spend the whole thing myself. We will a big, beautiful room, but we could use it at the White House. You know what they do when they have a big ceremony? Put up a tent. And somehow I think we have outgrown the tent stuff, right, don't you think? So we will see if they can -- we will see if Trump will approve it.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: But the actions we're taking today are the latest in a sweeping effort to reclaim our culture and our laws from the radical left crusade against biological reality.
On day one, I made it official and I'm making it official policy of the United States government that there is two genders. We have two genders. What might they be? Man and woman, right? Male and female.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Male and female. Can't think of too many others, but it's pretty amazing.
I rescinded federal funds too, and this is so important, to any program that promotes transgender ideology using taxpayer dollars. We're not going to do it. We're not going to do it.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And, last week, I effectively banned the chemical castration and surgical mutilation of minor children.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: Can you believe I even have to say that? I banned -- Governor, I banned -- that's just like, who would ever think we have to even say that? Last week I, banned.
Every day, we're ending the extremism of the last four years. We have other things that are just as ridiculous, not having to do with the subject, but just as ridiculous, open borders, where people are allowed to pour in from all over the world from jails and prisons and mental institutions and insane asylums, people that are very sick, people that are very evil, killers, murderers.
Many of them murdered more than one person. And we have to justify the fact that we're moving them out. We are moving them out in tremendous numbers. Tom Homan and Kristi doing a fantastic job, but -- and the governor and other governors too.
But we're -- that we have to even fight for this stuff is just incredible. And the media doesn't want to talk about it because it's nothing they can talk about. It's just they just don't want to really talk very much about it, serious problem, but we're doing a great job.
But the people understand. And that's why we won in a landslide, you know? It's -- they made it easy. And at some point we have to hope they do come around because we can never let this happen again, what's happened to our country. We can never let this happen again.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: So we are restoring sanity and common sense very simply to our government. We're defending the rights and safety and pride of the American people, including our great, great, great female athletes.
What athletes you are to, I will tell you.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And I'm not allowed to say this politically. It could end my career. They're really beautiful people. These are beautiful people.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: But, like everything else, it's a little bit different today. You're not allowed to say that, because if you call a woman or a girl beautiful, that's the end of your career, but let's take a chance on it, Michael. Let's take a chance.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: So I'm going to -- I want to thank everybody for being here. It's fantastic. And this is sort of a big, big day. It shouldn't have even been necessary to take place.
It started a long time ago and we ended it today. And I'm going to sign the executive order right now, and everything I said will go into effect immediately. OK?
(CHEERING)
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: If you would like to gather around me, I think I...
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Come on.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: Secret Service is worried about them? If we have to worry about them, we have big problems. OK.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Watch what I do. Then I'm going to give you some pens, OK?
You ready? What a nice picture this is, huh, Governor? You ready? We will do a good job. Wait. Let me press that.
I want to make this a really good signature, because this is a big one, right? Oh, I think we have a 10. We have a 10.
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: Pretty good huh? OK? Good. Now you're going to go out and win those events, right? Nice to see you all. Nice to meet you. Great going everybody.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Thank you, kids. Here. Take a pen.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.
TRUMP: I will give some of these out OK? Take the pen. Take the pen.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you so much.
TRUMP: Where's Riley?
(CHEERING)
WILL CAIN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Live from the heartland, this is "The Will Cain Show."
And that was President Trump signing an executive order banning men from participating in women's sports there in front of a packed room of female athletes. And what has often been described as a revolution of common sense today is a victory in the battle for women's sports, but I think more importantly also a victory on the path to sanity.
The president cited several examples of biological men beating women in sports over the past couple of years. And, today, the president declared that the war on women's sports is over. One of the people in the room was Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. He's going to be joining us here just shortly on "The Will Cain Show."
But now we move to the other big story today. And that's the sound bite from President Trump heard around the world.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too. We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. We will do a real job, do something different.
Just can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 years.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: President Trump meeting the world's most intractable problem with one of the most out-of-the-box solutions.
That brings me to today's "Big Three." I hope you will forgive me for a moment as I sound this out loud with you. I woke up to this morning to that sound bite as President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat before the world. And I wondered, what expert would I like to hear from? I wondered, what would be my first take?
And I thought to myself, I don't know any other way to do this, but to sound it out loud with you,to reason together. Honestly, at first take, I hated this idea. It's the world's most intractable problem, an absolute mess for the better part of a century. It's cost untold number of lives and not just blood, but treasure for the entire world.
It has been something completely unsolvable for presidency after presidency and nation after nation in the Middle East. But then, on the other hand, I thought, why doubt Donald Trump? Donald Trump has brought out-of-the-box solutions to some of the most intractable problems in two weeks in the United States of America.
Why freak out? Have we learned nothing from art of the deal? Is he simply sticking out a negotiating position for all vested parties to eventually find some satisfiable solution?
That seemed to be one of the suggestions today by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt as she addressed this issue in the Middle East.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza. He has also said that the United States is not going to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. His administration is going to work with our partners in the region to reconstruct this region.
And let me just take a step back here, because this is an out-of-the-box idea. That's who President Trump is. That's why the American people elected him. And his goal is lasting peace in the Middle East for all people in the region.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: In 1980, U.S. Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks had a problem on his hands. He had a U.S. Olympic hockey team made up of guys from half Michigan, half the Northeast. They hated each other. They fought in training camp. They didn't get along when they competed.
So what was Herb Brooks' strategy? His strategy was to make them all hate him. And then they would come together as a common team with a common goal, a common purpose, to defeat the Soviet Union. And they did in the famous Miracle on ice.
Maybe this is President Trump's strategy, to be the man in the room that everyone must negotiate against, bringing parties that hated each other together for once.
But then part of me thought, why do we have to be the world's bad guy? The other side of me once again said, don't be naive. We have always been involved in the Middle East. We have always been involved in this negotiation. And we have more often than not been the bad guy. Recognize reality. Seek a solution.
I still wondered, how does this serve America first? How does this serve the people of America? And yet, in the end, as our defense secretary said famously today, Pete Hegseth, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again.
We might as well look at one of the world's longest problems and bring in a leader who thinks outside the box, whose crazy may just be crazy genius.
Now, to continue thinking about this together, I brought in some experts to discuss this incredible moment.
George Birnbaum is a former chief of staff to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. David (sic) Hoffman is a former CIA station chief. He served in Moscow, Iraq, and Pakistan. He's a FOX News contributor. And most of the audience knows my friend, your friend Joey Jones, former Marine EOD, and often someone who sat beside me on the couch at "FOX & Friends."
All right guys, I want to get into this.
Let me get -- I will start with you Mr. Birnbaum first, your first reaction. What do you make of this moment, this idea that the U.S. would take ownership in the future of Gaza?
GEORGE BIRNBAUM, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Well, as you stated in your opening monologue, it is an out-of- the-box idea, and it does require out-of-the-box thinking to solve not just a decades-old problem, but a centuries-old problem.
For most of the past 500 years, Gaza was ruled either by the Ottomans or the British or the Egyptians. And only after 1967 did the Egyptians allow the Palestinians to settle there as refugees. And if we look at what's happened over the past year, Gaza is pretty much inhabitable.
Even from an infrastructure standpoint, you -- all your viewers I'm sure saw the Israeli Defense Forces blowing up the terror tunnels that Hamas had built with cement and iron that was meant to build houses and schools and hospitals, but instead they built terror tunnels. You can't build on top of that right now.
This is an enormous reconstruction project.
CAIN: Right.
BIRNBAUM: And in order to do that, we need out-of-the-box thinking. We were told in 2005, when Ariel Sharon pulled the Israeli settlements out of Gaza, that Gaza would become the Singapore of the Middle East.
Well, it became another hub for terror in the Middle East.
CAIN: Right.
BIRNBAUM: And so the only way to really change the trajectory of Gaza of the past 500 years is to start with something unique and new. And I think President Trump has got the entire world thinking in a new and unique way.
CAIN: Joey, I woke up this morning. I saw many of your posts on X. You, of course, know the price of a long and unanswerable entanglement for the United States of America. You have seen it personally, obviously, in Iraq and Afghanistan.
You, my friend, you have paid the price. And you were worried this morning, I saw, that future Americans would pay the price for something far away like Gaza. You did hear Karoline Leavitt, though, no boots on the ground, at least at this point, nothing committed in Gaza.
SGT. JOEY JONES (RET.), FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Israel's a unique situation, because there are so many United States citizens that are dual citizens or citizens that live there. A lot of times, I think Americans have trouble understanding why it's their problem, our problem.
And President Trump campaigned on that message. The Middle East problem isn't our problem. The problems around the world aren't our problems to fix. But then you have Israel, and it's treated differently. I don't think it's a double standard. I think people don't take the time to understand why it's differently.
But at the end of the day, when the president of the United States stands there and says that the unexploded bombs and weapons, we will take full responsibility for, brother, that means that I'm going to -- a guy like me, that did what I did is going to go over there and take IEDs apart. I'm not for that at all.
My intuition, my belief is that this is a part of his chess, and this is his way of getting places like maybe Saudi Arabia or Jordan to say, no, no, no, you can't have this. Let us do it. Maybe it is that simple.
But I'm a hypocrite if I don't stand up and say, hey, wait just a minute. I just voted for you because you said we wouldn't get involved with more wars. So I have got one -- much like you, Will, I got one side of me saying I voted for this guy because he will scare the hell out of our enemies and say things that are hyperbole and then have a strategy behind that's different.
CAIN: Right.
JONES: And the other side of me says, no matter who that person is, when they're the leader of the free world and they're talking about sending my guys and gals to war or to take apart bombs, I got to say something.
CAIN: You know, Dan, to that point -- and, Joey, I appreciate that answer by the way, because I came onto the show today and I woke up this morning thinking, I can't pretend expertise on this. And I actually don't believe there is much expertise in this.
JONES: Yes.
CAIN: And I respect, Dan, what you have done for a living. I also think most experts when it comes to Israel and Gaza or the West Bank have been wrong for half-a-century in trying to find a solution.
And so why should I keep leaning back on experts who have told me this would be crazy? I woke up to that, Dan. This is crazy, right, in response to Donald Trump. Are we all taking crazy pills? But I'm hearing that, Dan, from people who never got it right for 50 years. They didn't solve it. So why do we dismiss this as a potential solution?
DAN HOFFMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I covered President Trump's summits with Kim Jong-un. And this is a little reminiscent of when the president discussed with Kim Jong-un how he could turn North Korea into the same economic powerhouse if the hermit kingdom were opened up to the rest of the world.
That's just kind of the way President Trump thinks. Now, look, the biggest obstacle right now are the thousands of Hamas fighters in Gaza. If U.S. -- if the United States were to send our troops into Gaza, we'd be involved in an armed conflict there. There's no chance at the moment for post-conflict reconstruction, but it's worth talking about it.
And what I think the president was doing yesterday is, he's trying to kind of shape the narrative for how we're going to discuss the post-conflict reconstruction. He's talking about what we would like it to see look like. We know we need to engage our allies in the region, specifically Egypt, Jordan and our Gulf partners, as well as Israel.
CAIN: Right.
HOFFMAN: It's a complicated, messy kaleidoscope. But, look, it's a discussion point, and that's what this president does.
CAIN: So, Dan, you laid out sort of the phases of this. Phase one is to eradicate Hamas. Phase two is to figure out what to do with the Palestinians in the short term. Phase three is what Donald Trump perhaps is talking about now, the long-term future of Gaza.
So, Mr. Birnbaum, back to you, on the Palestinians. I don't want to dismiss this, OK, because the interested parties we talk about in the region -- and, for now, we will focus in on Egypt and Jordan, OK? That's the suggestion of where they would go. They don't want the Palestinians. They have made that very clear.
And the reason for that is, they consider it an existential threat to their kingdoms, be it in Egypt or the kingdom of Jordan. Now, I recognize that President Trump plans to talk to them in the coming weeks. But for them, they worry about the Palestinians upending their power into the future for, say, in Jordan.
BIRNBAUM: Yes, well, let's first remember that it requires a change in paradigm to really move things forward.
We were told, basically since 1967, that until we solve the Palestinian problem, Israel will not be able to make peace with its Arab neighbors. Donald Trump, in his first presidency, came along. Abraham Accords changed the paradigm. We can, in fact, have peace with our Arab neighbors prior to solving the Palestinian solution.
CAIN: Right.
BIRNBAUM: Now, let's also remember that Jordan is 60 percent Palestinian in terms of their population. It's not as if they're not going to be taking a population that doesn't already exist within their country.
I certainly believe that Donald Trump has the ability to think out of the box and find a way to get these two countries to see things differently that benefit both their own countries, but the broader Middle East as well, as he did with the initial Abraham Accord negotiations when it came to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and other neighbors.
CAIN: Right. Yes, again, I don't think we should be in the business of doubting Donald Trump based -- that's not sycophancy, and that's not partisanship. That's being able to read the past. That's being able to read the room.
And so I mentioned it earlier, I'm going to play this for you, Joey, our former -- our current and always future friend, but our former co-host, Pete Hegseth, now the secretary of defense. He said this, as I mentioned, the definition of insanity. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETE HEGSETH, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: I would just say to the question of Gaza, the definition of insanity is attempting to do the same thing over and over and over again.
And as the president and prime minister pointed out last night, the president is willing to think outside the box, look for new and unique, dynamic ways to solve problems that have felt like they're intractable. So we look forward to more conversations about that, creative solutions to that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: While I'm short on time, Joey, I will leave it to you. We're both struggling with both sides of this debate. What do you think about what we hear from the secretary of defense?
JONES: Yes, after hearing Karoline talk today and Pete talk today and the president talk again, I think this is the president saying, oh, if in the middle doesn't work for you, let me pull it all the way to the other side. And now let's see where you are. If you can't live peacefully, then we will just take it. And then maybe now there's a renewed energy to live peacefully and get others involved like Egypt or Jordan.
I think that is the endgame. But if you had a United States-owned Gaza, that would be the largest target for terrorism in the world. And I'm not there for that.
CAIN: I mean it when I say this conversation could and should probably go on for another half-hour.
I appreciate your time, all of you. It's thoughtful. And I hope we can continue it. Dan, George, Joey, thank you.
BIRNBAUM: Thank you.
CAIN: All right.
Shrinking the swamp; 20,000 federal employees take Trump's buyout offer. And the rest got to make a decision by tomorrow, this as we learn more about USAID and how it spent some of its money.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEAVITT: Two million dollars for sex changes in Guatemala, $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt, $20 million a new "Sesame Street" show in Iraq, $4.5 million to combat disinformation in Kazakstan. I could go on and on.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAIN: The clock is ticking for federal workers to make a decision, accept a buyout or return to the office. So far, 20,000 employees have chosen to take the buyout deal.
Now, Peter Doocy's at the White House now with more.
Peter, good luck keeping up with everything on an hourly basis. That's why we have you, Peter Doocy.
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's why we have calculators on our phone, Will. And it's a lot of subtracting the last couple of days. All 20,000 employees that work for the CIA were offered a buyout, as officials here at the Trump White House try to better align the federal work force with Trump priorities and cut wasteful spending like this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEAVITT: Two million dollars for sex changes in Guatemala, $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt, $20 million a new "Sesame Street" show in Iraq, $4.5 million to combat disinformation in Kazakstan. I could go on and on.
Democrats are outraged that the American people want to be -- they want their taxpayers going to good uses, not stuff like this. But then they're very quiet about the fact that there are still North Carolinians and people in California who have lost everything.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOOCY: A big one White House officials are looking to axe is USAID. They are directing us to $1.5 million for DEI in Serbia, 70K for a DEI musical in Ireland, 32K for a trans comic book in Peru.
But Democrats still want people to fight to keep it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. EDWARD MARKEY (D-MA): There should be hundreds of thousands and millions of people descending home to Washington, D.C.
(CHEERING)
MARKEY: We need a march for freedom. We need a march for democracy. We need a march for justice, not just for people in our country, but all around the world.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOOCY: Another Democratic senator, Chris Van Hollen, went one step further. He says the people must fight in the courts and fight in the streets.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DOOCY: Are any officials here preparing to fight Democratic lawmakers in the streets?
LEAVITT: Absolutely not. If you heard that type of violent, enticing rhetoric from our side of the aisle, from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, I think there would be a lot more outrage in this room today.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOOCY: And we have been in touch with OPM this afternoon.
They're telling us that the number of federal employees taking the buyout that was offered last week is growing so rapidly, they're not going to give us an update on how many people are going to voluntarily leave until after tomorrow's deadline. But, so far, it's about 1 percent of the work force, 20,000 people.
That is far short at this point of 5 to 10 percent goal, which would be about 200,000 people -- Will.
CAIN: Well, so let me make sure I understand Ed Markey correctly. They're ready to fight in the streets to spend U.S. taxpayer dollars for the people of Colombia to be subjected to a trans opera? Just so we're clear on the priorities of the Democratic Party?
DOOCY: Just so we're clear, yes.
CAIN: OK. Thank you for that clarification, Peter.
I have two questions for you, though. I really have two serious questions for you. I want to talk about this money going to Politico. It's a big story today, $8 million from the federal government going to Politico. What we now know, I believe, Peter, is the case, it's not all coming from USAID.
It's within the federal government those employees subscribing to Politico Pro, which is absurdly expensive, Peter, thousands, tens of thousands of dollars. I would want to know two things. What do you get for that subscription? And were they subscribing to other publications like, I don't know, "National Review" or The Daily Wire? Or was this just for Politico?
DOOCY: I didn't know it was that expensive. I do not subscribe. I think there's been one time in the last couple of years that there's been something behind the Politico Pro pay wall.
But they are allegedly getting insider information. So people that work within the government are getting inside information about other things happening within the government. But Karoline Leavitt confirmed today they are going to cancel all of those subscriptions. It's worth several millions of dollars in fees to Politico.
CAIN: It's grotesque. It's at a minimum subsidizing a political operation under the guise of the media. It's perhaps money laundering to ideological compatriots.
OK, Peter, great to see you, man. Good luck. Get the calculator out. We will see you again tomorrow.
All right, you just saw President Trump taking action to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports. Somebody that was there in the audience is the governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin.
Now he's stepped away, and he's going to join us next on "The Will Cain Show."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Under the Trump administration, we will defend the proud tradition of female athletes and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls.
From now on, women's sports will be only for women.
(CHEERING)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: About 30 minutes ago, President Trump signing an executive order barring male athletes from participating in women's sports.
Now, my next guest was in the room for that signing. He is Virginia Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, and he joins us now.
Governor, last time we were together, and I'm going to see if I can remember exactly, but you told me that your career average at Rice was -- was it two points, in the range of two points, as a basketball player at Rice.
But you were sure to tell me that your career best game was against my Texas Longhorns. So the question is, if I have my stats right, did you ever consider how good you would have been if you just transitioned over to women's basketball?
GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA): I have to say, no, Will, I never thought about that.
And you know what? Today was one of those moments where the women who have been worried about that, the girls who've been worried about that no longer have to worry about it. And what is such a clear statement of common sense that biological men should not play sports with biological women was established as an executive order from the president of the United States today.
And he is saving women's sports. And I have to say, in Virginia, we are so excited. Of course, we had a Virginia Tech swimmer who missed out on the finals of her NCAA championship because she came in one below where she could have been otherwise if it had only been women competing.
And we have had women swim teams at Roanoke College who came together and said, no, we are not going to allow a biological male in our locker rooms and in the pool with us to compete.
This is a big moment for America, because women's sports are protected by Title IX. Women's sports are part of our national ethos. And now they're going to be protected. And I saw so many young girls standing on the stage today smiling because they know that they get to pour their heart into their passion and they get to compete and they get to compete against other girls.
CAIN: I love when it's dismissed as it's only a few transgender athletes. I thought this was the same people that suggested injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere.
And yet here we have, as you point out, multiple examples of women subjected to these types of injustices. And, for the record, Governor Youngkin's a hell of an athlete. And I could never, would never take him on the court. He would dunk on me and score 30. He would be Luka Doncic in the Will versus Glenn matchup.
OK, Governor, though, in that room, President Trump also brought up doing away with the DOE. He said, we might need to look at phasing it out under Linda McMahon. That would turn over power to you, to the states to have further influence and control over your education. Is that something you want in Virginia?
YOUNGKIN: Yes, we have always thought that the states are far better prepared to teach the kids, to administer the schools and to have high expectations.
And it's one of the very, very strong attributes that I brought into Virginia when I became governor was raising expectations in our schools to excellence to make sure that we are standing for those key educational values. We're holding our schools accountable through a new accountability system to make sure that our children are learning.
And, most importantly, that we allow the schools to do what they do best, which is teach children, and not have the federal government constantly tinkering and dictating how best to educate kids. I think this is a big step. I look forward to working with the White House and the new Department of Education to make sure that we're able to get the best for our children.
CAIN: Right.
YOUNGKIN: In Virginia, we came in and said, hey, first of all, parents matter. We're going to have expectations of excellence. And, finally, we're going to make sure that schools are being held accountable with transparency and delivering.
And this is exactly what we have been doing. And having a partner in the federal government is going to be incredibly helpful to deliver for Virginia students, so they can get the best education possible.
CAIN: There is no doubt you led the way on these educational issues in the state of Virginia. It's what helped bring you into the office, and you help lead the way now, culminating in what we saw today from the White House.
Governor Youngkin, always good to see you. You're always welcome here. Not welcome to see you on the basketball court.
YOUNGKIN: Great. Thank you very much. God bless you.
CAIN: All right, take care, Governor.
Democrats raging over Elon's access to the federal government.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Are you willing to fight day and night, dawn and dusk to fight Elon Musk?
REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): We will see you in the courts, in Congress, in the streets.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: But isn't this what the American people actually voted for?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): What we're not going to do is stand around while they pull this (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that they're trying to pull right now.
REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): We have got to tell Elon Musk, nobody elected your (EXPLETIVE DELETED).
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We are going to fight this fight. I am going to stand with you in this fight.
PRESSLEY: I am so tired of these billionaire boys and their grubby little hands grabbing at everything.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) damn it, shut down the city. We are at war.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is an economic coup happening right here in the Treasury.
REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): First and foremost (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Elon Musk.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wants to take our agencies apart piece by piece so that working people have no recourse.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAIN: Lot to unpack there.
Democrats melting down on Capitol Hill over Elon Musk's search for government fraud. But isn't this exactly what Americans asked for? In fact, isn't it what they voted for? They voted for DOGE.
Joining me now is a former special assistant to President Biden, Michael LaRosa.
Michael, you hear, I would, assume your compatriots, your friends, at least those people on the same side of the aisle as you hear. You hear them. Are you ready to go fight in the streets? Are you ready to grab your bullhorn and chant about Elon Musk?
MICHAEL LAROSA, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: No. Neither should they.
I mean, he's got to stop living rent-free in our minds. I mean, this is just not a fight Democrats need to have. And it's not a hill they need to die on. I'm with Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod and James Carville on this.
Look, the last thing we want to be doing -- you listed out the Democratic priorities or how you perceive the Democratic priorities right now, right? Right now, imagine those in millions of dollars of 30-second ads. The ads are being written right now for all these vulnerable Democrats in really marginal districts.
CAIN: Right.
LAROSA: And they're going to have to defend spending taxpayer money on some of those things that you listed off.
CAIN: But, Michael, it seems like you sort of made this bed and you have to lie in it. I don't begrudge you the desire for your party to change.
But when I say you made this bed, the Democratic Party has done this thing of a verbal tick that kind of goes viral. And you can remember all of them, pandemic of the unvaccinated, threat to democracy, on and on, Nazis, whatever it is, is the current sort of slur du jour, target du jour.
And now the target du jour is Elon Musk. And so you have kind of developed this habit as a party. And here we just see, well, it'll be gone in a couple of weeks. But this is your flavor of the day. You want to yell -- not you personally. The Democratic Party wants to yell about Elon Musk.
LAROSA: Yes, two weeks before the election, I noticed morning cable, some morning cable was leading on the topic of Trump being Hitler.
And I just kept thinking to myself, oh, my God, if we're talking about Hitler at 6:00 a.m. and leading the news with it, we must be losing.
(LAUGHTER)
LAROSA: I just didn't have a good feeling because it just did not seem that that is what the pulse of America was feeling.
Look, we need to move the debate. We have a two-seat deficit in the House. We have leverage. The real fight, the big fight is over government spending. They cannot keep the government running without Democratic votes. That's where we have leverage.
CAIN: Right.
LAROSA: That's where we can accept concessions.
CAIN: Just one minute left here. Well, I appreciate you don't want Hitler for breakfast. None of us want Hitler for breakfast.
It seems like you're in the wilderness, Michael, again, not you, the proverbial you. The Wall Street Journal wrote about it. You have no leader. You have no message. You're lost, bumping into trees in the wilderness.
LAROSA: Well, look, we got to be common sense. And we have to -- we keep losing the battle over the perception of common sense to the Republicans.
And it starts here. This is the kind of stuff. Look, we don't have power. Is he violating the law? Probably. This is what got him impeached in the first place, right, halting congressional aid that was appropriated. You're a lawyer. You know better.
But, look, we don't have power. This is not the hill we want to die on, right? The country does not really like foreign aid. I learned this from watching "The West Wing" in the '90s.
CAIN: Right.
LAROSA: It is not a popular subject with Main Street America, nor are federal workers. We don't want to be caught on our heels defending spending on DEI in Serbia, which is what is going to happen to these members...
CAIN: Right.
LAROSA: ... if they don't move on and start focusing on things that matter, play the long game and stop being distracted by these shiny objects.
CAIN: I ask this question one more time. I'm down to just a few seconds with you, Michael. Give me one name that you think emerges from the wilderness, common sense, could reposition your party out of the wilderness and away from the insanity, one name.
LAROSA: Well, I'm not dodging your question.
But when this happened the last time when Democrats were in the wilderness after John Kerry lost, everything changed. Nothing is frozen in politics.
CAIN: That's true.
LAROSA: Two years later, we had Republicans -- Republicans had a trifecta. Two years later, we elected Nancy Pelosi. We flipped 32 seats. And then Barack Obama appeared out of the wilderness.
I don't know who that person is, but there's a good chance we're not talking about them right now.
CAIN: I will just tell you -- and we can have a deeper conversation on this in the future -- the difference between that old maxim, which is true, no power is permanent in Washington, is, I do think Donald Trump has positioned us in a post-bipolar world.
It's not left-right.
LAROSA: Well...
CAIN: It's not Republican-Democrat. He's reshaping the nature of public debate. And that right now is why you're in the wilderness.
I have to leave it there, Michael, but we know, both of us, that's worthy of a deeper discussion, which we will have.
LAROSA: Yes.
CAIN: Thank you so much.
LAROSA: Yes.
CAIN: All right.
LAROSA: You're welcome.
CAIN: All right, it's time for "Will of the People."
Sharon says: "Hey, Will, I love your new show, but don't you dare try to steal country music from Tennessee. We are the country music capital of the USA."
That's yesterday me suggesting it comes to Texas.
James says: "Please don't do this. You have been pleading for United States to stay out of foreign conflicts and occupations forever. Now you instantly flip-flop your entire personal view and political narratives overnight? Bad, bad look, Will."
James has been a longtime fan. I would say this. No, I haven't, James. I think you need to look at a unicorn in politics like Donald Trump and think, have we learned nothing from the art of the deal?
And then, finally, Robert says: "It's Minnesota, not Michigan. Pete Hegseth will not be happy."
The Olympic hockey team was Minnesota and the Northeast. I stand corrected.
Now I give you "The Five."
