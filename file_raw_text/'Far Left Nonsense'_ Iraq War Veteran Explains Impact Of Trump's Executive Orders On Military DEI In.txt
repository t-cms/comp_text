An Iraq war veteran appeared Monday on Fox Business to talk about President Donald Trump's executive order to stop woke practices within the U.S. Armed Forces.
Trump  to sign a trio of  pertaining to the military, including one that will eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the U.S. Defense Department. Another will develop a policy regarding transgender troops. A third will reinstate service members discharged for refusing COVID-19 vaccines. During an  on “The Bottom Line,” Rob Smith discussed the immediate impacts.
“I think it's great. It's been a wild week. Look, when a lot of people talk about DEI, they get it confused. So I want to give you two examples of how the wokeness has really spread through the military,” Smith said.
Smith said there are common misconceptions about  initiatives.
“This is what President Trump's executive order has gotten rid of,” Smith said. “First of all, the U.S. Navy paid an active-duty service member that moonlights as a drag queen to act as a digital media ambassador and give performances in drag, which he did on a U.S. naval carrier. The second is a chief diversity officer that was employed by the Department of Defense that injected woke ideology into the school system that the children of our active-duty servicemen and women attend. His person was relieved of duty a couple of years back. ” 
The veteran said these incidents would get scrapped following the enforcement of Trump's executive order.
“So when we talk about the DEI and the far-left nonsense that Trump's executive order has gotten out of the military, I want to be clear that these are the very specific examples that we are talking about when it comes to the gender ideology, when it comes to the CRT [Critical Race Theory] stuff,” Smith said. “These are two very specific examples that I think did not get enough attention when that report came out.”
Smith cited the  that came from Republican Texas Rep. Chip Roy and Secretary of State . The report said America's military is compromised by the policies of former President Joe Biden's administration. These policies, the report said, are driven by progressive ideologies that undermine national defense.
“The world is a dangerous place, and the Biden Administration's insanity is eroding our greatest source of security in it,” the report said.
