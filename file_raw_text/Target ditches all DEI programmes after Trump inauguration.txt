Highlight: The retail giant has been accused of embracing a ‘radical transgender agenda’
Body


Target has dropped its DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) targets just days after Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The retail giant, which has previously been accused of embracing a “radical transgender agenda”, has cut short a series of measures which included plans to promote more ethnic minorities and women.
In November, Robby Starbuck, the activist who  , told The Telegraph that Target was “on the list” of companies he planned to pressure.
Target, which has more than 400,000 employees across thousands of stores, has scrapped plans to hire and promote more women and ethnic minorities – including a goal to boost its number of black workers by 20 per cent.
Measures to recruit from more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of colour, women, LGBT people, the disabled, and veterans, have also been dropped.
It will also no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its diversity strategy actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights group.
Mr Starbuck, who said he had worked with Target executives to end “many of their woke policies”, claimed the retailer had also privately undertaken to stop marketing Pride merchandise for children.
“We are winning and one by one we will bring sanity back to corporate America,” he said in a statement on social media.
In a memo to employees on Friday, Kiera Fernandez, the retailer’s chief equity officer, hailed the “next chapter” in a decades-long process to create “inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.”
Some diversity initiatives, including a program to support black employees, shoppers and communities called Racial Equity Action and Change, had already been scheduled to conclude this year, the retail giant said.
Target has been one of the most vocal supporters of inclusion efforts among US companies, selling merchandise for events such as Pride and Black History Month.
Mr Trump, the new US President, has   within the government and American companies since taking office on Monday.
In 2023, Target faced a lawsuit from the America First Policy Institute, a think tank founded by Mr Trump’s allies, arguing that it had embraced radical activists at the expense of shareholders.
It accused the retailer of embracing a “radical transgender agenda” and caused its share value to collapse by $12 billion from May 2023 – the largest decline in two decades.
Target allegedly sold controversial items including girls’ swimsuits with “extra crotch coverage” for male genitalia, and “Satanist-inspired” clothing that showed pictures of skulls alongside slogans that included “transphobe collector” and “homophobe headrest”.
In November, Walmart, the biggest private employer in the US, became the latest company to say it would phase out terms like “diversity, equity and inclusion” in company materials.
Mr Starbuck said he had had “productive conversations” with Walmart executives about the decisions after he warned the retailer that he was “doing a story on wokeness there”.
Target said in a statement: “We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion. 
“Belonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results.
“In every area of our business, we are constantly listening, learning and adjusting to set ourselves up for long-term success.”
