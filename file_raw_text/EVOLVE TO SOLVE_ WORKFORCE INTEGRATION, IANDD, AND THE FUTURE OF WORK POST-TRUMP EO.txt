To explore the evolving policy landscape and what it means for your organization, watch SHRM's on-demand webinar, "Gender and Inclusion: Navigating New DEI Executive Orders."
The world of work is shifting rapidly, with workforce participation, demographics, and the size of industries all changing. Women now make up nearly half of the U.S. workforce and are the most educated group in the labor market. Yet they are not matriculating into leadership at the same rate as men. SHRM research finds that over 70% of HR professionals say women face labor market discrimination. With a shrinking labor force, addressing this issue is no longer just a matter of fairnessit's a strategic business imperative.
To remain competitive and address growing talent shortages, businesses must maximize the potential of their entire workforce. With new executive orders reshaping workplace policiesand news that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering the investigation of "illegal" private-sector inclusion and diversity (IandD) initiatives under Attorney General Pam Bondinow is the time to take strategic action. Companies must reassess IandD initiatives to ensure they drive collective success while maintaining fairness and compliance.
From Representation to Business Results
The conversation around gender in leadership is evolving, specifically as it pertains to men and women in the workplace. Traditional IandD initiatives have largely focused on increasing representation, promoting individual advancement, and overcoming barriers. While these efforts have created opportunities, they haven't fundamentally changed the leadership pipeline or workforce outcomes.
Despite women being the most educated group in the U.S. labor market, their career advancement continues to be outpaced by men's advancement. McKinsey and Company's Women in the Workplace 2024 report highlights persistent gaps across the corporate ladder. Women are less likely to be hired into entry-level roles, creating a disadvantage from the start. For every 100 men promoted to managerial positions, only 81 women advancehindering the leadership pipeline and creating challenges for companies to sustain inclusion at the senior level.
The reality is that workplace structuresnot just individual effortsmust change for IandD efforts to have a lasting impact. Workforce inclusion is no longer just about fairnessit's about results.
The goal is no longer just to help individual women break barriers, but to redesign workplaces to eliminate barriers altogether. Rather than expecting individuals to navigate inequitable systems, businesses must assess current initiatives to eliminate obstacles to inclusion, strengthen the pipeline, and drive meaningful workforce outcomes.
To drive real impact, the focus must shift toward collective success, workforce optimization, and solutions to real-world business challenges. This evolution is critical to aligning IandD strategies with business imperatives. By reframing IandD as a workforce strategy, companies ensure their efforts are sustainable and impactful.
The Business Case for Workforce Integration
Business success is directly linked to talent optimization. Organizations that maximize all available talent poolsmen and women alikeare better positioned to drive innovation, competitiveness, and financial performance.
With labor participation declining, birth rates falling, and talent shortages increasing, optimizing all available talent will be essential to fill critical roles. Organizations that fail to tap into the full potential of their workforce will face hiring challenges, stagnated growth, and decreased competitiveness.
Advancing women in the workplace isn't about favoritismit's about fairness and business results. Yet many companies hesitate to take action and advance underrepresented groups due to fears of backlash or perceptions of preferential treatment.
Workforce integration aims to foster a balanced, fair, and productive work environment for all employees, where they can collaborate, contribute, and thrive on an equal footing, free from discrimination or bias.
Workforce integration should be inclusive, not exclusive, ensuring that development opportunities are available to allwhile recognizing unique challenges that different groups face. To build truly inclusive workplaces, leaders must move beyond the perceived risk and focus on the measurable benefits of inclusion and diversity.
A Legal and Strategic Imperative
Considering the recent shifts under the Trump administration's recent executive orders and DOJ memos, organizations must find a balance between legal compliance and strategic workforce initiatives.
Talent development programs should not exclude men, but should account for disparities that exist. A "same but different" approach is necessary, in which eligibility for workplace policies and development programs is equal, but application is tailored to address gender-specific workplace barriers.
For example:
Parental Leave: Both men and women may be eligible for paid parental leave, but women often receive longer durations due to childbirth-related medical needs.
FMLA Leave: The eligibility is the same, but utilization differs based on individual circumstances.
Talent Development Programs: While some training should be open to all, targeted programs for women can help address industry-specific disparities, much like tailored programs exist for veterans, students, or other underrepresented groups.
The key is ensuring fairness, not favoritism. By offering growth opportunities that meet distinct needs, businesses enable all employees to contribute meaningfully to success.
Amid a shifting workplace policy landscape, this is more than a legal requirementit's a strategic imperative. Businesses must evaluate their IandD initiatives to ensure compliance and support long-term growth.
Applying BEAM to IandD Programs
To help businesses effectively navigate the complexities of balancing fairness and workforce optimization while maintaining legal compliance, SHRM offers a practical solution.
SHRM's Belonging Enhanced by Access through Merit (BEAM) Framework provides a structured approach to ensure that leadership and workforce development programs are inclusive, legally sound, and aligned with business goals. Organizations should assess their programs against these five critical BEAM questions:
Anti-Exclusion: Are the program's opportunities open to all without regard to an individual's sex, race, or any other protected status?
Access for All: Does the program generate opportunities to participate based on an individual's requisite merit, including their existing skills and proficiencies?
Merit-Driven: Does the program select individuals to participate based on relevant qualifications while accommodating protected medical conditions and religious practices?
Unbiased and Available Information: Is the availability of the program effectively communicated to all individuals so that participation is truly open to all?
Skills-First Optimization: Does the program provide opportunities to develop relevant skills, qualifications, and experience for all individuals eligible to participate?
Applying BEAM ensures that inclusion programs are structured to drive business impact while remaining legally defensible.
Inclusive, Not Exclusive: A Modern Approach
When addressing workforce inequities, a one-size-fits-all model falls short. Instead, organizations must adopt an inclusive yet customized approachwhere leadership development programs create space for targeted interventions while still promoting integration.
For example, at Linkage events, all participants attend keynotes together, but breakouts are tailored for different audiences, including women, men, military personnel, and studentsensuring that everyone's unique challenges and opportunities are addressed.
Leadership's Path Forward
The post-Trump EO landscape requires organizations to rethink how they approach gender inclusion in the workplace. The goal is not to create exclusionary programs but to evolve to solveensuring that every employee has access to the resources, training, and opportunities they need to thrive.
By aligning IandD efforts with business outcomes, applying the BEAM Framework, and fostering an inclusivenot exclusiveapproach, organizations can build workplaces that truly optimize talent for long-term success.
