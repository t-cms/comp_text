Good morning.
Donald Trump has  , DeepSeek, as a “wake-up call” for the American tech industry after it . 
Investors questioned the US artificial intelligence boom after the Chinese tool appeared to offer a comparable service to ChatGPT with far fewer resources. Nvidia, a leading maker of the computer chips that power AI models, saw its shares collapse by 17%, which works out to the single largest fall in absolute dollar value in US stock market history.
“The release of DeepSeek, AI from a Chinese company, should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,” said Trump. The DeepSeek assistant surpassed ChatGPT in downloads from Apple’s app store on Monday.
                                                                                        How has OpenAI, which made ChatGPT, responded? CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek “impressive” but said the US industry would speed up development.                                                                                          What are some differences between the chatbots? DeepSeek appears to censor answers to sensitive questions about China and its government: see what happened when the Guardian .                                                                                 Trump condemned over ‘blatantly illegal’ firings of watchdogs                                      
The independent   have condemned the sudden development as illegal, warning that it threatens democracy and opens the door to unchecked institutional corruption.
The firing of the 18 inspectors general from federal agencies last Friday, including the departments of defence, energy and state, has been widely criticized. Hannibal “Mike” Ware, the inspector general for the Small Business Administration until he was dismissed without warning, told MSNBC that the firings are anti-democratic because they violate a law requiring the president to give Congress 30 days’ notice and the rationale for dismissal.
                                                                                        What are the concerns for their replacements? The roles are meant to be independent and non-political, but there are fears that Trump will appoint “political lackeys”, said former interior department inspector general Mark Greenblatt.                                                                                Trump ends DEI in US military and reinstates unvaccinated troops                                      
Trump signed a   that remove diversity, equity and inclusion policies from the US military, and reinstate thousands of troops who were removed for refusing Covid vaccines.
One of the orders, which says it aims to eliminate “gender radicalism in the military”, appeared to be aimed at transgender soldiers. In his first term Trump froze the recruitment of trans troops, while allowing serving personnel to remain in post; the move was reversed under Joe Biden.
The developments came on Pete Hegseth’s first full day as defense secretary, after he narrowly secured enough Senate votes to be confirmed in the post. During his remarks to reporters as he entered the Pentagon, Hegseth referred to the names of Confederate generals that were once used for two key military bases.
                                                                                        When were unvaccinated troops dismissed? Thousands were fired from the military after the Pentagon made the Covid vaccine mandatory in 2021.
