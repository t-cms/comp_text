PODCAST: Listen to Welcome to MAGAland for the latest insider Trump news & gossip
A woke teacher ranted about Donald Trump's rollbacks on transgender and DEI programs during a Washington State House of Representatives committee hearing.
Tracy Castro-Gill, 49, the former leader of the Seattle Public School District's Ethnic Studies program, took the podium at a House Committee on Education public hearing on Thursday to complain about Trump's measures.
'My name is Dr. Tracy Castro-Gill, my pronouns are they/them. I am a disabled queer Chicanx educator and scholar in Washington state with my expertise on curriculum and instruction,' Castro-Gill said in her long-winded tirade.
'These were markers that were made illegal recently in the federal government. However, my very presence and humanity is in opposition to that legislation.
'I want to remind us that George Orwell, in his novel 1984, warned us about limiting how we are allowed to define ourselves and our experiences and how that allows fascism to take root.'
On his first day back in office, Trump signed executive orders repealing protections for transgender people and terminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government.
The president made the issue of gender part of his campaign, arguing that it fell into the realm of common sense. 
'As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,' Trump said during his inaugural address last week. 
The chairwoman, Democratic Representative Sharon Tomiko Santos, interrupted Castro-Gill's rant to remind the teacher to stay on topic with the hearing of HB 1296.
The bill aims to promote a safe and supportive school system by addressing student rights, parental/guardian rights, employee protections, and requirements for state and local school districts,' according to The Center Square.
Castro-Gill said they would support the bill if amended with additional teacher protections.
'The fact that teachers have stood in the gap and are the primary targets are why I am testifying pro because of the protections for educators,' the teacher said.
'Educators, as we've heard from students, are often the people who foster student identity and development and are currently being targeted and pushed out of their positions because of this fact.'
Castro-Gill called out Republican Rep. Joel McEntire during their rant for questioning if the bill was in line with Trump's orders.
'I also teach at the University of Washington and hear the curriculum violence and harm and how they're being erased in their K-12 programs, much the way that I and other gender expansive people were erased by Representative McEntire in this very room today,' the teacher said.
Santos reprimanded Castro-Gill again, saying, 'Excuse me, ma'am, we don't impugn members. Please proceed carefully.'
Castro-Gill wrapped up the rant by demanding stronger protections for educators and including language in the cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion standards from the state professional educators standards board and ethnic studies framework from the superintendent's office.
Castro-Gill once led the Seattle Public School District's Ethnic Studies program from 2019 to 2020 and was paid $93,000 a year.
However, Castro-Gill was removed from the district in 2020 for the program's failure and repeated incidents in the school, and the position was dissolved. 
They accused colleagues of being racist and introduced an Ethic Math Studies program that claimed math could be used as a tool for racism.
Their father, Rick Castro, who is half Hispanic, said his child lied about being homeless as a child and compared them to race faker Rachel Dolezal.
Castro-Gill has denied the allegations and called their father an 'ultra-conservative conspiracy theorist' who has been out of their life for years. 
Daily Wire reporter Luke Rosiak wrote a piece on Castro-Gill in 2022 that exposed they were married to a convicted child molester.
According to Rosiak, Castro-Gill left their husband, Ron Hammond, and two children in California to move to Washington and marry Brian Gill, a convicted child molester who had abused his eight-year-old cousin.
The two had met online on the SecondLife virtual chat website, where strangers could talk to one another using online avatars. Brian had died of a heart attack in 2018.
