The Trump administration has directed that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) employees be placed on paid leave by Wednesday evening.
In a Tuesday memo, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) directed heads of departments and agencies to place staff on leave and to remove all websites and social media accounts related to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility by Wednesday at 5 p.m.
A  was first obtained by CBS News and later  by the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
Charles Ezell, OPM’s acting director, also instructed the heads to send an agency-wide notice of the closure and ask the staff about any known efforts to disguise similar programs.
The move follows President Trump’s Monday executive order entitled “.”
The move is an apparent effort to repeal President Biden’s executive order to remove potential workforce barriers for the outlined demographic in 2021. 
Federal agencies and departments must report on all steps taken to comply with what is outlined in the memorandum by Thursday and provide a complete list of DEIA employees as of November 2024.
Heads are also asked to submit a written plan to fulfill Trump’s decree by Jan. 31.
“Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law, and we are going to bring law and order back to our cities,” Trump said during his inaugural speech.
“This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based,” he added.
