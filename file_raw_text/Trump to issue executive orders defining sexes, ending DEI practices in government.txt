President-elect Trump intends to  on his first day in office that will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and aim to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the federal government, according to incoming White House officials.
The order aims to direct agencies to enforce laws to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes, according to the officials, and not enforce laws as if sex includes gender identity. It will also direct the secretaries of State and Homeland Security to ensure official government documents such as passports and visas reflect male and female.
It will also prevent agencies from promoting the concept of gender transition, and agencies will only list male or female when asking about sex. The order also intends to stop federal funds from promoting gender identity. The Trump administration also intends to recognize that women are identified as having the reproductive cell, as opposed to identifying women through a chromosome.

Additionally, the order will aim to protect privacy in intimate spaces, especially women’s prisons, migrant shelters and rape shelters, and it will make sure taxpayer funds are not being used for transition services in prisons.
The order will direct the attorney general to ask agencies to ensure workers in the federal government are provided Title 7, which is part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits employment discrimination based on race, sex and other areas.
Another order expected to be signed Monday will focus on DEI initiatives, aiming to end those programs on the federal government level.
The order will ask the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management to coordinate with agencies to terminate what it deems as “all discriminatory programs” in the agencies, according to the incoming White House officials.
The order will also direct the assistant to the president for domestic policy to have monthly meetings with deputy secretaries to assess DEI programs and figure out ways to end them.
The incoming officials indicated private businesses should “wait and see” about the programs, because more actions on DEI are coming “very soon.”
