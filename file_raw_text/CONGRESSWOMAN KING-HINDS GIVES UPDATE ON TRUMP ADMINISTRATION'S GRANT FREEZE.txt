The following information was released by the office of Northern Mariana Islands Rep. Kimberlyn King-Hinds :
Today, Congresswoman Kimberlyn King-Hinds announced which federal grant assistance programs for the CNMI will be affected by the temporary freeze on federal financial assistance programs issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
"I know many in the CNMI have been worried after the OMB announced it was freezing federal assistance," said Congresswoman King-Hinds. "I want to thank everyone for being patient while I sought answers to your questions as to what exactly was affected by the grant freeze. It has been my priority to find the answers to how this impacts our community."
According to the OMB, financial assistance freeze will not affect any program that provides direct benefits to individuals such as:
Social Security
Medicare
Medicaid
Section 8 Housing
Pell Grants and student aid
Food stamps
Aid to small businesses and farmers
The financial assistance freeze will affect those that come into conflict with President Trump's previously signed executive orders, which are:
Protecting the American People Against Invasion
Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid
Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements
Unleashing American Energy
Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing
Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government
Enforcing the Hyde Amendment
The administration is using the temporary pause to review programs and efficiently allocate funds to programs deemed in line with the President's priorities. Although the OMB has not stated how long the process of re-examining programs and agencies will take, they are working quickly to determine which programs are inconsistent with the President's Executive Orders. They say they could complete the process in as little as one day.
