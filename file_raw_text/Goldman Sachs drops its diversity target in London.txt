GOLDMAN Sachs has dropped a target to have black bankers make up 7pc of its London workforce following Donald Trump's crusade against diversity policies.
The Wall Street bank has axed a slew of diversity targets including having black people make up 7pc of its workforce in the Americas and UK and having women holding 40pc of its vice-president roles.
Goldman employs more than 3,000 people in the UK, the majority of them in London. It has smaller offices in Birmingham and Milton Keynes.
David Solomon, Goldman's chief executive, said the bank had "made certain adjustments to reflect developments in the law in the US".
It comes after President Trump banned federal contractors from engaging in "illegal DEI" programmes, putting lucrative government contracts at risk for those which fail to comply.
A number of US banks have abandoned their diversity and inclusion policies in the wake of the president's executive order. Mr Trump has railed against DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - calling such schemes "illegal and immoral discrimination programmes".
Separately, British drugmaker GSK said it was watering down diversity targets linked to executive bonuses. The company said in its annual report the inclusion component of its scorecard for annual bonuses was being lowered. It means inclusion will no longer be measured on a standalone basis.
