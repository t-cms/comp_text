Media Tip Sheet: Trump Administration Moves to Dismantle Federal DEI Programs and End Affirmative Action in Contracting
Trump's administration has begun dismantling federal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, placing DEI staff on leave and rescinding Biden-era initiatives aimed at combating systemic bias.
A new executive order eliminates affirmative action in federal contracting, revokes protections for marginalized groups, and mandates a government-wide review of grants and programs that prioritize diversity.
Faculty experts at the George Washington University are available to offer insight, analysis and commentary on the impact of disbanding DEI programs. If you would like to speak with an expert, please contact the GW Media Relations team at
