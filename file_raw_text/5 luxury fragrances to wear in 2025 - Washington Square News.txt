5 luxury fragrances to wear in 2025
New semester, new scent.
Rizaa Fazal, Contributing Writer
February 19, 2025
A signature fragrance is the ultimate accessory - one that stays with people long after you have left the room. For 2025, let's leave behind generic, chemical-like scents and embrace perfumes with rich undertones that truly stand out. So if you're still looking for a New Year's resolution, find your signature scent with these five scent-sational fragrances in their smallest sizes. 
Jazz Club
by Replica | $35, 10 mL
If there was a cologne that captured its name perfectly, this would be it. With notes of tobacco and rum, this scent is perfect for bar regulars and the artists who love a spirited vibe. While this fragrance is primarily marketed towards men, the masculine fragrance is beautifully balanced with the vibrant aroma of pink pepper, making this the perfect fragrance for anyone who is looking for a rich and sophisticated option.
Vanilla 28
by Kayali | $32, 10 mL
Vanilla 28 may be best known as Love Island star Leah Kateb's signature scent. The fragrance's undertones of vanilla and amber is just code for pure sugar, making it an unmistakable perfume, even from a mile away. Whenever I catch a whiff of someone on the street wearing this scent, I am instantly hit with the image of warm cookies. If you decide to make this perfume yours, make sure to keep the fragrance in a dark place until it ages into a dark brownish-purple color to really let the sugary scent melt into something irresistible on your skin.
Salt Eau De Parfum
by Ellis Brooklyn | $33, 10 mL 
Salt is the ultimate "clean girl" fragrance. A masterful blend of woody and floral undertones, the fragrance from New York City-based brand Ellis Brooklyn is versatile and can effortlessly transition from beachy summer days to cozy fall afternoons. With subtle notes of cashmere, this perfume is perfect for people who want to give the essence of a warm, cozy hug. But before you commit and spritz, this is a scent to definitely test out before purchasing a full-size bottle. Perfumes react differently on each person, and some say that Salt can leave a mildew scent on their skin.
Libre Eau De Parfum
by Yves Saint Laurent | $36, 10 mL
The coolest part of this fragrance? Dua Lipa is the face of it. This luxurious fragrance, which blends the floral essence of lavender and the warmth of vanilla bourbon, is said to deliver the same wow factor as Baccarat Rouge 540 for a fraction of its price. With additional undertones of orange blossom and musk accords, Libre isn't overly sweet as you might expect, containing a hint of spice that is perfect for those who want to add a twist to their feminine scents. 
Nectarine Blossom & Honey Cologne
by Jo Malone | $27.87, 9 mL
For those who are searching for a fun, fruity and floral scent that isn't too overbearing, this is the one. It is one of the few fragrances that made me feel like I wasn't just smelling but actually tasting a juicy bite of a fresh, sweet clementine. Although very feminine and floral, this fragrance is very soft and has underlying tones of freshness. The only downside is that this fragrance has a tendency to fade quickly, so you need to reapply it throughout the day to keep that citrusy scent fresh.
