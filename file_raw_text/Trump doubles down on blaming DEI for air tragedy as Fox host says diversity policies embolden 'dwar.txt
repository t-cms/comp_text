North America braces for new Trump tariffs as Saturday deadline nears
12:15
,
Alexander Butler
Companies, consumers and farmers across North America braced on Friday for U.S. President Donald Trump to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports within hours, moves that could disrupt nearly $1.6 trillion in annual trade.
Trump has set a Saturday deadline to impose the punitive duties over his demands that Canada and Mexico take stronger action to halt the flow of illegal immigrants and the deadly opioid fentanyl and precursor chemicals into the U.S.
Trump said on Thursday he still is considering an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports to punish Beijing for its part.
Industry groups were furiously seeking any scrap of information on how Trump plans to implement the tariffs -- whether he would impose the full 25 per cent with immediate effect, or announce them and delay their implementation to allow some time for negotiations over steps that the countries could take.
Even immediate imposition would require two to three weeks of public notice before U.S. Customs and Border Protection could begin collections, based on past tariff actions.
Wall St gears up for fallout from likely tariffs on Canada and Mexico

Alexander Butler
Global policymakers and Wall Street analysts have been bracing for massive trade barriers from the new Trump administration. 
But it focused more on the domestic front in the first week in power, leaving the global trade landscape largely unchanged.
President Donald Trump's tariff threats range from universal levy on imported goods to ones tailor-made for specific sectors as well as countries, and have the potential to dictate the path of inflation, economic growth and stock market performance.
He has plans to impose 25 per cent tariff on Mexico and Canada, largest trade partners of the U.S., on 1 February, saying they may be necessary as retaliation for migration and fentanyl trafficking.
Canada mainly exports crude oil and other energy products along with cars and car parts as part of the North American auto manufacturing chain. Mexico exports various goods in the industrial and auto sectors.

Trump doubles down on baseless DEI claims

Alexander Butler
US president Donald Trump has doubled down on his baseless claim that diversity hiring could be to blame for a tragic plane crash that killed dozens of people.
Trump ordered a review of all federal aviation hiring and safety decisions after Wednesday night's deadly air collision near Washington that killed 67 people, Axios reported.
Footage of the horror crash showed a Black Hawk military helicopter collide with an American Airlines jet before exploding into a massive fireball.
As a massive search-and-rescue operation for survivors was underway, Trump refused to visit the site and blamed DEI policies and Joe Biden for the disaster.
He falsely claimed the US's federal aviation regulator encouraged the hiring of those with "complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability and dwarfism".

A military deportation flight to Guatemala ordered by Donald Trump likely cost at least $4,675 per migrant, according to data provided by US and Guatemalan officials.

It is also significantly higher than the cost of a commercial charter flight by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Judge deliberating on trans prisoner's lawsuit against Trump gender executive order

Alex Woodward
The hearing in the trans prisoner's lawsuit targeting Trump's gender executive order is over. The judge is now mulling whether to issue a temporary restraining order. There is no timeline for a decision.
Meanwhile, a brand new separate lawsuit was just filed in Washington, D.C. by another group of incarcerated trans women who are similarly trying to block Trump's order.
They all risk losing access to their healthcare and being forced into men's prisons.
Plaintiffs are at imminent risk of losing access to the medical care they each need to treat their gender dysphoria. [Trump's executive order] singles out transgender people to deny them essential healthcare, including medications that [the Bureau of Prisons] may continue to provide to non-transgender people. The Order categorically bans transgender healthcare regardless of medical necessity. It prohibits prison medical providers from treating transgender patients' gender dysphoria on an individual basis according to independent medical judgment. This blanket ban will deprive Plaintiffs of essential treatment, putting them at high risk of serious harm.

Here's our earlier coverage of the impact of the order:

Trump admin fights back at funding freeze restraining order

Alex Woodward
Acting Assistant US Attorney General Brett Shumate comes out swinging against a temporary restraining order on Trump's funding freeze.
He argues that the whole thing is moot after OMB yanked the memo yesterday. But even if OMB didn't, Shumate claims that the plaintiffs in this case (a coalition of nonprofit aid groups) can't trace the impacts of losing funds to the memo itself.
Shumate also argues that "the Government is allowed to choose what activities to fund without being subjected to heightened scrutiny" and "temporary pauses in funding are commonplace and accepted by the Legislative Branch."
Sounds like they're teeing up for a longer legal battle over the constitutionality of the appropriations clause and Congress's power of the purse.

California Sen. Adam Schiff urged his colleagues "to think about where we are in this moment."
"We have a new president. He's fired prosecutors who investigated him. He's investigating other prosecutors or his Department of Justice has fired inspector generals who might hold him accountable, and this is just the start," he added. "And as FBI Director nominee, he's chosen someone whose primary qualification, in my view, is his willingness to say yes when everyone else would say no to whatever the President wanted to say, whatever he wanted to do. That's why he is sitting here."
"I mean, look at the people who held that job before Mr. Patel, the stature of the people that held that job, the qualifications of the people that held that job," he continued. "And how could any of us think that his background, his qualifications, hold a candle to the people who went before him?"
"How did we get here, where we are defending a nominee like this, who makes songs with convicts who attack law enforcement?" Schiff asked. "How did we get here, and where are we going? History is littered with democracies that lost their freedoms and didn't notice it while it was happening. Let's not be one of them."
