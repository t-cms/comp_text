Rep. Roy, Greene introduce legislation to permanently abolish USAID
February 7, 2025
Press Release
WASHINGTON -- Reps. Chip Roy (TX-21) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) introduced legislation on Friday to permanently abolish the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) -- thereby ending decades of wasteful and corrupt federal spending.
The two-page bill would immediately halt all taxpayer funding to USAID upon passage, and would simultaneously claw back any USAID grant funds not already sent out.
Congressman Roy said the following about this legislation:
"I am very proud to work with Rep. MTG and co-lead this legislative effort to permanently eliminate USAID. I am pleased that the rot and corruption is finally getting the attention and action it deserves from the Trump administration, but Congress needs to back this effort up and end this problem permanently. With $36 trillion in debt, we have to get our fiscal House in order; but we can start right now with getting rid of USAID."
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said the following about this legislation:
"Thank you to Chip Roy co-leading our bill to abolish USAID, the Democrats' taxpayer-funded slush fund used to push their radical agenda at home and abroad.
As Chairwoman of the DOGE Subcommittee, I've launched the War on Waste--and USAID is a major culprit lighting over $40 BILLION on fire each year.
It's time to do what DOGE does best: cut the waste.
Thank you to Chip and our 13 original co-sponsors for joining me in the fight to end waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government."
Cosponsors of the legislation include Reps. Eli Crane (AZ-01), Andy Ogles (TN-05), Ralph Norman (SC-05), Brandon Gill (TX-26), Diana Harshbarger (TN-01), Josh Brecheen (OK-02), Eric Burlison (MO-07), Scott Perry (PA-10), Greg Steube (FL-17), Thomas Massie (KY-04), Lauren Boebert (CO-04), William Timmons (SC-04).
Recent examples of wasteful USAID spending include (link is external) :
* $1.5 million to "advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities"
* $70,000 for production of a "DEI musical" in Ireland
* $2.5 million for electric vehicles for Vietnam
* $47,000 for a "transgender opera" in Colombia
* $32,000 for a "transgender comic book" in Peru
* $2 million for sex changes and "LGBT activism" in Guatemala
* $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt
* Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a non-profit linked to designated terrorist organizations -- even AFTER an inspector general launched an investigation
* Millions to EcoHealth Alliance -- which was involved in research at the Wuhan lab
* "Hundreds of thousands of meals that went to al Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria"
* Funding to print "personalized" contraceptives birth control devices in developing countries
* Hundreds of millions of dollars to fund "irrigation canals, farming equipment, and even fertilizer used to support the unprecedented poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan," benefiting the Taliban
