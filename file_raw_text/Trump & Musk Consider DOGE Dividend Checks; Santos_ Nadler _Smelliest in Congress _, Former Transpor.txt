SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: -- being with us. Thank you for making the show possible. Please say in DVR so you never ever, ever, ever miss an episode of Hannity. News anytime, every time, all the time. Foxnews.com, Hannity.com.
And in the meantime, let not your heart be troubled, Greg Gutfeld is coming up next, and he will put a smile right there on your face. It'd be great. Have a great night.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Oh, yeah. Oh, I didn't see you there. Let me put my fan mail away.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Happy Thursday, everyone. So according to ex-Congressman George Santos, Jerry Nadler has the worst body odor in Congress.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Nadler denied the charge saying, that's not my body. It's my pants.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: DOGE head Elon Musk says he's considering giving 78 million Americans $5,000 per household. Half of these households will be benefiting from a DOGE dividend. The other half are just his child support.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Got a lot of kids. A statue of a woman believed to be more than 2,000 years old was found in Greece. I think we have a picture of the sculpture.
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Yeah. The Trump administration is ordering the Pentagon to plan for sweeping budget cuts. Great. Now who's going to do the sweeping?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You're cutting their sweeping budget?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: No. If you don't like it, it's OK. But it makes you wonder if they shrink the Pentagon, won't they have to change the name to the quadrilateral?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I don't care. A judge is sentencing people who shoplift at Walmart to wash cars in the store's parking lot. Will that be two coats of wax, ass one man?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes. Yeah. Usually, he just waxes his balls.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Why did I say that? How would I know? L.A. Mayor Karen Bass says she's investigating the decision she made to head to Ghana Days before the L.A. fires. She also wants doctors to open her brain to find out why she's so (BEEP) stupid.
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Delta is reporting offering passengers on the Toronto flight that flipped upside down during landing $30,000. Here's the first passenger accepting the money.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Researchers say that flushing a public toilet releases a cloud of airborne bacteria that can reach deep into your lungs. I know. Crazy. I mean, who has ever actually flushed the public toilet?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: And finally, Whoopi Goldberg says DOGE should cut funding to SpaceX because the government already has NASA. By that logic, we should also cut "The View" since we already have Animal Planet.
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: All right. Thank you. Let's do some stuff. So we all know the story of Robin Hood, stole from the rich, gave to the poor. He and his band of merry men hung out in the woods eating apples and wearing tights. It was just like that summer I spent hiking with RFK.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But now another guy with a funny accent wants to do the whole Robin Hood thing right here in America. Musk is considering a DOGE dividend, tax refund check sent to Americans funded by all the money DOGE is saving us. He's giving back the money that the useless stole from everyone else, which makes me wonder if there's even under consideration a new concept where we give 20 percent of the DOGE savings to American citizens and 20 percent goes to paying down debt?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's even, under consideration a new concept where we give 20 percent of the DOGE savings to American citizens and 20 percent goes to paying down debt.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Like the sound of that. Kind of makes sense. You know? Now that we've taken back all that dough our corrupt government has been wasting, why not give it to the people who earned it in the first place? Finally, my assistant won't have to moonlight in that tire factory.
And it's not like you'd be getting something for nothing. That money was taken out of every paycheck you earned to pay for scientists studying shrimp running on treadmills, workshops for Ecuadorian drag queens, creating super viruses in foreign labs, and, of course, making animals trans.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Hell, DOGE just discovered 2 billion in taxpayer funding for a nonprofit linked to Stacey Abrams. Yeah. A nonprofit that had a $100 in revenue, mysteriously got 2 billion from us, and it arrived a month after Abrams penned an op ed endorsing Biden. Talk about a payoff. I haven't seen a bribe that obvious since Brit Hume paid me to keep quiet about his tramp stamp.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: And what has all that money done since then? Well, it didn't -- it definitely didn't go to dental work.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Unfair. True. What Trump's doing just seems right. If the government has been stealing from me to pay off all these frauds, why shouldn't we steal it back? But was that the point of DOGE? DOGE was designed to confront a debt crisis that spells doom for this country, and it got that way because the government became a piggy bank for special interest in foreign cutouts.
We also resented chipping into a leftist slush fund against our will every time we got paid. So now we wanted to be our piggy bank. So much like JB Pritzker's pants, I'm torn.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: First, I want DOGE to continue on its amazing warpath, but I realize we need proper persuasion if you want the public to continue to support it over time. And promising thousands of dollars to Americans who've been cheated for years is a hard one to beat.
I mean, the Dems are already floundering against DOGE, but DOGE plus a dividend, It'll be more popular than that mall tour I did with Menudo.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So even if it may not solve the intended problem ASAP, it might end up preserving the mission long-term. But it still nags me. We're $38 trillion in debt. How will this DOGE dividend solve that mountain of a crisis? So I guess you could say that I'm solidly, bravely on the fence.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Because we're only a month into DOGE, and honestly, it's exhausting. I feel like every morning is the day after Halloween, and I wake up every morning to a bag of candy. And before breakfast, my face is already smeared with more chocolate kisses than that time I played spin the bottle with the Harlem Globetrotters.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Oh my god. Which makes me wonder how long will the public support last when, as Trump once predicted, we grow tired of winning? Well, if there's a reward, the answer would be never.
It's basically saying, hey. You've been with us so far. Here's something that tied you along. Perhaps it's not exactly right. Right would be all the cuts go to preventing a full default on the debt, otherwise, we'll face an economic crisis that would make the depression look like a trip to Sandals with Trace Gallagher.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yum, yum. But while the dividend isn't right, it's persuasive. What we in the old days called a bribe. But in this case, the bribe isn't going to a bunch of greedy crooks. It's also not going to rich libs getting student loans canceled so they'd vote for a brain dead president. It's going to you and your family as a reward for supporting a president who's unafraid to lead.
And that's the problem with Robin Hood. He's not always right, but damn is he loved.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(ANNOUNCER: PERIOD!)
GUTFELD: Let's play tonight's guest. He has a holster for his blow driver. Co-host of "Fox and Friends", Charlie Hurt.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Blow driver. Her name is Liz and she'll give you the biz. Host of "The Evening Edit" on Fox Business, Liz MacDonald.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: He was once the head of the PTA until they found out he didn't have kids. Comedian and Host of the "Jim Norton Can't Save You" Podcast, Jim Norton.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: And her mouth was once pulled over for speeding, Co-host "Outnumber" Emily Compagno.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Charlie, as an astute political analyst and a new co-host of a very mediocre show
Here it comes.
GUTFELD: Can you do both? Can you, cut the deficit, save this economy, and give a dividend?
CHARLIE HURT, FOX AND FRIENDS WEEKEND: Oh, I think without a doubt. I mean and as you point out, it is our money. So why can't we have it back if they're wasting it on a bunch of nonsense? I think that this is the most consequential and important political fight we've had probably in a generation.
And I think that -- and one of the -- just take the politics side of it. The fact that Democrats are forced to defend all of the things that this money is being spent on is, I think, hysterical and defines them. And it genuinely defines them. And my favorite is when they talk about something's a drop in the bucket. $14 million going to Trans Sesame Street in Africa is just a drop in the bucket.
Well, for regular taxpayer, they're sitting, they are going, wait a minute. I've worked my entire life, and I have -- and I've been taxed, majorly for my entire life. And that's more than the total taxes I have paid. So all of my effort that I have put into this federal government, you're going to send for -- to Africa for Trans Sesame Street.
And that money can also be spent so much better on people in North Carolina, for example.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
HURT: And so I think that at a very --
GUTFELD: Knock, Knock Trans Sesame Street, Ernie and Bert becoming Emma and Bertha. They were a hell of a couple. Trust me. I got the video to prove it.
HURT: You would like that.
GUTFELD: Liz --
HURT: But spend your own millions on it.
GUTFELD: Yes. That that is true. I should spend it myself. Liz, this DOGE is expected to expire on 07/04/2026. I mean, is this possible that they're going to get all the work by Dan and we all get money back? It doesn't seem realistic to me. You tell me.
LIZ MACDONALD, "THE EVENING EDIT" HOST: Yeah. I think you're right. I honestly, I think they're going to keep going beyond July 2026. And, you know, to spend half our paychecks and taxes, and all this is blowing out the back door and we're not supposed to say a peep about it, when we have military veterans who are homeless, we have people in North Carolina living in tents, we have L.A. fire victims homeless now.
So what really got to me today was Democrat Jasmine Crockett saying, we're not in the business of sending back people's money when she's talking about the DOGE dividend. Wasn't she for reparations?
GUTFELD: Yes.
MACDONALD: Didn't DOGE just find out, yeah, you very much are in the business of, you know, giving out money, and blowing it out the back door. I just find it astounding that we've been talking -- all of us have been talking about this for generations, and the fact that now DOGE is finally doing it is breathtaking.
GUTFELD: It is breathtaking.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: By the way, I don't mean to offend those with asthma by saying it's breathtaking.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Jim. --
JIM NORTON, COMEDIAN: Yes, Greg.
GUTFELD: Jim, you have been an astute observer of economic policy going back since the Eisenhower administration.
NORTON: Thank you, Greg.
GUTFELD: When you look at DOGE, do you see an arena that you would like it to target like, corrupt brothels or corrupt prostitution rings or just corrupt prostitutes?
NORTON: Well, Greg, I support all three of those things. And I know that I'm not going to have to spend money to buy the African Sesame Street sets. Didn't know it was so good. Yeah. I love that they're doing it. I love they're going to give some money back.
Why not? I mean, because it's not like they're taking and they're spending it all on really worthy causes and good things, and then they're taking from them. They waste it. We have no say in where it goes, and that's why people hate the government.
If you had some faith in the fact that, like, I don't want to be 45 or 50 percent partners with the U.S. government. So if I, like, had faith in where the money was going, no one minds paying taxes to help a homeless person. No one minds --
GUTFELD: Oh, I do. But go ahead.
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: Well, I was going to say, help them out of the country, Greg.
GUTFELD: Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Help them into the loony bit.
NORTON: Exactly. Help yourself to a job, bucko.
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: But it's -- when it's the garbage that they do with it that you start to hate them. If it's worthy causes and people who are, like, you know, single mothers, like, I don't think people object to their money being spent that way.
GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, Emily, without going off topic on an unrelated 15 minute story --
(LAUGHTER)
EMILY COMPAGNO, OUTNUMBERED, CO-HOST: Are you still upset over last night?
GUTFELD: No. I'm not upset over last night. That was an amazing dessert. Please share us your thoughts on DOGE. I don't think anybody is hitting what I mean, which is, like, in 10 years, our country could be destroyed by debt. And that's what the whole point of DOGE was. It wasn't about giving us money, even though it is our money. What say you, Ms. Outnumbered?
COMPAGNO: Look, I'm no economist, but I am a taxpaying American that hates the IRS. And I agree -- I hear what you're saying, and I think that it's all separate arguments. So the most persuasive argument is that the bipartisan problem is the debt, and that the most screwed we are is the long term looming debt situation, and no amount of, like, emptying the ocean with a bucket is going to do anything about it until DOGE.
But the second point is that the political capital of actually having money in our pockets
GUTFELD: Right.
COMPAGNO: That's priceless.
GUTFELD: That's the persuasion.
COMPAGNO: Totally. And so to me, I think that ironically, the amount of the debt is so much that it's worth saving a little bit of -- you know, taking a little bit longer to get the political capital. And if you couple that with not having to pay as many taxes, like, then we ensure we make it past the midterms. We ensure that we're there for another 4 years after and then beyond.
And we also ensure that this entire system of dismantling remains in place. Because the end of the day, despite the 22 billion to Stacey Abrams and circumcisions and all the (BEEP), despite that, I worry that the dismantling can be somehow reconstructed. It takes time. Right now, we're just identifying where all of the toxic tumors lay. We're identifying how it's been untraceable and covered up and how corrupt the system is.
It's going to take a minute, not only to root it out, but to set things right again. So I think buying that time is a good investment.
GUTFELD: That is a great summation from our lawyer --
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: -- from our lawyer on the panel, Emily Compagno.
Before we go, a quick announcement. Tickets are now available for my live 2025 tour. I'll be in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Arizona, and Texas, just to name a few states. Go to Ggutfelt.com for ticket info.
Up next, the rep with the biggest belly is also the most smelly.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(ANNOUNCER: IT'S COMING YOUR WAY. HEY, HEY. IT'S VIDEO OF THE DAY.)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
GUTFELD: Thank you, God. Mirror, mirror in the stall. Who's the stinkiest one of all?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Our video of the day comes to us from former Rep. George Santos who revealed the smelliest member of congress to our political hygiene correspondent, Jim Norton.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Roll it, Axel.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NORTON: Sure.
GEORGE SANTOS, FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: No mental reservation.
NORTON: Sure.
SANTOS: The worst body odor in Congress is definitely Jerry Nadler.
NORTON: Really?
SANTOS: It's so bad. It's so bad.
NORTON: Dude, Jerry Nadler stinks.
SANTOS: Dude he stinks. Jerry Nadler would waddle down that aisle and crop dust it. Like, it was every step of his waddle was a fart. But, dude the just stinks. So bad.
NORTON: So Jerry Nadler farts, and he smells?
SANTOS: And he smells. And he's greasy and oily. I'm like, Ew. Take a shower, goddamn it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: God. I love him. So should we be shocked? It's about as surprising as finding a ham under Joy Behar's pillow.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I imagine every time Nadler farts, Washington declares a public health emergency. But who knows? Maybe George likes the guy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NORTON: Do you dislike, Nadler? I've never met him.
SANTOS: I can't stand him.
NORTON: You don't like him.
SANTOS: Did he stinks? How do you like somebody who stinks?
NORTON: I mean, that's a great point. It's very difficult to be --
SANTOS: It's very difficult to get past somebody who actually actively smells bad. Oh, god. You can't do it.
NORTON: And is it also like that BO on water?
SANTOS: It's everything. It's like -- it's the -- like, just look at him. He's always greasy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So once again, this humble show of yours breaks the stories before everyone else. Let's take a fond look back at our coverage.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Jim Comer writes that Jerry Nadler, no joke, smells like a truck stop restroom,
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Which is false. Truck stop restrooms are cleaned once a day.
Jerry Nadler was so angry, he announced that he'll no longer be giving a courtesy flush.
They stink worse than the Capitals men's room after Jerry Nadler's lunch of curry clam soup.
It's like one fart destroying the sex appeal of Jerrold Nadler.
But why does his face always have that look like he's walking behind Jerrold Nadler?
Do you ever get, like, when you're watching it, you go, I can smell Jerrold Nadler. I can smell, all of -- well, I can smell him.
He farts a lot. We hope they're farts.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Jim, excellent reporting.
NORTON: Thank you very much, guys.
GUTFELD: Exactly. On top of this --
NORTON: Yes.
GUTFELD: Were you surprised when Santos told you Nadler smelled terrible?
NORTON: Not really. No. I had originally asked him who had the worst breath in Congress, and he was a little nervous about that. He's like, ah. And then he goes, but without reservation, then he just launched into Nadler. So then he confessed that the worst breath was a Republican, so he didn't want to offend somebody who he likes. He wouldn't say the name, but I'm dying to know.
GUTFELD: It's interesting that he launched into Nadler. Usually, there are things launching out of Nadler.
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: He -- during that podcast, it's like a ninety minute conversation. He saw that James Comer's name is.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
NORTON: He saw that -- we brought that interview up, and he went -- he was so happy because he's like, I -- he said something that he smells like he actually soils his pants, like, beyond just farting.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
NORTON: And the best part is in the Daily Mail, they wrote about it. And then they said, Nadler's office has refused to comment.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Because they're holding their breath.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You can't talk when you're like this. They nodded.
NORTON: By the way, I -- George Santos -- I don't know -- President Trump does watch this show. Can he pardon George Santos?
GUTFELD: I mean, we've had -- every time that we have George Santos scheduled on this show, there was a plane crash or there was something -- we always had to bump the show.
NORTON: Yeah.
GUTFELD: Yeah. It was shame.
NORTON: Get him on. He's great, and I think the President should pardon him. I'm making an open appeal to President Trump. Pardon George Santos.
MACDONALD: Should he pardon Jerry Nadler?
GUTFELD: You know, Liz --
NORTON: Sorry.
GUTFELD: -- do you agree -- Liz, since you're already talking --
MACDONALD: Sorry.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Do you think that Santos could be a bit exaggerating? Because I hate to doubt his veracity.
(LAUGHTER)
MACDONALD: Right. Right. No. No. I don't think he's exaggerating. By the way, I just need to know information. What did he say about Eric Swalwell? No. I'm kidding.
NORTON: I don't know if he mentioned --
MACDONALD: I'm kidding.
NORTON: Oh, he did mention someone gay, and he said something very vulgar about him, and I really --
MACDONALD: Oh, OK. But did he -- he said the word -- term crop dusting? Did he --
NORTON: Crop dusting as in part.
MACDONALD: Need to use the "A" word instead of the "O" in that letter of crop or --
NORTON: Oh, crap. No. I couldn't believe he said it. When he said he crop dust something, he couldn't know what that means.
MACDONALD: Now, what do we do about Jerry Nadler? Should he have charcoal pills, or did Biden's climate rules outlaw charcoal pills for that?
NORTON: I mean, in my opinion, if Nadler smells and farts in Congress, we should stand up and applaud him.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
HURT: You basically have your own DOGE correspondent here.
GUTFELD: Yes.
HURT: Getting to the bottom of what actually matters in Washington.
GUTFELD: Literally getting to the bottom.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You know, Emily, we never hear about women smelling. What is it -- what's the secret that women have that they're never stinky? Like, no one - - I never in high school -- well, I went to an all guys school. Grade school call -- I never met a smelly girl.
COMPAGNO: Because women don't fart.
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: We don't have anal glands.
GUTFELD: Oh.
COMPAGNO: Look, here's my whole point about this. It is disgusting. There is nothing I hate more, and I think part of it is because I'm always on a plane or a train or an automobile, like commuting somewhere, like rubbing shoulders with everyone else of humans discussing, is what I -- there's nothing I hate more than people farting in public. I hate it.
And the fact that we just now learned that someone that represents us from this state is like or -- California here. It's like shuffling down shuffling down the aisles, crop dusting everyone. Like, that is disgusting. And it's George Santos that was, like, removed from the ethics investigation? Can we have the Ethics Committee investigate Nadler? Like, quirk your booty. Like, do not do that. No. Thank you.
GUTFELD: Quirk your booty.
COMPAGNO: Right, you guys?
GUTFELD: Quirk your booty.
COMPAGNO: I think it is a horrible, hideous, like, not talked about epidemic hygiene and how people smell. It infuriates me, and I -- literally I gagged just talking about -- like, I have, like -- obviously, like, I gag easily, whatever. So just smelling that in, like, in my mind too, like --
GUTFELD: Yeah. Yeah. I think there's going to "S" word.
COMPAGNO: I could've rip off --
GUTFELD: You know --
COMPAGNO: Disgusting. It rages me.
GUTFELD: Charlie, we know that something smells rotten in Congress, but we didn't think it was literally smelly. Who's the --
HURT: I have I have nothing to contribute to this.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Well, let me ask you. You're the newest member of Fox and Friends Weekend.
HURT: So -- but I will --
GUTFELD: Who is the smelliest member?
(LAUGHTER)
HURT: I would say this. I do think it's -- because I -- you know, I was at New York -- I was bureau DC Bureau Chief for the New York Post for years. So I covered, Jerry Nadler. And I was always amazed that, you know, people joke about D.C. being Hollywood for ugly people. And -- but this guy takes the cake.
(LAUGHTER)
HURT: I mean, this guy is the king of Hollywood for ugly people.
GUTFELD: He should be taking less cakes.
HURT: But what's kind of interesting about it is the reason you have these -- people that would never get elected anywhere else, all coming from New York. You know what it is?
GUTFELD: What?
HURT: It's because the media market in, New York City is the most expensive media market or right after L.A., in the country. And because these people run their campaigns on radio.
GUTFELD: Right.
HURT: So Chuck Schumer and pigpen get elected -- exactly, they have faces to radio.
GUTFELD: If you saw what you were voting for? Yes.
HURT: Or if the radio had smell, like, gauge smell, you would --
COMPAGNO: Sniff the boards.
HURT: Right. Exactly.
COMPAGNO: Sniff and you're like --
HURT: They would never win. Right.
GUTFELD: Oh, there you go. That's why I don't listen to the radio. I don't know what that means.
Up next, wokeism's defeat according to Mayor Pete.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got another clip of you. It's Video of the Day Part Two.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: A diversity hire thinks wokeism should retire. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg admitted this week that his party's approach to DEI is backfiring and, in fact, creating, quote, "Trump Republicans." Roll it, Phyllis.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETE BUTTIGIEG, FORMER TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: What do we mean when we talk about diversity? Is it making people sit through a training that looks like something out of "Portlandia."
It is how Trump Republicans are made, if that comes to your workplace, with the best intentions, but doesn't actually get at what actually matters here.
If we were serious about the actual values and not caught up in vocabularies and trying to cater to everybody only in terms of their particular slice of combinations of identities instead versus a shared project.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So let me get this straight, Mayor Pete.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You are against wokeness in vocabularies and combinations of identities, not because it's ridiculous, but because it leads to the creation of Trump voters. Then by all means, Dems, please continue down this path. But could he be saying this because he wants to move more to the middle for a potential presidential run in 2028? Personally, I think Americans would welcome a president that is gay. We just had one that was dead.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Liz, Liz, it kind of bugs me. It's that Democrat of saying something is only bad because you lose voters. It's not because it's bad because it could just be bad.
LIZ MCDONALD, HOST, "THE EVENING EDIT": Or it's not because it's because it's because of the way you speak. It's like listening to Justin Trudeau. I need a Google translator on him. I don't know what he's talking about half the time I'm listening to him. It's like a college on acid. I don't know what the hell he's saying. It's like bicycling through quicksand listening to him. It's draining. I just think the guy has got to stop talking, at least look in the mirror. As soon as you use words "vocabulary" or "identity" and he goes down that rabbit hole and wants us all to join him, no. It is a big no. DOGE should audit him for the overuse of words.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Nice.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Charlie, I never really trusted him ever since he faked riding his bike to work. Do you remember that?
CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, "THE WASHINGTON TIMES": Yes.
GUTFELD: So he's strikes me as a shape shifter with a weathervane instead of the spine. Now it's OK now to come out against identity politics because he's seeing it's not working.
HURT: Yes, he's a total fraud, and I think you're exactly right. He's doing it because he's trying -- and you saw he changed his Twitter profile to remove his pronouns. And also removed his husband and replaced him with a big pile of rocks, which I thought was kind of interesting.
GUTFELD: Wow.
HURT: So I think he is definitely sort of moving in sort of another direction.
But let's be clear. Let's not forget, this guy -- nobody would have ever heard of this guy in this room right now if it were not for DEI.
GUTFELD: That's true.
HURT: The only reason -- he was a failed mayor. He's a failed presidential candidate. The only reason anybody has ever heard of him is because of DEI. And it's kind of funny, because Democrats are always attacking Republicans of wanting to saw the bottom rungs of the ladder so people can't climb up. He's already climbed up the DEI ladder and now he's trying to saw off all the rungs.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: It's like, Emily, Mayor Pete got in through the backdoor and then put a lock on the backdoor.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: The backdoor of employment.
EMILY COMPAGNO, CO-HOST, "OUTNUMBERED": Sure.
GUTFELD: I'm not making any reference to the rectum.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You people are disgusting. What say you, Emily?
COMPAGNO: I think it's so fascinating that we are watching Dems conduct this total autopsy of what creates a Trump Republican. What are you talking about? If there was any self-awareness the entire time, they would realize, first of all, that a Trump Republican encompasses 76 million Americans. So he should just be saying, what creates people that hate people like me are.
And I agree with what he was saying, which is ironic, where he was essentially saying that if the concept of diversity is important we shouldn't have rammed it down people's throats in the way of "Portlandia." Skipping into the classroom and being like, everyone is equitable and here's why. But at the end of the day, there's never going to be a deviation from it because it was all based on --
And people say so-and-so peaked in high school, or whatever. I feel like we see that so often in the government bureaucracy, which is that it's not about peaking but just about the right fit. So maybe he was good at mayor. A lot of people think he wasn't for Indianapolis, but maybe he was good at mayor and he shouldn't have gone past it. But for some reason everyone intends to break through the ceiling and keep grasping for more and more without recognizing that they would be horrible at executive management. They would be horrible at governance and the like, right.
So I don't need someone who fakes bicycle riding to tell me why I am a Trump Republican when it's because of their horrible policies that were rammed down our throats, or rammed in the backdoor, for four years.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: He was mayor of South Bend. Mayor of South Bend.
MCDONALD: Yes, he couldn't fill a pothole.
GUTFELD: Yes, South Bend, I had that problem. But there's a drug for it.
Jim, coming after the B block, let's be honest in Mayor Pete's defense. You know he smells great.
JIM NORTON, COMEDIAN AND ACTOR: I guarantee it. He looks like every social studies teacher that I caught peaking at me in the urinal.
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: But I like what he said. I like what he said, and we can't get mad at people if they course correct.
GUTFELD: Right, better late than never.
NORTON: Better late than never, and I don't care about his motives. I don't care why he's doing it. I don't care why anybody in politics does it. Their motives are irrelevant to me.
And that Trump voter thing, yes, it's stupid, but he's not talking to Trump voters. He's talking to people that he needs to say that to because otherwise he has to say everything you have stood for has been a disaster. So you get more flies with honey than vinegar, and more dogs with peanut butter.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But you're making a good point, and I forget about it, I forget about that point, is that when somebody starts agreeing with you, don't get mad at them.
NORTON: Yes, and sure, the wokeism is not -- I didn't like the fact that he was, with the best of the intentions. Again, he's still in that club.
MCDONALD: I'm going to coin a term. You've been Buttigieg-ed. When he talks like that, you've been Buttigieg-ed. So that's what it is.
GUTFELD: Interesting. I don't think that's what it means in the bedroom.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, coming up, A.I. designed to read your mind.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A story in five words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Brain decoder why did I say that. Emily, this is very interesting, almost as interesting as you.
COMPAGNO: Cute. Thanks.
GUTFELD: Why did I say that? Scientists have improved an existing brain decoder that uses A.I. to turn thoughts into text. The technology could one day help people with speech impairments. Who cares?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But what about us? I want technology for us. Do you want people to be able to read your thoughts, and what would they be reading?
COMPAGNO: No, I do not, and that is exactly why. Do you remember the movie with Mel Gibson, your twin?
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: "What Women Want." And the whole point was that you actually, a, don't want to hear people's thoughts, and b, you don't want people to hear your thoughts, because at the end of the day what's in my head, it is not what comes out. You know what I mean? Everyone thinks I'm nice. There is a lot going on in here.
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: So for everyone's safety and the protection of you guys thinking I'm like a really nice person, the answer is a hard hell no. And also, the other thing is, if you're as sensitive as I am, I can't get it out of my head. If someone says something and it's mean, I never forget it, and it hurts me and it sears me deeply to the core. So imagine if I heard like if you just thought, you're like, oh, whatever, I was in a bad mood. I thought this thing about Emily. I would be like devastated forever. So no thank you to this.
GUTFELD: If you only knew what I was thinking right now.
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: Well, Jim, this seems like this could put you away for life.
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: It's very scary. It'd be like, why is he thinking of eating pudding out of Jerry Nadler's suit pants.
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: That makes me gag.
GUTFELD: The funny thing is, you had to think to think of that to say that. You did think of that.
NORTON: I'm going to go home and sketch it.
GUTFELD: Do you know what's funny, though, is don't we already read our with texting?
NORTON: Yes, and I was thinking, it's funny. I was thinking when you were reading this just the cheesy dad jokes of I want to know somebody's thoughts I'll look at their Twitter. But we're all putting our thoughts out there anyway. So there is some secret dark things, but eventually this will be how crimes are solved. And eventually we'll all be locked in and know each other's thoughts and you'll be punished for thought. It's going to go down that rabbit hold. Hopefully we'll be dead.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Hopefully we'll be dead. That's a great new segment. Hopefully we'll be dead.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I say that, that will be the heading of, are we ready for a women president?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Charlie.
HURT: I'm with Emily on this.
GUTFELD: Are you trying to get out of this?
HURT: No. I was just going to say, I am with Emily on this. I don't want people to know my thoughts and I don't want to know their thoughts. But if we do do this, I just don't want -- this is what I want more than anything. I don't want to hear people complaining when they find out what everybody's thoughts are. Because everybody is going to be offended, and I don't want to hear about it.
GUTFELD: They should do this, Liz, just for pets, like your dog. Could you just do it for your dog, where it's just like food, food, food, food, food.
(LAUGHTER)
MCDONALD: I have two dogs. If you put it on me, I'd be singing, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. That's what you'd hear from me. When are the price of eggs coming down? But you don't need a brain decoder on Trump, right. He's already out there. I think you need one on Pete Buttigieg. It's like following a gnat in a hurricane. I don't know what that guy is -- all right, we already did that segment. I'm sorry. But with me, it would be like, I don't remember my wi-fi password. That what you'd hear me talking about. Or how do you use the remote control, if you listen to my thoughts.
GUTFELD: No one would ever get married. There'd be no relationships. You wouldn't get past the third date.
MCDONALD: You would not, absolutely, especially the ones I've dated.
GUTFELD: Yes.
HURT: But I think there would be other situations where it would, like, the union would happen quicker.
GUTFELD: Interesting.
MCDONALD: The union?
GUTFELD: How so, Charlie?
HURT: Two people sitting in a bar and the look at each other.
MCDONALD: Let's have a union.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes, let's have a union, a more perfect union.
NORTON: My wife would asked me, hey, I'm reading your thoughts. Who is that person you see going off the balcony?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, up next, can we avoid a killer asteroid?
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't understand math.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: They kept saying Greg, you need more segments for women. And I said OK, let's do something called "I don't understand math." Give it to me baby. They are throwing things at me, but they throw like a girls, so who cares.
(BOOS)
GUTFELD: NASA says an asteroid has a 3.1 percent chance of hitting earth in the year 2032. But that doesn't make any sense to me. Either it hits earth or it doesn't. That's 50-50, right? If you said there's a 50 percent chance of hitting earth, you would still be as right as saying one percent. So that's why I don't understand math, and I'm a guy, Liz. You are a financial whiz. You must know math.
MCDONALD: I need a brain decoder on you and what you just said there.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Either you get hit by an asteroid or you don't.
MCDONALD: It's 50-50 odds.
GUTFELD: See! You don't know --
MCDONALD: I don't even know what the heck I'm talking about.
(LAUGHTER)
MCDONALD: I need a brain decoder on myself. Three percent odds, what's that mean? That's like me having triplets. I don't even know what that means.
GUTFELD: No, it's true. I don't understand this either. I guess it's probability, Jim. But it's not like -- I'm focusing on outcome. So it either happens or it doesn't. But they are talking about probability, which is a fractional number between one and zero that indicates a likely outcome. But we don't care about that.
NORTON: My niece asked me. He was very scared about this. And she goes, what does that mean? I said, shut up.
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: You're 31.
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: But I guess the answer is three percent would be, if there's 100 earths, three of them would get hit. When you play the lottery, you technically, but it's not a 50/50. It's one and 10 million. But 50-50 is a "yes" or a "no." But I guess the probability is a little bit different. I said nothing right there. Who am I, Kamala Harris?
(LAUGHTER)
NORTON: Word salad.
GUTFELD: I love it when people say word salad, hey this is clever, she talks like a word salad.
NORTON: I shouldn't being say that because my neck is getting fat.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Charlie, why is this story so important?
HURT: So unlike you, I'm not a mast genius. But I do know the difference between 3.1 percent and 50-50 chance. And these are different.
(LAUGHTER)
HURT: But I will say, a 3.1 percent chance is a pretty high likelihood when it comes to annihilating the earth with an asteroid. But I will tell you this, when I read this story, at first I was like, oh, that's alarming. But then I was really relieved, because we have Elon Musk. And we're just going to send him up there, and he's going to blow it up, and make it go a different direction.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: By the way, Emily, you take the three percent, but the earth is covered by 97 percent water. Is that right? I remember reading that as a child, or my masseuse telling me that.
HURT: It doesn't matter where it hits. If it hits it's going to be really bad. You're going to lose your show if it hits. Your "Variety" magazine cover is no longer going to matter.
GUTFELD: No, you know what will happen. They'll preempt the show depending on how many people die. That's how you know -- when you preempt, there is a level of death that you have to reach in order to be preempted. That's the unspoken truth of television. I think the number is six. I'm not sure. Emily?
COMPAGNO: This would be catastrophic.
HURT: Thank you.
COMPAGNO: OK, the outcome of this particular event is 50-50. Either it hits or it doesn't. But the probability that that happens is three in 100. And I just have to say this, that if someone was like, oh, it's a three in 100 chance you're going to get punched in the face on the subway. Oh, fine, I'll take the subway. But if it's total annihilation of the human race on earth, I'm like, oh, my God, terrified. So yes, please, Aerosmith, Ben Affleck, all the people, Elon Musk, bring them all and please shoot down this asteroid, respectfully.
GUTFELD: We don't look at it, though -- and we've got to move on. We don't look at it from the asteroid's perspective.
COMPAGNO: That's why I said respectfully.
GUTFELD: Yes, because the fact is, it's not like -- we are coming at the asteroid, too. And they are probably going, who are these stupid idiots? Don't they know math? Because there are living things on asteroids. That's where we got Adam Schiff.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, we'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Charles Hurt, Liz McDonald, Jim Norton, Emily Compagno, studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
