When the complete history of 's return to power from political exile is written, one of the most important players in the four-year drama that began with his 2020 election loss to  and ended with his defeat of Biden's handpicked successor may be a recalcitrant German Shepherd.
On November 28, 2020, then-President-elect Biden injured himself while playing with his dog, Major, at his Delaware home. According to statements issued to the press pool traveling with him at the time, Biden was taken for a CT scan that showed hairline fractures in his foot, an injury that required the use of a walking boot.
Whether it was out of vanity or stubbornness, Biden didn't wear the boot for long, so the fracture never healed properly, leaving him with a shuffling, arthritic gait that made him look exactly like the oldest president ever to serve in the nation's highest office.

President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized economic and travel sanctions against individuals involved in International Criminal Court investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies, including Israel, reiterating an action he took during his first term.
The move coincides with a visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who, along with his former defense minister and a leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, is wanted by the ICC for the war in the Gaza Strip.
It remains unclear how quickly the U.S. will announce the names of those sanctioned. During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top aides in response to the ICC's investigation into alleged war crimes by American troops in Afghanistan.
The ICC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The sanctions include freezing any U.S. assets of the designated individuals and prohibiting them and their families from entering the United States.

Trump AG disbands sanctions task force targeting Russian oligarchs
Thursday 6 February 2025 21:30
,
Oliver O'Connell
President Donald Trump's Justice Department is disbanding an effort initiated after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine aimed at enforcing sanctions and targeting oligarchs close to the Kremlin.
A memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi, issued on Wednesday amid a flurry of orders on her first day in office but not previously reported, stated that the initiative, known as Task Force KleptoCapture, will conclude as part of a shift in focus and funding toward combating drug cartels and international crime gangs.
"This policy requires a fundamental change in mindset and approach," Bondi wrote in the directive, adding that resources now devoted to enforcing sanctions and seizing the assets of oligarchs will be redirected to countering cartels.
Launched during the Biden administration, the effort aimed to strain the finances of wealthy associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin and to punish those facilitating sanctions and export control violations.
It formed part of a broader initiative to exclude Russia from global markets and to enforce extensive sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to widespread international condemnation of its war in Ukraine.
Prosecutors assigned to the task force will return to their previous positions. The changes will remain in effect for at least 90 days before a decision is made on their permanence.
Trump has talked about improving relations with Moscow and promised to end the war in Ukraine. A detailed plan of how he expects to do that is yet to emerge.
The focus on drug cartels follows Trump's designation of many such groups as terrorist organizations as part of his crackdown on illegal migrants and fentanyl trafficking.

Lawsuit filed challenging Trump's ban on transgender military service

Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation (HRCF) have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Trump administration's ban on military service by transgender individuals.

Six active-duty transgender service members have in Washington, D.C.
"This discriminatory ban is a threat to our national security, wastes years of training and financial investments, and is unconstitutional," said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal, Human Rights Campaign Foundation.
"Thousands of transgender servicemembers have already met the military's rigorous standards and more than proven themselves. Our military must be able to recruit the best candidates, retain the highly-trained servicemembers, and every qualified patriot should be able to serve free of discrimination. Thank you to the courageous plaintiffs who have already sacrificed so much for this country, and now are fighting to continue their service in the face of a cruel and dangerous ban."
"This ban not only wrongfully prevents patriotic, talented Americans from serving, it also compromises the safety and security of our country," said Sasha Buchert, counsel and nonbinary and transgender rights project director, at Lambda Legal. "Thousands of current service members are transgender, and many have been serving courageously and successfully in the U.S. military. Once again attacking a vulnerable population based on bias, political opportunism, and demonstrably untrue 'alternative facts,' President Trump is seeking to deny courageous transgender people the opportunity to serve our country. He's got to get through us first."
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of US Navy Commander Emily "Hawking" Shilling; US Navy Commander Blake Dremann; US Navy Lieutenant Commander Geirid Morgan; US Army Sergeant First Class Cathrine "Katie" Schmidt; US Army Sergeant First Class Jane Doe; US Air Force Staff Sergeant Videl Leins; and Matthew Medina, a transgender person seeking to enlist in the United States Marine Corps.
All the service members have nearly two decades of service.
