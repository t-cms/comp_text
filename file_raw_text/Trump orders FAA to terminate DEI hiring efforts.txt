President Trump on Tuesday issued an executive order directing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to “return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring” and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
“I hereby order the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administrator to immediately return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring, as required by law,” the directive read.
“All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication.”
The directive follows Trump’s Monday  to end DEI efforts across all federal workplaces. 
The Republican party leader said DEI hiring policies, which aim to consider individuals who have historically faced professional barriers due to racial or gender discrimination, may impede on passengers’ “confidence” in an individual’s abilities.
“Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence,” the order reads.
