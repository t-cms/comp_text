President Trump and his allies are blaming diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for contributing to  
Why it matters: Trump repeatedly cited DEI policies, a  
While the cause of the crash isn't yet known, Trump implicitly equated racial, gender and other forms of diversity with a lower-quality federal workforce.
Officials said Thursday that there hadn't been anything unusual about the flight paths for either aircraft leading up to the collision, nor had there been a breakdown in communications.
Asked Thursday if he was getting ahead of the official investigation by blaming DEI initiatives, Trump disagreed.
State of play: Other Trump administration officials echoed the president's sentiments about the connection between DEI and the quality of the federal workforce.
"We can only accept the best and the brightest in positions of safety that impact the lives of our loved ones, our family members," Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the press conference after Trump spoke.
Duffy also promised reforms after Trump's comments. "We are going to take responsibility at the Department of Transportation and the FAA to make sure we have the reforms that have been dictated by President Trump in place to make sure that these mistakes do not happen again and again."

People with such severe disabilities - including missing extremities, hearing and vision loss, and dwarfism - all qualified for air traffic controller positions under the DEI policies, Trump added.
Trump did not offer specific examples of when such hires had occurred. The FAA did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.
After slamming groups that had previously determined the FAA as being "too white," Trump added: "We want the people who are competent."
Driving the news: Trump wasted little time  
He also railed against former Transportation Secretary

The big picture: American Eagle Flight 5342 was en route from Wichita, Kansas to Washington, D.C. when it collided with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter late Wednesday.
The passenger jet was carrying 64 people on board while the helicopter was carrying three soldiers.
