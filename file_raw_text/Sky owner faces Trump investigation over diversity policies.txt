Highlight: Probe comes weeks after president labelled Comcast news channel MSNBC an ‘enemy of the people’
Body


The owner of Sky is being investigated over its diversity policies by . 
Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has written to Comcast over concerns that the company may be promoting “invidious forms of discrimination”.
It is the latest investigation launched by Mr Carr into US media networks . 
Comcast owns NBC, which runs Left-leaning news channel MSNBC. The president has described it as “close to death” and “the enemy of the people”.
In a letter to Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts, Mr Carr said that US communications laws prohibit regulated companies from discriminating on the basis of characteristics such as race and gender.
He said he was concerned that   at Comcast and its US network NBCUniversal could “deprive Americans of their rights to fair and equal treatment under the law”.
The investigation is unlikely to affect employees at Sky, the majority of whose staff are in Europe.
The British company, which Comcast acquired in 2018, has a series of DEI programmes designed to increase its share of staff who are black, Asian and ethnic minorities. It said in 2021 it would invest £10m a year “to improve representation and progression of minority groups”.
Mr Trump has vowed to wage war on DEI schemes in office. He   in his first week labelling the schemes illegal and saying they undermine hard work in favour of “an unlawful, corrosive and pernicious identity-based spoils system”.
A Comcast spokesman said: “We have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions. For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.”
Before his re-election, Mr Trump said that Comcast should be investigated for its “country threatening treason”.
Mr Carr has also criticised NBC after Kamala Harris . 
Comcast has described DEI as “a core value of our business”.
Its media rival Disney said this week it was joining a growing list of companies rowing back on DEI schemes, with its latest annual report removing mentions of its diversity schemes and the company   on its streaming service.
