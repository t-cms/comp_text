Trump's executive order dismantles federal DEI programs, sparking changes at institutions like Missouri State University. SEMO faces uncertainty as its DEI pages remain unavailable, raising questions.Sarah LerchGraphic by Sarah Lerch
Shortly after being presumed the next president of the United States, Trump announced his intention to abolish diversity and inclusion offices. His education plan also pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on various issues.
Within hours of President Donald Trump's first day of his second term, he signed 26 executive orders into action.
Among the orders signed was the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusivity programs within the federal government. According to the document published on the Federal Register website, this order will remove former President Biden's policy of furthering the programs.
The implementation of this executive order requires the dismantling of all federal DEI programs. This includes programs implemented within the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Departments of Defense, State and Veterans Affairs.
What is an executive order?
According to the Office of the Federal Register, "Executive orders are official documents, numbered consecutively, through which the President of the United States manages the operations of the Federal Government."
An order's purpose is to direct federal agencies or officials on how to enforce existing laws or policies.
Usually, it addresses policy issues, national security or government operations.
What is DEI?
DEI stands for "diversity, equity, and inclusion," which refers to programs and policies that advocate for fair treatment and inclusivity in the workplace, schools and organizations.
Daniel Oppong, founder of The Courage Collective, a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Consultancy told CNN, "DEI was created because marginalized communities have not always had equal opportunities for jobs or felt a sense of belonging in majority-White corporate settings."
President Trump's executive order justified reversing the Biden policy on the grounds that implementing DEI "demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination."
According to a memo obtained by CBS News, all federal DEI program employees would be placed on paid leave until further notice.
An institution's removal
Missouri State University discontinued its DEI initiatives on Jan. 29, nine days after President Trump's order was signed.
Though the institution is not a federal entity, its leaders still decided to remove its programs.
TRIO
According to the US Department of Education, "Federal TRIO Programs are Federal outreach and student services programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds."
Though TRIO has similar values to DEI programs such as inclusion and equality in the workplace, its services are still associated with the federal government.
Although Missouri State University removed its DEI programs, TRIO programs are still available on its website.
SEMO's TRIO director has declined to comment on the issue.
SEMO uncertainty
On Feb. 11, pages related to DEI were unavailable on SEMO's website. This included pages such as the LGBTQ+ resource center, Black Faculty and Staff Alliance, presidential task force on diversity and religion.
Other unavailable pages were dedicated to Equity Initiative and Title IX and Civil Rights Compliance.
Currently, the LGBTQ+ resource center, religion, Title IX and Civil Rights Compliance pages have been restored; however, the diversity, equity and inclusion, the Black Faculty Staff Alliance and the Presidential Task Force webpages remain unavailable.
University officials have not offered an official explanation for why the pages were inaccessible.
Though there was no reasoning given regarding the page's inaccessibility, SEMO President Carlos Vargas addressed the changes to faculty and staff.
In a statement sent to SEMO faculty and staff on Feb. 14, Vargas stated: "The Office of Equity Initiatives has been vacant since Dr. Nora Bouzihay left the university last fall. All programs and operations coordinated through the office were reassigned at that time. I have decided not to fill the position," Vargas stated.
As of Feb. 17, SEMO's diversity, equity and inclusion webpage was still unavailable. However, several resources previously linked to that page now appear on a page entitled "Diversity Committee Resources."
This webpage provides information on campus and community resources for wellness and addiction support, as well as local groups and organizations. The site also features a list of local Black-owned businesses. Story TagsNational NewsdiversityDEIAdvertisement
