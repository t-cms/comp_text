Highlight: Texas Governor Greg Abbott was called out by the state's largest newspaper over his recent comments related to DEI in higher education.
Body


Texas' largest newspaper accused Governor  of perpetuating "demagogic" tendencies when citing his threats against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education.
Newsweek has reached out to Abbott's communications director via email on Friday.
Why It Matters 
Shortly after taking office earlier this week, President  ordered what he called "ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferencing." DEI has become a flashpoint issue, particularly for , and Abbott, a Trump ally, has been an advocate of riding DEI policies prior to Trump assuming office.
The Houston Chronicle, the largest Texas newspaper, penned an article against Abbott's threat to Texas A&M University president over DEI, suggesting he is "following in the dishonorable footsteps of two of his predecessors when it comes to Texas higher education."
What To Know 
Earlier this month, Abbott threatened to terminate Texas A&M University President Mark Welsh III over claims the university violated the state's ban on DEI programs. The threat followed the release of a November 2024 university email that stated eligible PhD applicants for a conference must identify as Black, Hispanic, and Native American.
Abbott posted on X, formerly , in response to a screenshot of the application: "It's against Texas law and violates the US Constitution. It will be fixed immediately or the president will soon be gone."
In 2023, Abbott signed a law banning diversity hiring programs, DEI training, and DEI offices in public higher education.
"Declaring war on DEI is all the rage in conservative politics," the Houston Chronicle editorial board wrote in its January 23 opinion piece titled "Is DEI the new 'communism?' Trump and Abbott follow familiar playbook."
The board later added, "Abbott's threat has had a chilling effect across the state," noting that the university did not send any participants to the conference.
The editorial called out Abbott's move, suggesting that the "losers in all of this aren't radical left-wing DEI fanatics but young Texas capitalists who'd have a better chance of making a buck if PhD programs train business school faculty who mirror the diversity of our great state."
The board argued that "Abbott's threat goes well beyond an attempt to correct DEI excesses. It strikes at the core of recruiting talented students for, yes, merit-based admissions. Such outreach isn't about lowering standards; it's about raising awareness and widening access to academic opportunity for all who can compete."
What People Are Saying
Texas A&M University President Mark A. Welsh III said in a January 13 statement on X: "Texas A&M does not support any organization, conference, process or activity that excludes people based on race, creed, gender, age or any other discriminating factor. The intent of SB-17 is very clear in that regard. We will continue to honor both the letter and the intent of the law."
Christopher Rufo, conservative activist who vocally opposes DEI initiatives, wrote in a January 13 X : "Texas A&M is sponsoring a trip to a DEI conference that prohibits whites and Asians from attending. The university falsely claims that this use of taxpayer funds does not violate the state's DEI ban.  is supporting racial segregation and breaking the law."
Michael Steele, co-host of The Weekend, said on MSNBC: "DEI vs. Meritocracy is a false comparison, it's a false argument to make. The presumption is if you are embracing diversity in your workforce...that you're somehow buying into this idea that these individuals are not worthy of the responsibility and the job, that they are not meritoriously considered."
What Happens Next 
Abbott has two years remaining in his term after winning reelection in 2022. The Board of Regents, appointed by the governor, holds the authority to hire and fire university staff, not Abbott directly.
