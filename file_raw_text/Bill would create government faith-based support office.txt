Florida Governor Ron DeSantis looks to further his mission to push faith and community services as he is seeking $150,000 in the state budget to establish an office focused on providing faith-based services to Floridians.
According to the Floridian, this new office will be led by a governor-appointed "liason for faith and community" and will act as an adviser for faith- and community-based agencies.
This legislation, as filed by Rep.Douglas Michael Bankson in HB293, explains that this new office would be responsible for being a direct connection to the governor's office for religious and community members.
This action is part of a more significant trend of using community organizations to address social concerns by incorporating faith-based initiatives into the state's governance. Proponents contend that by using existing community networks, these partnerships can improve service delivery. However, opponents have voiced worries about the possibility of unequal support among various religious groups and the separation of religion and state.
Formalizing the state's engagement with faith-based organizations by creating this office could result in more resources and support for these organizations. Additionally, it emphasizes the administration's dedication to working with community partners to address social issues.
If enacted, this bill would go into effect July 1.
This comes as the White House creates its own national "White House Faith Office." This is one of many executive orders established by President Donald Trump. In his order, he states that this office was created to "assist faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship in their efforts to strengthen American families, promote work and self-sufficiency, and protect religious liberty..."
This program expands on earlier attempts to include religious institutions in federal policymaking. The White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives was founded in 2001 by President George W. Bush to increase the contribution of religious institutions to social services. 
Under President Barack Obama, the position persisted as the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing community involvement and interfaith collaboration.
The White House Faith Office, renamed in recent weeks by the Trump administration, prioritized religious freedom and lowered bureaucratic obstacles for religious organizations seeking federal funding. In line with programs like extending religious exemptions in healthcare and education, the executive order strengthened the administration's more significant attempts to prioritize religious organizations when formulating policies. However, detractors claimed that the position conflated religion and state, causing them to worry about a possible partiality and a lack of supervision in distributing funds.
This office was created with a more general change in federal policy, such as a recent executive order that removed diversity, equity, and inclusion programs from federal records. Critics claim that this action undercuts initiatives to advance equal opportunity and eliminate structural inequalities, which has caused controversy. 
Some have questioned if the government favors religious organizations while ignoring initiatives meant to promote inclusion because of the timing of the faith-based effort and the repeal of DEI rules.
The establishment of this institution raises questions for many Americans over how to strike a balance between governmental policy and religious influence. Opponents worry it would indicate a move away from pluralism and equal representation, while supporters see it as a reaffirmation of the significance of faith in forming communities and bolstering social services. 
The initiative's execution and its effects on state and federal policies will probably continue to be a topic of discussion throughout the country as discussions progress.
As of Feb. 6, this legislation was in the Government Operations Subcommittee.
