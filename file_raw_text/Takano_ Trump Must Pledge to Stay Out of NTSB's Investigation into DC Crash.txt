Takano: Trump Must Pledge to Stay Out of NTSB's Investigation into DC Crash
January 31, 2025
#
RIVERSIDE, CA -- Today, Congressman Mark Takano (CA-39), called on President Donald Trump to publicly pledge to the American people that he will not interfere with or politicize the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation into the tragic air accident above Washington, D.C. just days ago.
Instead of explaining to the American people how he would make air travel safer or commit to transparency, Trump jumped to premature conclusions and attacked DEI policies with no evidence of connection to the crash. Additionally, he has yet to justify gutting key safety and oversight roles, including pushing out the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), gutting a key aviation safety committee, and firing the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation (DOT).
"My heart breaks for the families whose loved ones died in this terrible, tragic crash over D.C.," said Rep. Takano. "In a moment when our President should be bringing the country together, President Trump's response to this tragedy has been alarming: rushing to conclusions and making baseless political attacks. This cannot spill over into the NTSB's nonpartisan work into uncovering what actually caused this crash. President Trump must publicly pledge to the American people that he will stay out of the NTSB's independent investigation. Americans need the truth, not to have their trust further eroded."
