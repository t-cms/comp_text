The White House is set to commemorate Black History Month on Thursday with an event hosted by President , though his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives has reshaped the observance of the month elsewhere.
Why It Matters
Trump has positioned himself as a vocal critic of DEI programs, calling them "discrimination" and moving to dismantle such initiatives across federal agencies. Last month, he signed an  mandating an end to government-funded DEI efforts and directing that employees in DEI-related roles be phased out. The administration has also exerted pressure on  to similarly shift their focus away from DEI initiatives.
The executive order has led to confusion within federal agencies, with some interpreting it as a restriction on how they acknowledge race in history and culture or how they report demographic data. The Department of Defense, for instance,  saying that "identity months"—such as Black History Month, Women's History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month—would no longer be observed during working hours.
What To Know
Trump's Black History Month event is set to take place in the East Room of the White House, with Black political figures, activists and entertainers aligned with his administration expected to attend.
According to a White House official, the guest list includes Senator , a South Carolina  and erstwhile presidential candidate; Michigan Representative John James; prison reform advocate Alice Johnson; and civil rights activist Alveda King. Former ESPN host Sage Steele, former  player Jack Brewer and rappers Kodak Black, Lil Boosie and Rod Wave are also expected to attend.
The event, originally scheduled for last week, was postponed because of inclement weather. On January 31, Trump signed a proclamation urging "public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities." However, agencies have discretion on whether to officially recognize Black History Month.
On February 1, the first day of Black History Month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that his department would "no longer participate in celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances."
Similarly, a diplomatic cable from Secretary of State  signaled the State Department's shift away from DEI policies. It said the focus should be on eliminating "political and cultural causes that are divisive at home and deeply unpopular abroad."
What People Are Saying
CJ Pearson, a national co-chair of the Republican National Committee's youth advisory council, said: "President Trump's anti-DEI policies aren't promoting racism but what they are doing is manifesting the dream of the great Martin Luther King, Jr.: a nation where one isn't judged by the color of their skin but instead by the content of their character."
Raynard Jackson, a Republican strategist, said: "Trump can build upon the coalition he pulled together in November with Blacks and Asians and Hispanics and young folks. But if they leave it the way it stands right now, Trump is going to destroy the very coalition he so marvelously brought to the table in November."
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in January: "We will continue to celebrate American history and the contributions that all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or creed, have made to our great country."
What Happens Next
It remains to be seen how the administration and various agencies plan to treat other commemorative months, including Women's History Month in March and Pride Month in June.
