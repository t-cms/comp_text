The university's annual Campus Climate Survey
Alex Soto, Campus News Editor
February 18, 2025
Until Feb. 21, university students, staff and faculty can anonymously fill out the 2025 Campus Climate Survey for Diversity and Inclusion. The survey has been conducted at the school for more than a decade, and is open to all students, staff and faculty who are older than 18.
Danielle T. Cooper, director of research at the Tow Youth Justice Institute and the Inclusion Diversity Equity and Access Council co-chair said the survey's purpose is to "build and promote a supportive campus community where all individuals are treated with respect and have the opportunity to learn from others in our increasingly global society." .
The survey comes at a time where students may feel concerned not just on campus, but throughout the country with government offices, companies and universities eliminating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs. Last year, Alabama, Iowa, and Utah prohibited DEI offices in their public universities, following in the steps of Florida and Texas, both of which made this move in 2023. Executive orders signed by President Trump and guidance from the Office of Personnel Management have also led to the Department of Education to remove or archive hundreds of training materials. This includes documents and reports that have mentions of DEI from their outward communication channels.
The survey allows students to share their perceptions of the university, personal experiences and give recommendations to advance its diversity and inclusion. University assures students within the survey that, "there are no risks in participating in this research beyond those experienced in everyday life."
Students who experience any discomfort or find a question disturbing are encouraged to contact the offices involved in the making of the survey, or to access university resources. Should one of these issues need to be reported, students can visit the school's "Report It! Don't Ignore it!" page and a bias incident report form can be filled out.
The university pays attention to these surveys' results, and has implemented some of the recommendations. At least seven practices the university prioritizes came from the 2023 campus climate survey, which saw nearly 1500 students and 600 staff members respond.
The survey takes roughly 20 minutes to complete. After the results are collected, the findings will be reported to the campus community on IDEA Council's MyCharger page.
Participation is voluntary, and people who choose not to participate are not penalized. To get as many responses as possible, the school is offering incentives ranging from Amazon gift cards to Early Housing Selection Slots.
The gift cards are offered weekly. All participants' responses will remain anonymous, with only student emails to be recorded to verify participation using survey links specific to each participant. Any questions should be directed to Cooper at [email protected].
