Villanova's Response to the Dismantling of DEI
Isabella Balian, Staff Writer
February 12, 2025
Erick Quezada The Villanovan spoke to students and faculty who work in DEI sectors on campus to understand the consequences of these orders on their work.
Throughout the course of President Donald Trump's campaign, he targeted current DEI initiatives within the federal government and within various American institutions. On Jan. 20, 2025, he signed two DEI-related executive orders related to gender and government DEI programs. The first order is titled "Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government" and the second is "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing." On Jan. 21, 2025, he signed another order, focusing on restoring merit-based opportunities, titled "Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity."
Days after Trump's executive orders, Northeastern University, a private university in the heart of Boston, removed language related to DEI from its website. So far, Villanova has not released any official statements or actions. Villanova's Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is committed to forging relationships across lines of differences and promoting diversity within all teaching and learning experiences. Its website includes statements of antiracism, a diversity statement and a land acknowledgement statement. 
The Villanovan spoke to students and faculty who work in DEI sectors on campus to understand the consequences of these orders on their work. The Office of DEI recently announced the appointment of Ariella Robbins as Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Robbins was asked about the importance of DEI at Villanova. 
"It is grounded and reflected in our Augustinian Catholic mission and values," Robbins said in an email. "Our values of truth, unity and love ensure that we work to create and sustain a culture and climate that is welcoming, compassionate and just," Robbins said. 
Robbins also mentioned Villanova's mission statement and how this intersects with the goals of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
"By centering our mission, we can build a diverse and harmonious living and learning environment where the needs of all community members are met, as we move towards the common good," Robbins said. "Our Augustinian values guide us in our commitment to the social responsibility of having a positive impact on the world around us."
The Villanovan also spoke with two members of Villanova's Student Government Association, Kenza Idrissi Janati and Akintade Asalu, who both hold leadership positions pertaining to DEI. We asked both students about the role of DEI at Villanova and their personal experiences with DEI. 
"As the Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for Villanova's Student Government Association, my role is to work with administration and advocate for initiatives that ensure every student feels a sense of belonging on campus," Janati said. 
Janati and Robbins both mentioned Villanova's values in accordance with the mission of DEI, and how this will lead the future of DEI at Villanova. 
"As we work to understand the implications of recent actions and executive orders, my office and University leaders across campus are committed to the values that are foundational to Villanova," Robbins said. "It is through our mission-centric work that we intentionally make space for and affirm different voices and lived experiences to strengthen our university for the future."
Similarly, Janati emphasized her continued pursuit of DEI initiatives within SGA. 
"Despite the growing national pushback against DEI efforts, we remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering an inclusive environment where marginalized and underrepresented students can thrive," she said. "Upholding Villanova's core values of veritas, unitas and caritas means ensuring that diversity, equity and inclusion remain integral to our community."
Asalu, also a senior student, currently serves as the SGA DEI Department Chair, and previously served as the co-Chair of the Caucus of Underrepresented Student Associations. 
Asalu said he was disappointed at the Trump administration's dismantling of federal DEI programs, but not surprised. 
"We have seen over the past eight years how President Trump continues to utilize his privilege to impact policy without consideration for the conditions of other underrepresented identities," he said. 
He then spoke about the importance of DEI initiatives and values at Villanova. 
"This school is primarily white and wealthy, meaning that the social norms and experiences of the people fitting that archetype are represented heavily in the culture and classroom," he said. 
He also noted that DEI provides an outlet for people who do not fit the stereotypical racial or economic mold at Villanova. 
Asalu also stated that DEI initiatives create an opportunity for people to "share their experiences and help foster an environment where more people are aware of the world outside of themselves."
In addition to a holistic perspective of DEI within the Villanova community, Asalu discussed his personal experiences with DEI Villanova. 
"I have been attending predominantly-white institutions since I was 10 years old, and I learned very quickly that there was a clear cultural divide between my peers and me," Asalu said.
Asalu spoke about his difficulty in finding his place on campus during the beginning of his Villlanova experience, and how his role in SGA transformed his experience. 
"I was not involved in any clubs in my first two years here, and to be frank I was miserable," Asalu said. "All of that changed when I joined the DEI Department and met Kenza and others. Through working in DEI, I was able to find a group of people who understand my experiences as a person of color, making my time at Villanova more bearable."
He told The Villanovan of his hopes that the University would continue its DEI efforts. 
"I hope the University is willing to reach out to students and work on a way in which we can support underrepresented students better," Asalu said.
Both Janati and Asalu are hopeful that the university will continue its DEI efforts on an administrative level and within sectors of student life. Robbins affirmed her hope that Villanova will continue to build a community stringent on its Augustinian values. 
"Creating a diverse and inclusive campus community is a part of Villanova's history, and we continue to build a community where we can broaden perspectives, encourage academic collaboration and connection and prepare students to respond to the complexities of a global world," Robbins said.
