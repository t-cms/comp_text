Villanova Reacts To Federal Guidance On Higher Education
Finn Courtney, Co-News Editor
February 20, 2025
Erick Quezada University President Father Peter M. Donohue, O.S.A., Ph.D. released an email to the Villanova community addressing the recent changes in higher education guidance.
Since the inauguration of President Donald Trump a little under a month ago, widespread change has already run rampant through the country. By signing more than 60 executive orders and installing appointees across the federal government, Trump has taken aim at things like transgender rights, diversity, equity and inclusion policies and education - specifically its handling of race-based programs, courses and scholarships.
In a statement released Friday, the Department of Education warned all educational institutions, but specifically those of higher learning, to comply with orders to remove race-based decisions from all student, academic and campus life within the next 14 days. If a school refused to comply, that school would be subject to an investigation and a likely loss of federal funding.
"Discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible," Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor wrote in a statement last Friday. "Accordingly, I write to clarify and reaffirm the nondiscrimination obligations of schools and other entities that receive federal financial assistance from the United States Department of Education (Department)[...] Institutions that fail to comply with federal civil rights law may, consistent with applicable law, face potential loss of federal funding."
On Wednesday, University President Father Peter M. Donohue, O.S.A., Ph.D. released an email to the Villanova community addressing the recent changes and what the next steps for the University are in compliance with those guidelines, while still committing itself to the hallmarks of Villanova's Catholic Augustinian roots.
"Over the past several weeks, we have been closely monitoring the updates to federal policies and the potential impacts on the Villanova community," Father Peter said. "I know there has been much uncertainty regarding what these changes might mean for you, your family and your friends. In the fullest sense of transparency, we will need to make some changes to comply with these orders, but I assure you that all community members will continue to have a place at Villanova."
As wave after wave of new executive orders and actions on behalf of the Trump administration continue to roll out, the future regarding this and what guidance will be issued is still widely unknown or in the early stages. In the meanwhile, Villanova students who comprise a student body that in majority voted in favor of Trump's opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last election are digesting the news of the University's compliance.
"I understand why it needed to be done, the compliance with the order, but at the same time, it's kind of heartbreaking to the leader of an institution that one, I look up to and two, I'm part of, comply with a frankly spineless attempt to set people of color and marginalized groups back hundreds of years," sophomore Nels Rolf said. "I've been a first-hand witness to the fact that many people on this campus don't understand what DEI is. They've listened to and internalized a lot of the false information and right-leaning talking points that say it's this evil and unjust thing when in reality, it's a beneficial and backbone part of our society and the way the world works."
The email sent earlier today is indicative of what's happening coast-to-coast, as institutions like the University of Pennsylvania, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, West Point and more are backing down to the terms of what the Trump administration demanded. For Villanovans, this latest development offers more questions than answers on how their lives will be affected on campus.
"Based on Father Peter's past speeches and the values of Villanova, I believe that the university will handle [??President Trump's DEI policies] appropriately," a student who requested anonymity said. "It depends on how the administration navigates compliance and upholding its values and DEI efforts while following these newly-enforced policies. The coming months will reveal whether Villanova can adapt while remaining strong in its commitment to a diverse and welcoming campus."
With Republican control over the executive and legislative branches until at least 2026, as well as a majority right-leaning Supreme Court, more orders and warnings are likely to come on a host of issues, likely sliding the country further to the right-wing than it has before.
"Obviously, I was upset to see that Trump rolled [DEI] back," Rolf said. "But even more so, just heartbroken that we have to comply with something that is so spineless and so gross and so, I feel morally and I wish constitutionally wrong."
While the email did not address what those specific changes will be or how they'll affect Villanova's current day-to-day operations for both students and faculty, Father Peter promised that he and the administration will continue to operate transparently as developments occur.
"I will share updates and support as we learn more," Father Peter said. "As always, I am heartened that we have amazing community members who are committed to our values and ideals and will continue to live them out in their daily interactions with one another."
