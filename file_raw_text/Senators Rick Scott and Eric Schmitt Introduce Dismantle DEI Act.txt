Senators Rick Scott and Eric Schmitt Introduce Dismantle DEI Act
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Eric Schmitt and Congressman Michael Cloud to introduce the Dismantle DEI Act, which would codify President Trump's executive actions on terminating DEI programs and initiatives, preventing future administrations from reinstating similar Biden-era DEI policies.
Senator Rick Scott said, "Democrats spent the past four years pushing policies that prioritized radical far-left ideology over merit-based policies throughout our federal government. That's not what the American people want, and they sure as heck don't want to be left footing the bill for a woke agenda they don't believe in. I'm glad to see President Trump work to return our federal government to the meritocracy it should be, and I encourage my colleagues to support our Dismantle DEI Act to codify his actions and make Washington work better for the American people."
Senator Eric Schmitt said, "DEI has plagued our federal government, academic institutions, and other aspects of our society for far too long, all while disregarding merit in the process. America is the greatest meritocracy the world has ever seen, and no taxpayer dollars should be wasted on funding this divisive ideology which undercuts the values our country was founded on. President Trump understands that these programs have absolutely no business in the federal government, and I am proud to introduce this critical legislation with Congressman Cloud that will save taxpayer dollars and put a stop to this DEI madness."
BACKGROUND:
* On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, "Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing." This executive action terminates diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and initiatives throughout all federal departments and agencies, while also compiling a list of those federal contractors and grantees associated with those same programs.
* President Trump helped reverse many of the Biden administration's prior executive actions on DEI programs.
* The Dismantle DEI Act helps build on the President's agenda by:
* Ensuring all DEI offices are terminated and prohibiting agencies from renaming or repurposing them to continue the same functions under new titles.
* Barring federal funds from being used for DEI training, grants, or programs--including identity-based quotas and critical race theory.
* Granting individuals the legal right to challenge any of these violations in court.
* Senators Cotton, Lankford, Daines, Tuberville, Blackburn, Marshall, Lummis, Cassidy, Risch, Cramer, Banks, Sheehy, Hyde-Smith, Lee, Crapo, Johnson, Budd, and Hawley joined Senator Schmitt and Senator Scott in introducing this legislation.
