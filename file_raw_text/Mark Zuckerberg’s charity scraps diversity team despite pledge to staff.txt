Highlight: Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will abandon DEI programmes and funding for inclusivity projects
Body


A multibillion-dollar charity founded by   has scrapped its diversity team and cancelled funding for projects promoting inclusivity.
The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), which handles the philanthropic efforts of Mr Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, told staff it would abandon a series of programmes aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).
The for-profit charity will drop its internal DEI initiatives and stop all “social advocacy funding”, including work focused on immigration and countering racism.
In an email to employees, Marc Malandro, CZI’s chief operating officer, said: “We will no longer have a diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility team at CZI.”
The email added that the three members of its DEI team had moved to new roles.
The organisation has dropped its so-called diverse slate practice, an inclusive hiring policy, and told applicants for $1.1m (£870,000) of grant funding for a programme celebrating diversity in science that the award had been cancelled. The charity also scrubbed mentions of diversity from its website, including a statement that the foundation focused its work through “a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens”.
The charity would instead focus on “biology and AI” funding and will lay off staff within its community team, which had worked on promoting “economic inclusion”.
The decision comes weeks after staff at the CZI were reassured that  , which owns Facebook and Instagram, would not impact the charitable organisation.
Meta cancelled a host of DEI programmes in January, days before the inauguration of Donald Trump, who has railed against “radical” and “illegal” corporate diversity initiatives. The White House has cancelled US government DEI programmes and hiring, while pro-Trump activist shareholders have targeted companies that promote diversity programmes.
Mr Zuckerberg, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump’s new administration, has spoken out against “culturally neutered” corporations. He has ordered Meta to rewrite its moderation policies and claimed that DEI had “increasingly been used to shut down opinions”.
US companies have been scrambling to drop mentions of DEI from their websites and hiring pages. Other technology giants including Amazon and Google have dropped diversity pledges since Mr Trump took office.
The CZI aims to give away or invest in good causes, operating as a for-profit charity. Mr Zuckerberg has promised to donate 99pc of his $247bn fortune. Mr Zuckerberg and his wife Ms Chan serve as co-chief executives of the CZI.
