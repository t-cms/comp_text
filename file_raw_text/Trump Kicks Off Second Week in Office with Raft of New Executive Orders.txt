Highlight: Trump announced a slew of new executive orders related to DEI initiatives and transgender people serving in the military.
Body


President  continued his executive order spree on Monday, signing a slew of new actions related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and transgender military servicemembers, the development of an "American Iron Dome" and more.
Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email Monday evening.
Why It Matters
Trump hit the ground running after being inaugurated last week and has signed dozens of executive orders and other actions undoing the Biden administration's policies and forging ahead with Trump's campaign pledge to crack down on immigration, increase offshore drilling, roll back DEI programs and transgender rights and purge the federal government of officials deemed insufficiently loyal to the president's agenda.
What To Know
Trump announced Monday's orders while addressing  lawmakers at a retreat at the Trump National Doral Miami.
As , one of the executive actions orders the reinstatement of military servicemembers who were discharged because they refused to comply with COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Another mandates the development of an "American Iron Dome" missile defense system.
A third eliminates "gender radicalism in the military," as Trump phrases, while a fourth order eradicates DEI military initiatives. The fifth action was a proclamation commemorating the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.
"We have to have a strong, strong defense," Trump told  at his south Florida resort earlier Monday. "And in a little while, I'll be signing four new executive orders."
