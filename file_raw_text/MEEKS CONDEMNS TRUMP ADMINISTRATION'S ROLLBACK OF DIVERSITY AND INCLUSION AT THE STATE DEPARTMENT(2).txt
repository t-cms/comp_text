The following information was released by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, Democrats:
Today, Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued the following statement on the Trump Administration's decision to rescind the civil rights era ban on discrimination in federal hiring and dismantle Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) initiatives at the State Department, USAID and across all federal agencies:
I am deeply concerned by the Trump Administrations decision to remove protections for Americans from discrimination in federal hiring. This dismantling of civil rights protectionsincluding to end all DEI-related programswill further narrow opportunity and inclusion for people seeking to work for the federal government.
Successive administrationson a bipartisan basis and going back more than two decades, including the first Trump Administrationrecognized the importance of ensuring a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive State Department and USAID to our national security.Data shows that diversity and inclusion are value adds in decision-making, and organizations that embrace them perform better.
These programs and policies are meant to ensure that the State Department recruits the best and brightest our nation has to offer and expand opportunity to populations historically excluded from careers in national security.Diversity is not the dirty word MAGA Republicans make it out to be, but one of Americas greatest strengths. By issuing these executive orders, President Trump is weakening our federal agencies and handing a victory to our adversaries.Its self-sabotage.
Its deeply disappointing that Secretary Rubio has begun his tenure as Secretary of State disavowing the very laws which healongside a bipartisan group of lawmakersvoted to support.
