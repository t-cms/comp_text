(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Jim Norton, Charly Arnolt, Timpf, Tyrus, our studio audience. "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT" is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Trace Gallagher. It's 8:00 on the West Coast, 11:00 p.m. here in New York City, and this is America's late news, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.
And breaking tonight, the executive orders keep coming, including the release of the JFK, RFK, and MLK assassination files. Trump also pardoning 23 pro-life protesters convicted under the Biden Justice Department for demonstrating outside abortion clinics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Many of them are elderly people. They should not have been prosecuted.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: And President Trump is about to embark on the first domestic trip of his second term, stopping in North Carolina, California, and Nevada.
TRUMP: Look, we're going to take care of Los Angeles. I'm going there. I'm going to North Carolina, which has been abandoned by the Democrats.
I'm really going to Nevada to thank them for the vote, because we won Nevada overwhelmingly. And that's usually a democrat vote.
GALLAGHER: But will he meet face to face with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has vowed to oppose him at every turn?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Will you meet with Gavin?
TRUMP: I don't know. I haven't even thought about it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Meantime, Pete Hegseth, clearing a big hurdle in his effort to become the nation's next secretary of defense. But does he have enough support when the full Senate votes tomorrow?
Plus, ICE, now making more than 500 arrests, issuing some 400 detainers in just a few days.
And we're now learning exactly who has been free to roam the U.S.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going back to Haiti!
Trump! You feel me? Joe Biden forever, bro! Thank Obama for everything he did for me, bro!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: More on that in moments. But first, the national -- senior national correspondent Kevin Corke, who is live for us in D.C., with more on President Trump's fast and furious first week. Kevin, good evening.
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Perfect way to put it, my friend. Evening to you and what a week. And frankly, it's not over yet, as you know.
Now, the president's gone from celebrating his return to the Oval Office to planning, as you pointed out, a coast-to-coast trip for disaster zones and desperate need of federal assistance.
Listen, he's gone from swearing in to delivering a pointed inaugural address and getting a little help finding a letter left by his predecessor -- thank you, Peter Doocy. He's gone from that to pardons, the end of DEI and A.I. infrastructure rollout. It's been quite a week for the president, who not only ordered 1500 troops to the southern border, he also declassified the decades' old JFK, RFK Junior, and MLK Junior assassination files. All ahead of planned trips to North Carolina and California, again, as mentioned.
And as he's done every day, this week, the president, once again today, signed a bevy of executive actions and orders. He also held Court with reporters, and yes, he even managed to virtually speak with leaders at the World Economic Forum, all while preparing to, let's just call it for what it is, joust, economically and politically, with friends and foes abroad alike, including China's Xi Jinping.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: He was like my friend. We had a very good relationship. I had a very good relationship with Putin, also. I have -- I would say Iran is a different story, I want to be honest with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CORKE: Yes, he's got his work cut out.
Also, today, the president's pick for CIA director was confirmed by the Senate. His former DNI, John Ratcliffe, taking the reins at Langley. And his Pentagon pick, Pete Hegseth, also clearing a procedural hurdle for a final Senate vote to advance his confirmation. We, of course, will be watching that very, very carefully.
Meantime, real quick, Trace. I just want to point out a federal judge has temporarily halted the president's plan to end birthright citizenship, though the administration is vowing to take the fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed. Back to you.
GALLAGHER: It might go that far.
CORKE: Yes.
GALLAGHER: Kevin Corke, live for us in D.C. Kevin, thank you.
Well, tonight, we take you on patrol in Boston with federal agents as they begin to enforce the president's new mass deportation policy.
Bill Melugin got exclusive access, amazing images, and one big surprise.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to be targeting some extremely violent offenders today.
BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The White House is reacting tonight to Fox News' exclusive embed with ICE deportation officers in the sanctuary city of Boston.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going back to Haiti! You feel me?
MELUGIN: During that embed, we witnessed ICE arresting this combative Haitian man who ICE says is a gang member with 17 criminal convictions. And he had this to say.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump! You feel me? Joe Biden forever, bro! Thank Obama for everything he did for me, bro!
MELUGIN (voice over): Vice President J.D. Vance, reacting to that today, writing on X, "An illegal alien with 17 criminal convictions really hates President Trump for sending him back to Haiti. He is grateful to Biden for letting him come here. I'm glad we're deporting him."
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also responded, posting on X, "Bye, bye!"
Fox News witnessed ICE make a handful of arrests of other egregious criminal aliens. They include this M.S.-13 gang member, wanted for aggravated murder in El Salvador, with an Interpol Red Notice out for his arrest.
This Brazilian illegal alien, also with an Interpol Red Notice out for his arrest for armed robbery.
This Salvadoran man arrested locally for rape and released by sanctuary jurisdiction.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, come asylum.
MELUGIN (voice over): This Dominican man, charged locally with assault with a deadly weapon, a box cutter, and heroin trafficking.
And this Guatemalan illegal alien, who ICE says is an active M.S.-13 gang member, facing local gun charges.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MELUGIN: And an interesting thing that happened during our embed, during one of the arrests, a woman came out from the neighborhood, came up to ICE and said, thank you for making the arrest. ICE responded and said, you're welcome. But it just goes to show, even in a sanctuary area like Boston, there are some locals out here that are appreciative of what ICE is trying to do.
Reporting in Boston, Bill Melugin, Fox News.
GALLAGHER: Bill, thank you.
Let's bring in Princeton University political scientist Lauren Wright and RNC national spokeswoman Elizabeth Pipko. Thank you both for coming on.
Lauren, to you first. I want to play the sound again. We heard it a couple times there with Bill, at least two parts of it.
LAUREN WRIGHT, POLITICAL SCIENTIST, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Yes.
GALLAGHER: Of the Haitian migrant who was arrested. 17 convictions.
WRIGHT: Yes.
GALLAGHER: And he said -- he said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going back to Haiti! Trump! You feel me? Joe Biden forever, bro! Thank Obama for everything that he did for me, bro!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Just to come full circle, Tom Homan, says, oh, he is going back to Haiti.
WRIGHT: Yes, yes. Right, right. And it just made me think of the immigration debate that was unfolding about whether illegal immigrants commit crimes at higher and lower rates, and Democrats were just completely missing the point on this throughout the campaign.
For a better part of a year, Biden staffers have these stats. The point is it should be zero. There should be zero people like this in the country with that kind of record. I mean, even one case is really infuriating to people, and so, that's why, I think it's just very obvious why the election turned out the way it did.
GALLAGHER: Yes.
WRIGHT: Immigration is one of those issues.
GALLAGHER: Yes, and he was thanking Biden and praising Obama, and he kind of goes on from there.
Elizabeth Pipko, welcome back. Thank you for coming on. Here is more of Trump on "HANNITY". Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It does. It feels good, not because I want to be here, but because I want to solve some problems that really have developed. And problems --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: You inherited.
TRUMP: You know, when I left, we had no wars, we had no inflation, we were riding high. And look at what's happened to our country. And now, we have to get people out of our country that would have never been here.
So, I want to -- I want to do what's best for our country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: And Elizabeth Pipko, when it comes to solving problems, his to do list right now is on fire, breakneck speed.
ELIZABETH PIPKO, FOUNDER, LEST PEOPLE FORGET: It really is. You know, it actually goes back to what Lauren just said. Right? The Democrats completely missed the point. And they didn't just miss the point on immigration. They missed the point on so many other issues. The fact is, they were hiding from the problems in the country because they were too scared to be blamed for them, and didn't have the courage to go up and mention the fact that people were suffering, that they might have some solutions.
Donald Trump went out and was proud to face the American people, face the American public. Tell them -- tell them every single day he understands exactly why they are suffering. What issues have been caused by the government in our country, by the way, not just by Democrat -- presidents, by Republicans, as well. And to promise him that he was going to bring solutions.
Democrats missed the blatant point.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: Yes.
PIPKO: Is that the American people just want solutions to their problems.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Somewhere they lost the plot.
Meantime, Trump releases the assassination files: JFK, RFK, MLK. Chuck Schumer, first, he wrote the following on X. "Now do UFOs."
Anna Paulina Luna statement said, quoting, "Our government, led by corrupt bureaucrats, has hidden this information from the American people for far too long. Americans deserve to know the truth, whether it makes the government look good or not."
What do you think, Lauren? Good idea, bad idea?
(CROSSTALK)
WRIGHT: I don't know what's in these? I don't know what's in these. So, it's hard to say why or why not.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: No, no --
WRIGHT: But it's good to keep campaign promises, and it's good to be transparent.
GALLAGHER: Right.
WRIGHT: And so, definitely, Trump's on the public opinion positive side of this. Yes.
GALLAGHER: Are you interested on what --
(CROSSTALK)
WRIGHT: Of course. Of course, I'm an interest -- I'm as interested as anyone else, and I think there is a way to release all the information and protect the crucial, very private security-oriented names and such.
GALLAGHER: So, Trump goes to the World Economic Forum, Elizabeth Pipko, and he stands up to the -- to the men in Davos -- men and women in Davos. Here is part of that. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: As you probably know, by just reading any paper, my message to every business in the world is very simple, come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth.
But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Yes, I say he went. He didn't go. He zoomed in from Washington, D.C. But he set the tone and the tenor of that forum.
PIPKO: He did. Isn't it such a mystery, Trace? How the man who stood up for the United States of America ended up be a president again, right? It's so crazy to me that people didn't see this coming when one candidate -- by the way, vice president as well, maybe even entire party, has hid from the idea of defending our nation for so many elections now, and then another man comes out and said it's going to be America first and the American people first. That's why he won. That's why he is going to keep winning for the next four years.
GALLAGHER: Yes, it's kind of amazing. Elizabeth Pipko, Lauren Wright, thank you both for coming on.
WRIGHT: You got it.
GALLAGHER: Well, the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT "COMMON SENSE. DEPARTMENT" wonders if CNN has finally decided that trashing Trump 24/7 is bad for business. Turns out CNN boss, Mark Thompson, reportedly had to warn his lead anchors, Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper, and dozens of other journalists, not to, "express outrage" during the Trump inauguration.
"COMMON SENSE" thinks, when you have to order your journalist to be fair, it's bad for journalism. It's bad for business. Maybe that's why CNN's Anti-Trump anchor, Jim Acosta was left off CNN's new programming schedule.
Maybe that's why CNN had to fire hundreds of employees. Maybe that's why CNN is overhauling its lineup.
But here is the weird thing. CNN is changing its lineup, but is not changing its dead last in ratings prime time lineup, and Chief Executive Mark Thompson is now promising to steer CNN away from its reliance on traditional television.
So, CNN is steering clear of television, because the country is steering clear of CNN on television. Seems short sighted. Like selling tequila, but swearing off bottles.
I mean, it's totally fine to pivot toward the digital future, but presently, people still watch television.
"COMMON SENSE" thinks the former most trusted name in news failed to learn the big lesson of last year's election, which is when all you do is trash Trump, you go the way of Biden-Harris.
Let's bring in the Federalist elections correspondent Brianna Lyman and New York Post reporter, Lydia Moynihan. Great to see you two in person. (INAUDIBLE) great fan.
BRIANNA LYMAN, ELECTIONS CORRESPONDENT, THE FEDERALIST: Great to be here.
GALLAGHER: Thank you for coming on tonight.
CNN, literally kind of moving the deck chairs, Brianna. Right? They are shuffling things around, they don't know what to do, they are thinking of getting out of the T.V. business and going digital. It's kind of a train wreck over there. But, but the whole concept of having to warn your anchors that you need to not be outraged at the inauguration is silly.
LYMAN: Right. Right. This is a purported news network, saying, hey guys, we're going to try to do something crazy. Be journalists, give the unbiased truth.
GALLAGHER: Right.
LYMAN: And what this directive is, it's an admission that CNN has not been acting as journalists for the past decade. They've been acting as propagandists. They took every opportunity they had to malign Donald Trump, to denigrate conservatives and the Republican Party for the past decade, and now they are reaping what they sow. And so, they are trying to backpedal and pretend like they have some kind of credibility they can save. They have no credibility.
Stranger things have happened, but I'm not hopeful.
GALLAGHER: Yes, it's amazing. And by the way, the new President Trump held another news conference today. Here is a little bit of that, Lydia, and we'll get your take on it. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You said that Ukraine is ready to make a deal. Did President Zelenskyy tell you that personally?
TRUMP: Yes, sure. He is ready to negotiate a deal.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you expect the Fed to listen to you?
TRUMP: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you going to talk to Powell about this -- and bringing the rates down?
TRUMP: At the right time, I will.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does it bother you that Elon Musk criticized a deal that you made publicly, that he said that -- he tweeted that?
TRUMP: No, he hates one of the people in the deal.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: I mean, he will answer anything from anyone. It's kind of a novel concept, right?
LYDIA MOYNIHAN, REPORTER, NEW YORK POST: I'm old enough to remember when Biden would get on stage very, very rarely. This would happen maybe once a year, with the note card so he could know what questions were going to be asked of him. And here, I mean, you see, President Trump is clearly just made for this job. He can, at any moment, discuss anything from foreign policy to artificial intelligence to TikTok. He doesn't know what they are going to throw at him.
And bear in mind, this is a press corps that's been very adversarial to him. They are asking him challenging questions. They kind of want to trip him up. And he is so confident in these issues. He knows these issues so thoroughly. He knows what he's doing so thoroughly.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: Yes.
MOYNIHAN: That he can really speak to anything. Oftentimes, while he is literally signing executive order.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Confidence is just way up with the sky high.
Meantime, Ana Navarro, the woman on "The View", has got -- he's got the whole DEI policy ending thing a little bit backwards. Here is what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANA NAVARRO, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN: I would love to think that there is no racism by the people who do hirings in the government and in corporations in America, but that is not the case. I would love to think that there is no homophobia, but that is not the case. And I think that by getting rid of this and doing it in such a bold way on day one, what he is doing is giving a green light to people who are racist, to people who are homophobic.
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW, ABC: Right. Yes.
NAVARRO: To people who are anti-women.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: She is missing it, because it has nothing to do with racism or homophobia. It has to do with equality and rights. It's what Martin Luther King, Jr. said, is that everybody should be treated equally. That's what they fought for. That's what they got. Now, they want to change it.
LYMAN: Right. Donald Trump, Martin Luther King, everybody they want a Martin Luther King, Jr. They want a meritocracy, right? And Joe Biden was on "The View" recently, and he said -- and Ana Navarro applauded him. She said, you chose Kamala Harris, the first V.P., who is a woman.
Yes, she checked off a DEI box. But because of that DEI box being checked off, the United States saw four years of just constant decline, record high inflation, record high illegal border crossings, record high crime levels, and so, she wants that to be the blueprint for the government going forward. Does she not see how disastrous it already was?
GALLAGHER: I don't -- I don't think she does.
LYMAN: I don't think she does. Yes.
GALLAGHER: That's the answer, is I don't think she does.
Lydia, James Carville said this about his old friend, Joe Biden. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: You had a noble career. Your last act was terrible. Just get out of the way. The party is moving on.
He created this himself. Does he have nobody to blame but himself.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: We didn't play the first 15-20 seconds. I mean, it was scathing. It was scathing, and it feels like there is this bitterness built up among Democrats, and they can't let it go.
MOYNIHAN: Oh, they have -- they have turned on him. Remember when the talking point for a few months was that he was noble, he was stepping down?
GALLAGHER: Right, right.
MOYNIHAN: Now, he has completely lost power, he is gone for good. And so, people are saying what they really think. David Axelrod, also making pretty scathing comments.
And so, it's the Democrats who are kind of eating their own here. And I think they are right. You know, they are criticizing him for pardoning his family, his son, going back on promises that he'd already made. But I think the issues that they are facing are so much deeper than Joe Biden, right?
If it was just him, it would be fine, but this is an entire party that's in disarray without a leader. It's easy to blame the guy who's now gone for good, but it doesn't seem like there is much of a plan forward.
GALLAGHER: Yes. I mean, it's a great point, because if -- you can't be -- he is gone, you can't be mad at him. You clearly are mad at the whole system, because you've got a lot of fixing to do before you can get somebody back in his position.
Lydia, Brianna, thank you.
LYMAN: Thank you, Trace.
WRIGHT: So glad to be here.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I did something important, but what they did is they were protesting a crooked election. Yes, I mean, people understand that also, and they were treated very badly. Nobody is been treated like that.
So, I'd be open to it. Certainly, I don't know of anything like that, but I think they are going to meeting some of the Congress people, Congressmen women, want to -- want to meet.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)?
TRUMP: But I'd certainly be open to --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Let's bring in former L.A. GOP vice chair and Daily Wire actor. Siaka Massaquoi. I think Jonathan is talking to you. But can you hear me, Siaka?
SIAKA MASSAQUOI, GOP VICE CHAIR, LOS ANGELES COUNTY: Yes, sir. I can hear you loud and clear, Trace. Thank you.
GALLAGHER: Thank you for coming. I'm doing well. Thank you, sir for coming on.
MASSAQUOI: Yes.
GALLAGHER: We just want to go over this, Siaka, because you were charged with four misdemeanors of the January 6th thing, quiet skies, you were put on that list.
(CROSSTALK)
MASSAQUOI: Yes.
GALLAGHER: You court -- your court date was this week, Siaka.
MASSAQUOI: Yes.
GALLAGHER: Now, you're free. Your thing. What do you think of these pardons?
MASSAQUOI: I think they're a long time coming, Trace. I think that what so many of us have gone through has been nothing but disastrous and just cold hearted by the former Biden regime.
And, you know, today is my birthday, so, I like to say it feels so great to be 45 and free today.
GALLAGHER: That's amazing.
Siaka, happy birthday to you.
MASSAQUOI: Thank you.
GALLAGHER: Jonathan Turley said this about the J6 prosecutors. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: The justice department unleashed what one of its top lawyers called a shock and awe campaign, and they just scooped up hundreds of people. They often demanded really excessive senses, in my view.
Most of these people were charged with just trespass or unlawful entry. Most of them were not violent.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Yes. Is he right, Siaka?
MASSAQUOI: A hundred percent, Trace. A hundred percent. I mean, even with my case, all I did was walk onto the grounds, I took a selfie and videotaped into the entrance, a step like two to three feet inside of an entrance for 71 seconds.
I was raided by the FBI in '21 not even arrested. Quiet Skies list for 2- 1/2 years. And then, arrested on the tarmac at Burbank Airport, ripped away from my 7-month-old wife -- seven-month pregnant wife at the time, and found out I was only being charged with four misdemeanors. For all that effort, all that wasted money, all that manpower, it was just so excessive. It was a shock, and now, they were trying to break the American people.
GALLAGHER: Yes. But Peggy Noonan, on the flip side of this, has the following to say, Siaka.
"Conservatives are tough on crime because of the pain and disorder it causes. In that case, it pained an entire nation. January 6 too shamed us in the eyes of the world. This pardon was not a patriotic act." Does she have a point? What would you say to her, Siaka?
MASSAQUOI: No, she doesn't have a point. I've seen footage myself of many people being set up by the Capitol police and the D.C. police that were -- that was there.
I find it very hilarious that we don't talk about the individuals responsible for security there, and how in the heck a place who -- that's seen as one of the most secure areas in the world had such a huge security breach to have people able to walk in a wide-open door, just like I did.
How come no one's talking about who's supposed to watch that? And that is Nancy Pelosi, but yet, individuals who were attacked first, many of them were shot with, you know, rubber bullets without just standing around. Two men died of heart attacks that day that they are never talked about.
A woman, Rosanne Boyland was trampled and beaten over the head, over and over by, you know, Capitol police that she end-up dying that day, along with Ashli Babbitt.
And so, when these people talk about, oh, it's a -- it's a scar on our country, when they look and find out the honey pot that was created by our own government, we should be sick. That will be the embarrassment that everyone needs to see.
GALLAGHER: Siaka Massaquoi, great to have you on. Thank you, sir.
MASSAQUOI: Thank you, brother. As always.
GALLAGHER: Well, coming up, more California residents facing evacuation orders tonight, as firefighters battle new fires.
And later in the "NIGHTCAP", Donald Trump, signing an executive order to release more JFK and MLK assassination files. What do you think? Is it a good idea? A bad idea? And would you be interested, maybe fascinated in what they have to say?
Let us know, X and Instagram @tracegallagher. We will read your responses coming up in the "NIGHTCAP".
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GALLAGHER: Well, breaking tonight, the red flag wildfire warnings continue throughout parts of Southern California tonight, as the new brush fire ignites now in Ventura County.
Christina Coleman is live with the latest rundown of the fires. Christina, good evening.
CHRISTINA COLEMAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, good evening, Trace.
A fast-moving brush fire broke out today in Ventura County, forcing the evacuation of the university campus of Cal State Channel Islands in Camarillo. This fire, the Laguna fire, is now 70 percent contained. The evacuation order was downgraded to a warning, after crews gained ground on the flames.
A fire also broke out near the famed Getty Center off the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, overnight, scorching about 45 acres. That fire is now 60 percent contained. Crews made progress on that fire very quickly.
Meantime, gusty Santa Ana winds continue to fuel the large, Hughes Fire, burning about 40 miles north of Los Angeles. It scorched more than 10,300 acres and forced tens of thousands of residents to evacuate and jump into action.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And ashes are falling everywhere. My neighbors, they got the sprinklers going on, they water down the house. Want to make sure the family is good right now.
COLEMAN (voice over): The Hughes Fire is now 36 percent contained. Cal Fire says the coordinated ground and air attack kept it from spreading even further after it started yesterday morning.
BRENT PASCUA, CHIEF, CAL FIRE BATTALION: I was up in an area where it initially started, and we were -- we had to get into a safety zone because it was just jumping the roads and cutting off our escape routes. So, extremely dangerous, especially in the beginning stages of this fire.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COLEMAN (on camera): Also, most of Los Angeles and Ventura counties are still under a red flag warning for critical fire risk until tomorrow morning. Trace?
GALLAGHER: Christina Coleman, live for us in Los Angeles. Christina, thank you.
Let's bring in California GOP associate delegate and L.A. GOP Central Committee member Elizabeth Barcohana, along with California State Assembly member Carl DeMaio. Thank you both for coming on.
Elizabeth, here are parts of your speech. This is what you said at a neighborhood council meeting. We have the sound. Let's play it right now.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELIZABETH BARCOHANA, ASSOCIATE DELEGATE, LOS ANGELES COUNTY GOP CENTRAL COMMITTEE: We all live here. We know that you haven't. We've -- the speaker after speaker has come here tonight begging you to do clearance around here. And your response is, we can't make any promises, we're not going to clear the acreage, the -- it's not good for the environment, and we live in a fire zone.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: It's astonishing to me, because you -- the sound bite was longer, Elizabeth, but the whole theme here was, is that, you know, these officials will refuse to clear any brush.
BARCOHANA: Yes, we've had residents that live in our area for decades and they remember every year when someone would come and clear the brush, the dead brush. And about 10 years ago, they started slowing that down and then it completely stopped.
And you know, you just played footage of a fire, you know, that broke out on that very hillside an hour after that meeting, where resident after resident was coming to beg the officials that were there. There were representatives from our city council members' offices and Supervisor Horvath's office, as well as representatives from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which is the big swath of land that they're not clearing, and they told us in the meeting that they were which is what really set me over the edge because we know that they're not.
GALLAGHER: Yes, and it's been devastating to a lot of homes and a lot of families.
Carl, to you now, you know the president is coming out to California tomorrow, you believe the president should tie any aid to California to changing the policies of fire management in the state of California, explain that.
CARL DEMAIO, REFORM CALIFORNIA CHAIRMAN: Well, unless we change the policies of the negligent approach that California liberal politicians have brought to our state on fire management, these disasters are going to continue to happen, more losses more homes lost more lives lost, and so we release a plan this week called prevent, respond, and rebuild. It's a comprehensive plan to fireproof California under prevent it gets exactly what Elizabeth talked about.
Let homeowners have a right to clear defensible space and require the government do its job on public lands. Second, under respond, we need to make sure we have the water and the firefighters staffing in place to respond to fires. And third, look there's a reason why the same house costs three times the amount of money in Texas, in California to build than in Texas.
California's insane regulations and insane building code will mean that these homeowners that have lost everything, many of them will not be able to afford to rebuild. We've got to slash those regulations. We got to do the prevent, respond, and rebuild plan if we are going to have any chance of recovery.
GALLAGHER: Very quickly, I got to go through this. The director of a group called Food and Water Watch said the following, quoting here: "If Trump is truly interested in supporting Angeleno's, he should start by accepting the climate change is the real, is real instead of rolling back our country's climate policies and doubling down on his support of the fossil fuel industry, whose rampant pollution helps to create the perfect conditions for these mega disasters in the first place."
Climate change didn't do all this, what you're seeing to the Palisades and so on. Elizabeth, I've got about 20 seconds for you to answer this.
BARCOHANA: Climate change didn't take four hours to get to the fire or eight hours to call in the off-duty officers or a day to bring in the Northern California firefighters, or two days to call in the National Guard. This narrative is false. And it is designed to avoid accountability at the ballot box and liability because they're all getting sued.
GALLAGHER: Carl.
DEMAIO: Well, look, it's, it's not climate change when you don't allow people to clear defensible space. It's not climate change when the water is not there and the hydrants. It's certainly not climate change when you charge someone three times to rebuild their home such that they can't afford it.
California Democrats today voted down a billion dollars to clear the brush from a lot more communities to prevent the loss of these homes. They are showing very clearly they don't give a damn about the victims of these fires and more fires are going to start hurting more people.
GALLAGHER: It is astonishing. Carl, Elizabeth, thank you both. Coming up, the executive order that one federal judge calls blatantly unconstitutional and the upcoming court battle. And what does Washington, D.C., think about President Trump saying bye-bye DEI?
Our FOX NEWS @ NIGHT crew doing some research tonight in the nation's capital what we found out is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GALLAGHER: Well, a federal judge ruling against one of the president's executive orders tonight. Now, the White House, Congress, and the courts and immigration advocates are all gearing up for a fight over Trump's desire to redefine birthright citizenship. Correspondent and Attorney, Chanley Painter is live with the legal details on this. Chanley, good evening.
CHANLEY PAINTER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good evening, Trace. So, a federal judge in Seattle today wasting no time indicating how he feels about Trump's ban on birthright citizenship, saying this, "I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case that presented a question as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order."
The judge granting a temporary restraining order requested by four Democrat-led states who filed suit earlier this week challenging the birthright ban as a violation of the 14th Amendment, which the federal government has long interpreted to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth. Their lawsuit is just one of several filed this week on the issue, including another one from a coalition of 18 Democrat states suing Trump.
If Trump's order is eventually allowed to take effect, babies born to illegal immigrants or those who were here legally but on a non-immigrant visa would not be citizens by birthright. So, now the fight continues from all sides. The DOJ attorney's responding with this, "The Department of Justice will vigorously defend President Trump's E.O. which correctly interprets the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court.
And Trace, this temporary block is just one of first many steps of a long- drawn-out legal process that will likely and possibly end up in front of the Supreme Court.
GALLAGHER: What's your guess? Yes, or no?
PAINTER: I think it eventually will because there really hasn't been a clear precedent on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment.
GALLAGHER: Fair assessment. Chandly, thank you. Well, Jillie and the Doge police back on the streets tonight. You can see the animation. Talking to D.C. residents a lot more angry at President Trump for dismantling DEI until they found out just how much they were paying for it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump just got rid of DEI and all of D.C. He said bye, bye DEI. What are your thoughts?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No comment. I think it pretty much goes against everything that we should be believing as a country.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, for me as a foreigner, I think it's nuts.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I actually think it's a beautiful thing.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's not being clear on what he means by shutting down DEI.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a monster who has already destroyed valuable aspects of our country and is going to stand down for the next four years doing more.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, you do not support him getting rid of DEI?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How much do you think Joe Biden spent total on DEI initiatives throughout his presidency? What do you think about the billions and billions and trillions of dollars that have gone into these DEI programs throughout just the past four years with President Biden? Do you think now that it's gone, taxpayers might have a little more money in their wallets?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has there been a lot to show for it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know. I would be interested to see what the data shows.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd say about maybe $400.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Higher. What do you think about the billions and billions and billions of dollars that are going towards these DEI programs?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correction, trillions.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trillions.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trillions.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think it might put a little more money in the taxpayers' wallet?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it's going to put more money in the people that were here, what, two days ago for his inauguration?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: $500?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Higher.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it probably goes to good use.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: $1 million?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Higher.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: $2 million?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Higher.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three million?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joe Biden spent one billion dollars on DEI federal contracts just in the last year.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sleepy Joe.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Honestly, we have such a large budget and I feel like I would be interested to know what Trump would be interested in spending that on, if you know at all.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Perhaps securing our southern border. Do you say bye- bye DEI?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Much higher. For more, let's bring in Gun Owners of America Federal Affairs Director, Aidan Johnston; and the host of the "Robbie Starbuck Show," filmmaker, Robbie Starbuck. Thank you both.
Robbie, to you first. You posted this on X: "Big news, an NSA whistleblower has alerted me that the NSA is attempting to hide their DEI program by renaming it the Equal Employment Opportunity and Accessibility Group. As you can see, the training is the same and within it you find DEIA as tradecraft." That's the banner that was later on and by the way this has now been taken down Robbie what what's your thought on this?
ROBBIE STARBUCK, FILMMAKER: Well, I think, Trace, this is something we're seeing across many agencies is an attempt to burrow DEI in under many different names because, frankly, they're trying to save it. They know how important this is to the left-wing ideology and its survival.
And I think the Trump administration also knows how important it is, and it's why it was one of the first orders of business to get rid of it. And I think they're going to be very unpleasantly surprised when they realize how quickly we've figured out all the schemes to try to hide it.
GALLAGHER: Yes, if you have this, Kate, in the Daily Caller, write the follow-up, I'm going to play that next, but to you, Aidan, your belief is that ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is trying to hide its DEI programs as well. Explain that for us.
AIDAN JOHNSTON, GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA FEDERAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: That's correct, Trace. So, we caught the ATF giving their chief diversity officer a title change. They now want to refer to her as a senior executive and keep her on. And of course, President Trump said that all DEI employees had to go on paid administrative leave as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, but ATF has not complied.
This is a rogue federal agency. They're not going to listen to President Trump about DEI. They don't listen to the Constitution when it comes to the Second Amendment. And I think the only thing left here is to just abolish this rogue, tyrannical, and woke federal agency.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Meantime, the Daily Caller, that thing that was up on the screen, I want to put it back up on the screen now for you, Robbie, because the Daily Caller writes the following here: "Customs Border Protection renamed their diversity and inclusion web page to Special Emphasis Program at some point between January 21 and the early morning of January 23, according to Web Archives." Change the name. If you get caught, you just take it down, Robbie.
STARBUCK: You know what's beautiful? Is that these people are actually helping us identify who's behind this beast. And I think you're going to see very quickly a lot of moves made to remove these people from service, so they're no longer in the federal government.
It's not the easiest thing to do but President Trump doesn't do easy. I think we're going to do the hard things that are necessary to get rid of these people. Because ultimately, I see this a national security concern. If you have these people in government and they are directly disobeying the orders of the president, that's taint amount to treason.
I think that's a direct threat to our security as a nation not only because we're hiring people who are not fit for the job through DEI, but because you've got a group of people in the federal government who are directly disobeying the president on purpose.
GALLAGHER: Yes, it really is. Now, the ATF chief diversity officer apparently, Aidan, got a title change, right? So, maybe we can put this on the screen? ATF chief diversity officer that's the first one. Lisa Boykin and then you see over there that the title is a senior executive. This also has been taken down, Aidan.
JOHNSTON: Yes, this agency is just never going to listen. In the last days of the Trump administration, they actually initiated a ban on millions of pistol-braced guns without the president's approval and the White House had to walk it back.
Now, here in the first days of his new administration, they're ignoring his executive order on DEI. That's why JD Vance and Elon Musk are all asking the question, should the ATF even exist? And the answer is no, it needs to be abolished.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Aidan Johnston, Robbie Starbuck, thank you both.
JOHNSTON: Thank you.
GALLAGHER: Meantime, President Trump signing an executive order to release more JFK, RFK and MLK assassination files.
What do you think? Good idea? Bad idea? Would you be interested in what they have to say? Would you take a look? Are you fascinated? Let us know, X and Instagram, @TraceGallagher. We'll read your responses. Coming up, in the "NIGHTCAP."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GALLAGHER: We're back with the "NIGHTCAP" crew: Kevin Corke, Christina Coleman, Chanley Painter, Lauren Wright, Lydia Moynihan, Elizabeth Pipko, and Siaka Massaquoi. A little time, fast answers.
Tonight's topic, secrets revealed. President Trump signing an executive order to release more JFK and MLK assassination files. Good idea, bad idea? Would you be interested, Kevin Corke?
CORKE: Yes, and I think it'll be a little less exciting than people may think, but I can't wait.
GALLAGHER: Oh, Siaka Massaquoi, I'm the same way as Kevin. I think, you know what, bring them on. I'm going to read every word and figure out what's going on.
MASSAQUOI: Yes, I think, you know, transparency is going to help heal this country. Let's see what we got.
GALLAGHER: Yes, I agree. Christina Coleman.
COLEMAN: I think it's a great idea. I'm super interested. The more transparency, the better.
GALLAGHER: Well, now the answers don't have to be that short. Elizabeth Pipko, what do you think?
PIPKO: Be careful what you wish for, Trace.
GALLAGHER: I know, I know, right.
PIPKO: No, I'll just say, look, faith in our major institutions in this country are at an all-time low, so I think it's a really important first step in the right direction to solve that. And look, this is actually the reason so many people from the left cross over to vote for President Trump. It's for actions like this.
GALLAGHER: Yes, it really is. Lydia Moynihan.
MOYNIHAN: I mean, conspiracy theories run rampant when you don't have any sort of transparency, so I think it's going to be great. Let's see what's actually in these files, and it's, I mean, it's been long enough, right? It's been about 60 years.
GALLAGHER: Right, right.
MOYNIHAN: So, even if there is something problematic in there, that person will not be employed by the government anymore, but I think we should go a step further I want to know what happened at 9-11.
GALLAGHER: I want the UFO files, Lauren.
WRIGHT: Yes. The National Archives, they keep saying we know 97 percent of these files are out there, so I think the three percent will be disappointing to the conspiracy theorists, I'm sorry to say.
MOYNIHAN: Maybe they call the interesting stuff.
WRIGHT: Interesting nonetheless, absolutely, absolutely. I'll be reading them.
GALLAGHER: Chanley Painter.
PAINTER: I'm with the panel. I agree wholeheartedly. I can't wait to read them.
GALLAGHER: Really? But earlier, Lauren, saying in fairness, she said, yes, but we should keep some of that stuff sealed.
WRIGHT: If there's a name. Names of people, yes, probably. Maybe people that are still active.
GALLAGHER: Eye says, "Long overdue, let the truth be told no matter what it is, it's time to put an end to this mystery."
Graceland says, "It's been decades, time to put the questions surrounding all three assassinations to rest."
Miz, "I'd be interested in the JFK and RFK, I just don't think they'll have much information and anything important will be redacted."
Dave says, "Bro is crushing it on every level. We love the transparency and the authenticity." I guess bro is Trump.
Josh, "It's going to open a can of worms the Democrats don't want."
Dana says, "I think it's past time. The more they try to keep it secret, the bigger the conspiracy."
Tommy says, "I'm interested but concerned what's in these documents. We might not like what we find."
Cindy, "We have been waiting for years. Bring them on. Thank you for watching America's late news, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. I'm Trace Gallagher. Good night.
