Senator Schmitt, Congressman Cloud Introduce the Dismantle DEI Act
WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Eric Schmitt and Congressman Michael Cloud introduced the Dismantle DEI Act, which would codify President Trump's executive actions on terminating DEI programs and initiatives into law, thereby preventing future administrations from reinstating similar Biden-era DEI policies.
"DEI has plagued our federal government, academic institutions, and other aspects of our society for far too long, all while disregarding merit in the process. America is the greatest meritocracy the world has ever seen, and no taxpayer dollars should be wasted on funding this divisive ideology which undercuts the values our country was founded on. President Trump understands that these programs have absolutely no business in the federal government, and I am proud to introduce this critical legislation with Congressman Cloud that will save taxpayer dollars and put a stop to this DEI madness," said Senator Eric Schmitt.
BACKGROUND:
* On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, "Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing." This executive action terminates diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and initiatives throughout all federal departments and agencies, while also compiling a list of those federal contractors and grantees associated with those same programs.
* President Trump helped reverse many of the Biden administration's prior executive actions on DEI programs.
The Dismantle DEI Act helps build on the President's agenda by:
* Ensuring all DEI offices are terminated and prohibiting agencies from renaming or repurposing them to continue the same functions under new titles.
* Barring federal funds from being used for DEI training, grants, or programs--including identity-based quotas and critical race theory.
* Granting individuals the legal right to challenge any of these violations in court.
* Senators Cotton, Lankford, Daines, Tuberville, Blackburn, Marshall, Lummis, Cassidy, Risch, Cramer, Banks, Sheehy, Hyde-Smith, Rick Scott, Lee, Crapo, Johnson, Budd, and Hawley joined Senator Schmitt in introducing this legislation.
