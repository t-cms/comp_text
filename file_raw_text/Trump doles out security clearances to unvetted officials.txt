Donald Trump is granting security clearances to new White House officials before they have completed the vetting process, according to reports.
The US President claimed he was forced to issue temporary, six-month clearances because of a backlog left by his predecessor, Joe Biden.
However, critics warned that the move could prompt the US’ allies to limit the intelligence they share over fears about unvetted officials putting their sources in danger.
One former official told CNN that skipping the security clearance process was “stupid”, adding: “It’s such a dangerous thing.”
The FBI is working to clear hundreds of applications, which figures briefed on the matter told the broadcaster that it was partly caused by the Trump transition team dragging their feet before giving it the green light to start work.

                     Today’s top stories                   
Donald Trump has wasted no time since he returned to the White House with a storm of executive orders and directions for his new government. 
Here are the top stories from the first full day of his second term:
                                            Donald Trump   and companies in a row over “discriminatory” levies on US businesses                       A bishop   during an inauguration church service attended by the president and his family                       John Bolton has   after Trump removed his Secret Service protection within hours of taking office                       The first woman to lead a branch of the US Armed Forces   for excessively focusing on diversity policies while neglecting border security                       The president is   following pressure from an Elon Musk lobbyist, according to reports                       Elon Musk has been accused by Olaf Scholz of “supporting extreme Right positions” after   at an inauguration event                       Volodymyr Zelensky   Trump will ignore them if the continent doesn’t take better care of its own defences                                            Plus:                                                                22 Jan 2025-02:49AM GMT                                          All federal diversity staff to be put on leave                     Donald Trump’s administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave while agencies develop plans to lay them off, according to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management.The memo follows an executive order that Mr Trump signed on Monday ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government’s diversity and inclusion programs.22 Jan 2025-02:33AM GMTMore allegations against Pete HegsethSenators vetting the nomination of Pete Hegseth for Defence Secretary have received an affidavit from his former sister-in-law alleging that the former Fox News host was abusive to his second wife.Mr Hegseth denies the allegations.Danielle Hegseth, who was previously married to the nominee’s brother, said in an affidavit obtained by The Associated Press that Mr Hegseth was often drunk at home and that his former wife Samantha had become so concerned for her safety that she had contacted her with an agreed ‘safe word’. “I have chosen to come forward publicly, at significant personal sacrifice, because I am deeply concerned by what Hegseth’s confirmation would mean for our military and our country,” Ms Hegseth said.Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Mr Hegseth, vehemently denied the allegations, saying the “belated claims” were from an ex-relative with “an axe to grind”. “Sam has never alleged that there was any abuse, she signed court documents acknowledging that there was no abuse and recently reaffirmed the same during her FBI interview,” Mr Parlatore said in a statement.Mr Hegseth has previously denied allegations of sexual assault, excessive alcohol use and financial mismanagement. In November, it emerged that his own mother had  22 Jan 2025-02:02AM GMTFiring Coast Guard boss labelled ‘reckless’Democratic Congressman Rick Larsen said the Trump administration’s decision to remove US Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Linda Lee Fagan was “misguided and will hurt readiness.”“The women and men of the US Coast Guard deserve better than reckless personnel decisions,” Mr Larsen said.The Coast Guard has been under scrutiny for sexual assault since a media report alleged it covered up decades of abuse and a Senate subcommittee found it shamed victims and failed to deal with perpetrators.More than a dozen former US Coast Guard Academy students who say they were victims of sexual assault in the past filed complaints last year seeking $130 million in damages. The Coast Guard has also faced scrutiny in the past over allegations of racism and hazing.Adml Fagan was appointed to the role in 2022. She has been accused by Republicans of having an “excessive” focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies during her time in leadership. 22 Jan 2025-12:32AM GMTTrump: Bolton had ‘enough time’ with Secret Service protectionDonald Trump has defended removing John Bolton’s Secret Service protection, claiming it had been “enough time” and that “we’re not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives”.“I thought he was a very dumb person, but I used him well,” Mr Trump said of his former national security adviser.22 Jan 2025-12:30AM GMTTrump has given Iran an invitation to kill me, says John BoltonJohn Bolton has said he is at risk of attack by Iran after Donald Trump removed his Secret Service protection within hours of taking office.The former national security adviser, who has become a vocal critic of the president since leaving his first administration in 2019, said the “inescapable conclusion” was that he would now be targeted by hostile states.Mr Bolton told The Telegraph that he was given just 12 hours’ notice before his Secret Service detail was terminated by Mr Trump.Read the full story from Tony Diver, our US Editor, . 22 Jan 2025-12:21AM GMTTrump open to Musk buying TikTokDonald Trump has said he is open to Elon Musk buying TikTok to keep the social media platform running.Asked by reporters in the White House if he would support the billionaire owner of acquiring the app, Mr Trump responded: “I would be.”The US President added that he had met with TikTok’s owners and outlined a deal that could see its net worth reach a “trillion dollars” if it sold half its stake to the US.22 Jan 2025-12:13AM GMTTrump defends mass Jan 6 pardonsDonald Trump has defended issuing mass pardons to 1,500 Jan 6 rioters on his first day in office.“They served years in jail... and murderers don’t even go to jail in this country,” he told reporters in the White House.“These people have served years of jail their lives have been ruined... If you look at the American public, the American public is tired of it. Take a look at the election.”22 Jan 2025-12:07AM GMTTrump and Vance ambushed by bishop pleading for mercy on trans childrenA bishop urged Donald Trump to “have mercy” on transgender children and immigrants during an inauguration church service attended by the president and his family.The Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, delivered the sermon at a prayer service attended by the newly appointed president, vice president, as well as members of their families.Directly addressing Mr Trump who was sitting in the front pew, the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde said: “In the Name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.“There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families. Some who fear for their lives.”Rev. Budde urged the president to show the same compassion to illegal migrants, who he intends to deport in large numbers.21 Jan 2025-11:45PM GMTJan 6 shaman says he’ll buy guns after Trump pardonsThe shaman who stormed the US Capitol four years ago has said he intends to buy guns after being pardoned by Donald Trump.Jacob Chansley, who was pictured at the Jan 6 riots with a six-foot spear, wearing a horned helmet and body paint, wrote on social media: “I just got the news from my lawyer.... I got a pardon baby! Thank you President Trump!!!“Now I am gonna buy some mothaf----in guns!!! I love this country!!! God bless America!!!”Under federal law, convicted felons are generally prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. Chansley pleaded guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding in a plea deal with prosecutors.21 Jan 2025-11:28PM GMTWashington prison vigil turns into MAGA rally as Jan 6 rioters are freedTwo years ago, William Sarsfield was arrested by the FBI, detained and convicted of felony and misdemeanour charges for his role in the Capitol riot of Jan 6.But after Donald Trump’s sweeping pardon of more than 1,500 men and women charged with joining the insurrection, he now stands a free man, albeit still wearing prison-issued sweatpants.“When I looked out the window and saw my girlfriend, my truck with the flag in the back, sitting on the side of the road with a bunch of other people that were there to pick us up, it was all part of God’s plan and healing,” he said outside the Washington DC Central Detention Facility.Read the full story from Connor Stringer, our Deputy US Editor, . 21 Jan 2025-10:53PM GMTJohnson ‘has not reviewed’ Trump Jan 6 pardonsMike Johnson, the House of Representatives speaker, claimed he had not “reviewed” Donald Trump’s mass pardon of Jan 6 rioters when pressed by reporters.Mr Johnson, a prominent ally of Mr Trump’s in Congress, said on Sunday that “violent criminals” should not be given clemency by the new President. Among those pardoned the following day were dozens of people convicted of assaulting police officers with pepper spray, batons and other weapons.“I haven’t had an opportunity to review that because I’ve been so busy, so I’ll get back to you” he said, according to CNN.Mr Johnson added: “It’s a case-by-case evaluation as I’ve always said and I haven’t had a chance to review it.”21 Jan 2025-10:39PM GMTTrump announces $500bn in AI investmentDonald Trump has said he wants to beat China on artificial intelligence (AI) development as he announced $500bn in private investment into the technology.The US President said Stargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, would build “colossal data centres”, creating 100,000 jobs in the process.“It will ensure the future of technology. What we want to do is keep it in this country, China is a competitor, and others are competitors,” Mr Trump said, calling the investment “a resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential under a new president”.The Republican added that he would help with “emergency declarations” because “we have to get this stuff built”, but did not elaborate on the specifics.21 Jan 2025-09:42PM GMTTrump told to speed up release of Jan 6 riotersIn Washington, there is still no sign of the Capitol rioters being released.Representative Lauren Boebert has called on President Trump to intervene to speed up the process.“We need to make sure this doesn’t become a paperwork issue. These men have already paid too much time, more time than they ever should.”21 Jan 2025-09:23PM GMTRubio tells diplomats to eliminate diversity programmesMarco Rubio has told diplomats he will eliminate DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) from the State Department and restore “strict meritocracy”.“There is tremendous talent and expertise in this Department — I have seen it first-hand in missions across the globe — and upholding strict meritocracy is essential to securing our nation’s future,” Mr Rubio, who was confirmed as Secretary of State yesterday, said in a memo to the diplomatic corps.He added that he would follow Donald Trump’s executive order to ban diversity programmes “in both letter and spirit”, and that his new department must stop “pushing political and cultural causes that are divisive at home and deeply unpopular abroad”.Mr Rubio also declared that “the era of mass migration must end” and that he would prioritise “energy dominance” over climate change.21 Jan 2025-09:14PM GMTBolton ‘disappointed’ after Trump revokes Secret Service protectionJohn Bolton has said he is “disappointed” that Donald Trump terminated his Secret Service protection despite being targeted for assassination by Iran.Mr Bolton, a former national security adviser to Mr Trump and architect of the US strike on Iranian military officer Qassim Soleimani in 2020, wrote on social media:21 Jan 2025-08:52PM GMTJeffries: Trump pardoned a ‘bloodthirsty mob’Hakeem Jeffries has criticised Donald Trump for issuing pardons to a “bloodthirsty mob” of Jan 6 rioters.“House Republicans are celebrating pardons issued to a bloodthirsty mob that violently assaulted police officers on January 6, 2021. What happened to backing the Blue?” Mr Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives, said in a statement.“Far-Right extremists have become the party of lawlessness and disorder. Don’t ever lecture America again. About anything.”21 Jan 2025-08:46PM GMT‘I’ve got a tough job’, Rubio admitsMarco Rubio went on to say that he had a “tough job” as Secretary of State where he would be faced with working out the “least bad” option.“Oftentimes in foreign policy our choices are not between – are between two – a bad option and a good option,” said Mr Rubio, the first of Donald Trump’s cabinet appointments to be confirmed by the Senate.“Sometimes in foreign relations our options are two bad ones, and we’re just trying to figure out which one of them is least bad. “And that’s unfortunate, but it is true. And that’s a tough job. It’s our job. And we’ll seek to do it right and well.”He said that the state department’s key mission would be “the advancement of our national interest” and making the US safer, stronger, and richer.21 Jan 2025-08:42PM GMTRubio: I’ll stop state department being sidelinedMarco Rubio has declared he will restore the state department’s prestige and stop it being sidelined in his first speech since becoming the US’ chief diplomat.“I have watched from the congressional side from time to time, administrations in both parties, in which sometimes the Department of State has been sort of relegated to a secondary role because some other agency can move faster or seems to be bolder or more creative,” he told employees in Washington, DC.“It’s not your fault, but we’re going to change that.“We want to be at the centrepiece, and we want to be at the core of how we formulate foreign policy, because we’re going to have the best ideas of any agency and because we’re going to execute it better and faster and more effectively than any other agency in our government.”It comes amid suggestions that the array of special envoys appointed by Donald Trump would tangle lines of diplomatic communication and undermine Mr Rubio.21 Jan 2025-08:18PM GMTTrump cancels protection for former national security adviserDonald Trump has reportedly cancelled the Secret Service protection detail for his former national security adviser John Bolton.The order again Mr Bolton, who has repeatedly criticised the president and called him unfit for office, came into effect at midnight on Monday, The Washington Post reported.The former security chief was granted added protection in 2021 by Joe Biden after the FBI uncovered an assassination plot against him.21 Jan 2025-07:20PM GMTProud Boys leader released from jail under Trump’s ordersThe leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys who helped orchestrate the January 6 Capitol riots has been released from prison after being pardoned by Donald Trump.Enrique Tarrio was serving a 22-year prison sentence after being convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in planning the violent protests in 2021.He and Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers militia, who was serving an 18-year prison sentence for his involvement in the riots, are two of the most high-profile January 6 defendants to be granted a reprieve by the new President.It comes after Mr Trump yesterday pardoned 1,500 Jan 6 rioters and commuted the sentences of 14 others who stormed the US Capitol four years ago, including the 169 people who pleaded guilty to assaulting police officers.At a ceremony in the Oval Office, Mr Trump claimed those who had been convicted and charged were “hostages”, having previously referred to the riot as a “day of peace of love”.Patrick Malone, a lawyer representing Capitol Police officers who responded to the riots, described Mr Trump’s decision as an “unspeakable outrage”.“For anyone who cares about truth and respect for law and law enforcement, his pardons are an unspeakable outrage,” he said.Thomas Tillis, a Republican senator, warned that the move raises “legitimate questions” about the safety of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.21 Jan 2025-06:42PM GMTI do not support pardons for violent January 6 rioters, says Republican senatorA Republican senator has spoken out against President Donald Trump’s pardons for violent January 6 defendants.Senator Susan Collins of Maine said: “I do not support pardons given to people who engaged in violence on January 6, including assaulting police officers, or breaking windows to get into the Capitol, for example.”It comes after her Republican colleague Thom Tillis said Mr Trump’s executive order to release convicted rioters raised “legitimate questions” about the safety of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.21 Jan 2025-06:27PM GMTTrump to launch $500 billion AI hub in TexasDonald Trump is poised to announced a $500 billion AI hub based in Texas.Called Stargate, the

states, with additional investors expected to join the venture.21 Jan 2025-06:11PM GMTImmigration officers carrying out ‘targeted enforcement operations’, says new border TsarThe Trump administration is carrying out targeted immigration enforcement operations, the White House borders tsar has said.Tom Homan, a Trump adviser who has been appointed to support his deportation programme, told CNN

needed to be addressed.Mr Homan, told Fox Business on Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will begin large-scale immigration raids today. “They’re going to do it throughout the

Trump administration has reportedly issued guidance to border officials instructing them to call migrants “illegal aliens,” according to US customs and border protection force sources.Border officials

‘excessive diversity focus’Donald Trump has sacked the head of the US coast guard over her excessive focus on diversity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.Linda Lee Fagan, the first female uniformed leader of an Armed Forces branch, was fired by Mr Trump on Tuesday.A homeland security source told Fox News that Ms Fagan’s contract had been terminated owing to an “erosion of trust”, related to her support of DEI policies, failure to address border security threats, to recruit and keep staff and mismanagement in acquisitions.Elon Musk alluded to the sacking on his social media platform, X, but did not explicitly mention Adml Fagan.“Undermining the US military and border security to spend money on racist/sexist DEI nonsense is no longer acceptable,” he said.Mr Trump has vowed to eliminate DEI programmes in federal agencies as part of his efforts to slash government outgoings.Adml Linda Fagan wrote a pride tribute on behalf of the Coast Guard last June encouraging Americans to “live their truth”.In 2023, she claimed diverse teams have “deeper strength of thought” than “homogenous teams” in an interview with Military Families Magazine.Under her leadership, the Coast Guard was accused by lawmakers of having a “present, ongoing and persistent” problem related to sexual harassment claims.The president has wasted no time in dismantling the legacy of the Biden administration, promising to “identify and remove” more than a thousand of his predecessor’s appointees.21 Jan 2025-05:30PM GMTMy road trip through Trump’s AmericaWell, this has been quite the journey. I left London on Jan 9, flew into Denver and then drove 2,400 miles through what some people might call “the real America” – all in time to reach Washington DC for Donald Trump’s inauguration.I drove more miles in a little over a week than I normally manage in the UK in a year.It was an eye opener that explains in some ways why Mr Trump won, and why he won big, sweeping the swing states and also claiming the popular vote, something that the Republican Party has struggled to achieve in previous elections.I started out in Grant County, Nebraska – about a four-hour drive from Denver. I picked the county   the place where 95.9 per cent of those who voted picked Mr Trump over Kamala Harris.Out of 366 people who cast a ballot there, 351 went for Trump and just 15 for Harris.In Hyannis, Grant County’s biggest town (there are only three in an area the size of Surrey), drinkers in the local bar could pretty much identify every local Democrat.Grant County is cattle? country, dominated by vast ranches. There are real cowboys there that rustle cattle while on horseback. I watched a three-year-old child steer his father’s truck while he chucked alfalfa feed to the cattle following behind.The same rancher also shot a coyote in front of my eyes with skilful aim.Grant County is conservative, traditional and remote, and Mr Trump has scored really big numbers across all these little rural counties, which when added together, make for wins in the swing states.I drove through the snow across Nebraska – hundreds of miles and several hours to Topeka, Kansas, where I knocked on the door of Will Pope, a 6ft 5in PhD student, who is, as I write this, still charged with non-violent crimes for his   back on Jan 6 2021.Mr Trump’s win didn’t just mark a turnaround in his fortunes. Will Pope, despite facing trial, was given a VIP ticket by the Trump camp to attend the inauguration. He expects his prosecution to now be dropped while those already convicted – like the next guy I met on this trip, Billy Chrestman, a member of the notorious Proud Boys – will anticipate pardons.Perhaps nothing says more about the difference a Trump win will make than those accused of insurrection now being feted as heroes.Moving on from Kansas, the road trip took me to Branson, Missouri, where four stores dedicated to selling Trump merchandise are thriving in a smallish resort town in the Ozarks.Sadly the store I visited had  by the time I got there.Into Kentucky, I met with a lovely couple – Tonja and Eric Tuttle – packing up for their own long drive to DC. Committed Catholics and conservatives, you could see how much a Trump win meant for them. They speak for much of America.Finally, I arrived out of Trump’s America and into Washington DC, the capital city that stands for a lot of things he hates. The city has been besieged by his Maga faithful these past couple of days and something you never see here – Trump fans in Maga baseball caps – have become prevalent on the streets. The locals seem to have kept away.I watched the inauguration from inside the Capital One Arena, where the crowd cheered every sight of Mr Trump on the giant screens and booed their enemies like Hillary Clinton, who was greeted with chants of “Lock Her Up”.  It has been one heck of a trip in the friendliest of countries, and I’ve loved it. Just one small gripe: god, the coffee is terrible in the gas stations.For more from our foreign reporters, sign up to the 21 Jan 2025-05:18PM GMTScholz criticises Musk for ‘extreme-right positions’ over saluteOlaf Scholz has criticised Elon Musk’s support for “extreme-right positions” after the tech billionaire performed a gesture at an inauguration rally that some have likened to a Nazi salute.“Everyone can say what he wants even if he is a billionaire. What we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions,” the German chancellor told the World Economic Forum when asked about Mr Musk.Mr Musk quickly fired back on his social media platform X, writing above a post about the chancellor’s remarks: “Shame on Oaf Schitz!”The back and forth comes amid a deepening row between the pair after Mr Musk backed Germany’s hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and called Mr Scholz a “fool”.21 Jan 2025-04:58PM GMTEpiscopal Church issues letter opposing Trump’s deportation plansThe Church denomination which runs Washington Cathedral has issued a letter opposing President Donald Trump’s immigration plans.As Mr Trump sat down for today’s service, the church’s top leaders issued the letter challenging his executive orders on the border.“As Christians, our faith is shaped by the biblical story of people whom God led into foreign countries to escape oppression,” the Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop, wrote. “To our siblings who are at risk of deportation or of being separated from those you love, know that your story is our story, and your dignity is inseparable from our own.”21 Jan 2025-04:27PM GMTTrump attends Washington church serviceDonald Trump has taken his seat at Washington National Cathedral for a prayer service taking place this morning.The symbolic service, which has been held since 1933, will focus on national unity instead of the new administration, according to plans released by the cathedral.Later today, Mr Trump is set to meet Republican lawmakers to discuss his legislative agenda, and will also make a “big infrastructure announcement,” his press secretary told reporters.21 Jan 2025-04:11PM GMTCanada could respond with retaliatory tariffs to Trump, suggests TrudeauCanada could respond with retaliatory tariffs to President Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau has suggest.Canada’s outgoing prime minister said “everything is on the table” if Mr Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, in the clearest signal yet the Canada may respond with tariffs of its own.“If the President does choose to proceed with tariffs on Canada, Canada will respond and everything is on the table,” he told reporters.Mr Trudeau’s cabinet have gathered in Quebec to discuss the threat of 25 per cent trade tariffs with the US, which Mr Trump has pledged to introduce within days of returning to The White House. Mr Trudeau, who earlier this month announced his decision to step down as prime minister following a crisis of confidence from within his own party, sought to downplay Mr Trump’s threat as a negotiating tactic.“Donald Trump is, as always, a skilled negotiator and will do what he can to keep his negotiating partners a little bit off balance. We are confident in the facts on the ground,” he said.21 Jan 2025-03:51PM GMTSacked Coast Guard chief claimed diverse teams have ‘deeper strength of thought’Linda Lee Fagan, who has been fired as head of the US Coast Guard, previously claimed that diverse teams perform better.“Diverse work teams outperform homogenous teams,” she said. “They’re just stronger, more resilient, have better perspective and deeper strength of thought.”Adml Fagan was removed from her position over an ‘erosion of trust’, a Homeland source told Fox News, citing her support for diversity, equity and inclusion policy.The US Coast Guard Academy, which trains Coast Guard officers, has also raised eyebrows for its focus on DEI policy.The academy’s DEI plan for 2024-2026 includes plans to assess faculty candidates on “cultural competence [sic] including their diversity, equity and inclusion philosophy”.It comes as Donald Trump pledged to root out DEI politics during his inaugural speech on Monday.21 Jan 2025-03:43PM GMTCoast Guard head served ‘long illustrious career’Linda Lee Fagan served a ‘long and illustrious career’ as the top admiral of the US Coast Guard, a tribute message to service members read.Adml Linda Fagan was removed from her position as the top admiral in the national coast guard this morning by homeland security officialsA message sent out to coastguard members read: “She served a long and illustrious career, and I thank her for her service to our nation.“Admiral Kevin E. Lunday, by operation of law, is now the Acting Commandant of the Coast Guard and assumes all the authority and responsibilities of the office.”21 Jan 2025-02:35PM GMTMarco Rubio sworn into officeMarco Rubio has been sworn into office as secretary of state after becoming the first member of Donald Trump’s cabinet pics to be confirmed.Mr Rubio took the oath of office this morning after the Senate confirmed his appointment on Monday in a unanimous vote.The Republican senator from Florida is among the least controversial of Trump’s nominees, and the vote securing his confirmation passed 99-0.21 Jan 2025-02:28PM GMTWatch: Trump mistakes Spain for BRICS nationPresident Donald Trump has mistaken Spain as a member of the BRICS nation.Responding to a question about Spain’s defence spending, the newly elected president claimed the country was part of the BRICS trading bloc, prompting head scratching in Madrid.BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is an alliance of developing economies. Meanwhile, PIGS, which stands for Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain, stands for the four nations whose economies have previously been condemned as Europe’s basket cases. Mr Trump started his answer by saying “Spain is very low,” referring to its defense expenditures, but quickly veered into threatening to impose costly trade tariffs on the BRICS.“They’re a BRICS nation, Spain. Do you know what a BRICS nation is?
