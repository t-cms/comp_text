BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Remember, if you can't catch us live, set your DVR, 06:00 p.m. in the East, 03:00 p.m. on the West Coast. You never know which world leader will show up here on Special Report. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this Special Report. Fair, balanced and unafraid. The Ingraham Angle is now.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. We have a lot to tell you about later in the show. Big announcement. But first, celebrating, not denigrating. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.
Now this is the start of week six of President Trump's second term, and the best way to describe the policy so far, unabashedly pro-American.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM HOMAN, BORDER CZAR: We got one badass president now who's going to come in, he's going to take care of this border.
J.D. VANCE (R), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: The fundamental goal is, we want your children and grandchildren to be able to raise a family in security and comfort in the country that we all love.
PAM BONDI (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL: He gave us a clear directive, make America safe, and that's what we're going to do.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're at a level. I don't think we've been at this level maybe ever as the Republican Party. We're a bigger, better, stronger party than ever before, more people in our party than ever before, but the people have given us a resounding mandate for dramatic change in Washington, and we are going to deliver it. We're going to use it, and we're going to Make America Great Again by using it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And he got a resounding reception at CPAC over the weekend, and our friend and pollster Mark Penn, he released a big survey today showing that by a 58-42 margin, voters believe Trump is doing a better job than Biden. Now overall, Trump's job approval is at 52, but his two major domestic policies, the border and cutting waste are extremely popular, ditto for Trump's emphasis on merit over DEI and hiring.
But what's the Democrats agenda? Well, resisting and repeating their same old, tired lines.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's modeling everything upon this autocratic, authoritarian, dictatorial king like presence that he wants to play inside of our government.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There has been one through line with Donald Trump, it has been his willingness to do Vladimir Putin's bidding.
SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): He is going after critical jobs to save pennies in order to give himself more room to give big tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So that's what they got. That's it. That's what they got. I haven't heard any of that stuff before. Now, while a majority of voters don't agree with Trump on every policy, what's key is that they do feel much more optimistic about America and the economy. It was in the low 30s, remember, for years. And while Congress remains under water, the Democrats are in real trouble.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think you're seeing a retrospective assessment of Biden and the direction that the Democratic Party was going, really a lot more negative than it was on Election Day. And they were looking at the contrast on immigration, on economic policy, on some of the social policies, and boy, they're reevaluating. And the Democratic Party, I have never seen anything like this. This is a record low for the Democratic Party in terms of favorability. It has fallen really, really way down. And I don't think there's any leadership right now that's going to be able to bring that back.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now, how do you resurrect your party, though, by protecting red tape in the bureaucracy, by trying to gin up sympathy for federal workers who need to get real jobs in the real world, like most of America. Ever heard of it. Now, do Democrats really think that Americans will stop liking Trump because he fires these people?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I felt absolutely infuriated getting this email with a demand within 48 hours to provide a response and what I did within the last week, or face termination. This is clearly an attempt from Elon Musk to harass and bully and intimidate the federal workforce, which is part of his broader plan to gut the federal workforce and privatize public sector services.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now, making a list of what you accomplished in a week, that's what she was whining about, is harassment and bullying. Of course, because that requires what 15 minutes of work. Now, these are the same types who think requiring them to return to the office, where they haven't been, oftentimes for four years, that basically amounts to a hate crime.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I thought it was great, because we have people that don't show up to work, and nobody even knows if they work for the government. So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week. What he's doing is saying, are you actually working? What they're doing is they're trying to find out who's working for the government. Are we paying other people that aren't working? And you know, where is all that -- where's the money going?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now, not only is that not unfair to insist on accountability and fiscal sanity in government, but it's also deeply patriotic, because Trump and his team are showing their love for America, just like moms and dads try to stick to a budget. They try. They try to save money, try to make money for their family. Trump wants the same for America at every level.
But what the D.C. uniparty has done for decades has been deeply unpatriotic, printing borrowing and spending money like there's no tomorrow, never changing course. The result ultimately being, you know, if they kept going the way they were going, a total collapse of the American system. That's what Elon Musk has been talking about. But Trump and his team, they celebrate America by embracing sweeping reforms.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The dark days of high taxes, crushing regulations, rampant inflation, flagrant corruption, government weaponization and total incompetence. Those days are over. They're over. But we cannot stop now. We're going to push forward every single day, in the immortal words of that great American hero, Captain John Paul Jones, I have not yet begun to fight.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now the place went totally crazy at CPAC, and I thought to myself, no wonder so many young people and I know mostly young men, but young women too. His numbers are up among young women. They're excited about Trump. Think about this, this generation, the younger generation has heard for years that America is systemically racist. They were told repeatedly to check their privilege at the door and to feel even guilty about their success, guilty about their background.
How boring and depressing that message is, but Trump, he's always the candidate that always knew that America deserved and even wanted more.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I will convene a White House task force called Salute to America 250. It will be responsible for coordinating with state and local governments to ensure not just one day of celebration, but an entire year of festivities across the nation to create the great American state fair, a unique one year exhibition featuring pavilions from all 50 states.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It's going to be fabulous. The 250th anniversary now that Trump is president, imagine under Kamala Harris. That would have been a depressing event. Now look, there are plenty of challenges ahead, including inflation, which Trump has to tackle and tackle very smartly. And he's given us though a profound opportunity to reset and revive our national spirit, and he's well on his way.
And by the way, don't listen to the Left. This is not mindless patriotism. It's how a nation survives and thrives, and that's the Angle.
Now last week, I thought some of the Democrats would have to be committed. They were going so koo-koo. They were so upset over Kash Patel's confirmation to head the FBI.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is one of many of the bizarre political statements made by the man who is asking for 10 years as Director of the FBI.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Kash Patel in the future, breaks the law, violates norms, erodes trust and harms our public safety. Every Republican who votes for him today needs to know that they will own those facts.
SEN. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I cannot imagine the damage that he can do if he's given a decade to do it. And so we find ourselves in really uncharted waters.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Coming from him, who like changed transcripts. But then, of course, what happened? Well, Patel announced his deputy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAN BONGINO, HOST OF THE DAN BONGINO SHOW: I am going in this clear eye. Vision of President Trump, Attorney General Bondi and Director Patel, I am going to do my job to implement that vision, and I can tell you right now, we are going to try our best. We'll have your back. We are going to reestablish faith in this institution. The FBI belongs to the American people. Doesn't belong to me, doesn't belong to anyone else, but the American people. But this is the honor of a lifetime, and it's a serious mission, and I plan on implementing that vision.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now, Congressman Jim Jordan, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee. All right, Congressman, that was just, you know -- this -- we have now, I think a smattering of the Left's early reaction to Dan's appointment. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm trying to think of another agency where you have two such Trump loyalists at the very top. We've already seen the breakdown of the firewall between the Trump White House and the Justice Department, the FBI will play a critical role in the implementation of whatever it is that Donald Trump wants to have done in terms of law enforcement.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, she basically captures it, Congressman.
REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Yes.
INGRAHAM: I mean they don't know what to do. Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, one two punch for fairness in the rule of law that freaks them out.
JORDAN: Yes, and two great guys who share our values and are there to do what the people elected them to do, make sure the FBI is not being weaponized against we, the people, and actually serving us and going after the bad guys like they're supposed to do. Dan Bongino is a good man with experience in the New York Police Department, Secret Service, he's exactly the kind of guy we need.
And the Left misses the fundamental point. Article II, Section 1, first sentence, executive power shall be vested in a president. The president gets to decide who he wants running these important agencies. He wanted Kash Patel. Kash Patel went in front of the Senate. He was confirmed by the United States Senate, and now he wants Dan Bongino. That's how it works, and they're going to do a great job for we, the people.
INGRAHAM: Well, Congressman, I know you're already taking action on the congressional level to subpoena the FBI for weaponization documents hidden by Biden. Now, how soon do you expect to get those documents given the fact that we have, you know, new management over there at the FBI?
JORDAN: Soon, soon, very soon. I mean, we think in the next couple weeks we're going to get -- now these are key, key things that we want, key investigation where we still have the information that we think we are entitled to and answers to questions that we think the American people need. We want to know about the school board's issue, why the Biden administration and Garland did that when they wrote the memo about if you're a pro-life Catholic, you're an extremist.
How about this one, 26 confidential human sources here on January 6th, 17 in restricted space, four in the Capitol, which they were not authorized to be in. Two of the four who went in the Capitol were actually asked to be here by the FBI. They said, can you be here that day? I want to know how much they were paid, how long they have been working for the FBI. How they get in the Capitol? Did they go through a broken window, go through a door? All kinds of questions we have. We want answers to those and a host of other things.
And so the FBI just can't give us this information. Some of it, they just aren't able to do unless we ask for it. So we did with subpoenas today.
INGRAHAM: Well, especially the J6er issue that has to be dealt with. But I know what the Left is going to say, so I'm going to play devil's advocate. They're going to say, oh, for all their big talk about moving forward and moving forward as a nation, they want to go back and continue politicizing these issues, and to that, you would say?
JORDAN: No, the American people who pay for this government are entitled to answers about those 26 confidential human sources, about the guy who put -- he's on video tape, he put the pipe bombs here on January 6th. We'd like to know who that guy is. The FBI can't tell us who planted the pipe bombs, the FBI under Joe Biden and the Justice Department under Merrick Garland couldn't tell us who planted the pipe bombs, who leaked the Dobbs opinion, who put cocaine at the White House. So we're just wanting answers that we think the folks we get the privilege of representing and serving would like to have answers to.
INGRAHAM: Congressman, can't wait for you to get those documents. Thank you so much. And up ahead, we think we have found the Democrat's new leader, the leader of the resistance. We'll introduce him, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Don't you feel a little sorry for the Democrats, I know you do, because they're desperately trying to find a new leader after Kamala, after Joe. They need someone to help them get traction with the regular Americans out there. Someone to help them find their groove. Well, does this guy fit the bill?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Elon Musk, perhaps the President's most visible advisor, doing two Heil Hitler salutes at the President's televised rally.
I'm very reluctant to engage in too much hyperbole here, but I think this is increasingly becoming the most serious moment since the Civil War. I see what they are doing and what they are doing is evil.
This is the most serious constitution crisis the country has faced, certainly since Watergate, the President is attempting to seize control of power and for corrupt purposes. This is a red alert moment when this entire country has to understand that our democracy is at risk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: This from the man who supported the mission that Donald Trump should be removed from the ballot in a dozen states. He's worried about democracy. And of course, the man worried about democracy favored dumping his own party's nominee for a woman who never won a primary.
Joining me now, Michael LaRosa, former Special Assistant to President Biden and Democratic Strategist. Michael, why does Chris Murphy from Connecticut, why does he -- does he seem to be the choice, at least now, to be the main spokesman for the Democrat Party?
MICHAEL LAROSA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I don't think he is, but I do think he is one of the more powerful, more articulate, more talented Democrats that we have that are likely to consider running for president. I think Democrats are going to be disappointed to hear this, though, but there's not going to be disappointed to hear this, though, but there's not going to be a silver bullet, or any one leader who helps bring us back to power, to help us get that subpoena power we want so badly in what a year and a half now. It's not going to be a national message of hyperbole that just won't work. What works in Connecticut will not work in Allentown or Scranton or Colorado, three districts that we lost.
INGRAHAM: That's my point. I grew up in Connecticut. Know the state very well, and a Connecticut liberal, kind of trying to direct the party in the future. I mean, he obviously fancies himself the future Democrat nominee for the presidency, so whether it's him or Gavin. I mean, I think Gavin Newsom could perhaps, and I can't believe I'm even saying this might have more sense and more common man appeal, if I can even say that, then Chris Murphy. I mean, I don't see this. I mean, I'm the happiest person ever if Chris Murphy is your new guy, like if he's the poster child for liberalism, I'm very happy.
LAROSA: Well, I don't know if it's for liberalism, but look, he's right out of central casting. He's young, he's energetic, he's articulate, and every election is a reaction to the next one, right? And I think --
INGRAHAM: But he's saying the same thing, Michael, I'm sorry to interrupt, but he's doing the Heil Hitler salute --
LAROSA: I know.
INGRAHAM: -- attack on democracy. He's a dictator. I mean, this old, frayed page pulled out of the old Democrat playbook in 2024 didn't work.
LAROSA: No, and you're right. It's all about how you -- you talked about Trump in your opening and how he's making people feel that he's doing stuff. Well, I mean, we know, because we worked in government that you're not really doing anything through executive action. All the hard stuff comes at the legislative level, right? But it's how you make you feel. It's a cult of personality. It's like Obama, Trump is the same way. If Murphy can figure out how to be that person, then it doesn't matter what he's saying, it's what Roger Ailes used to say, you are the message, and if he is the message, you know --
INGRAHAM: Well, I'm very happy right now. That's all I have to say. All right. But Bernie Sanders, who does, you know, believe in that kind of Democrat populism. He kicked off a tour for, you know, the future, the anti-oligarchy tour. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): It is not just oligarchy as dangerous as that is, it's not just oligarchy that we are fighting. We are also fighting what is equally dangerous, and that is Trump's moving this country to authoritarianism.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So again, you know not that he screams a vibrant, youthful future either. But again, if you're a young person, why is that a train do you want to hop on?
LAROSA: Losing message. First of all, it's a losing message. It's class warfare. We're better than that. That's not how you win elections. It's also basically saying, you know, we want to preserve the very unpopular bureaucracy. We want to defend an unpopular democracy. Well, that's not how you win elections by defending the status quo, you have to be -- what was number two? Everybody remembers what was number two on James Carville's list, right? It's the economy stupid. I frankly, don't believe that. But the --
INGRAHAM: Well, they tanked the economy. Your party tanked the economy, you tanked the economy, you open the border.
LAROSA: Well, what was number one?
INGRAHAM: And nothing he is saying, nothing he's saying --
LAROSA: What was number one?
INGRAHAM: The economy.
LAROSA: No, it was change. It was change. We have to be on the side of change, like Bill Clinton was, in getting rid of 12 percent of the federal workforce.
INGRAHAM: Yes. Well, now they're for the bureaucracy, red tape and more migrants. So that's what the party is for. Mike, we love having you on. We love having you. Thank you so much. Sorry to interrupt.
All right, in the first Trump term, Europe was in a permanent snit over Trump's America First agenda. They just scoffed at him behind his back. They were certain that he was a one-off, that globalism, not economic nationalism would prevail, but not anymore. A bracing slap of reality hit Germany's political elites yesterday when the Germany first party called AFD, alternative to, for Germany, came in second only to the Christian Democrats. And by the way, it's AFD's strongest showing in decades.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALICE WEIDEL, ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY CO-CHAIR (VIA TRANSLATOR): We are the People's Party. We are stable. The second strongest party in Germany. We are on the rise.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And the new chancellor-elect, a nominal conservative knows AFD could win it all in the next election, and so he's forming a coalition with the hard Left parties in Germany to box out the AFD. Remember, they don't have representative of democracy. They're not lucky like we are, but it's typical of the elites to do that, and it's a huge mistake.
Joining us now, Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Victor, I told my staff on our call today that your speech on Friday night that I had the privilege to sit and listen to off the cuff was one of the best speeches I've heard. I mean, I don't even know and how long. It was fabulous. It was great to see you in person, Victor, with our old friend Scott Atlas and other folks. But you did a great job, and I knew you would have great things to say about this. Why should this matter to us what happened in Germany?
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, because they have been lecturing everybody about democracy, but half the electorate voted for two conservative parties, and the incumbents only got 16 percent of the vote, so there was a rejection of them. But the way their system is going to be rigged, half the people of Germany are going to be disenfranchised because the Christian Democrats are going to work with the Green Party and the failed incumbents to shut out one out of every five German voters.
And then they start giving us lectures. And then, when you step back and you look at Germany and you think, wow, they're paying four times the price of electricity that we are. They're running up a $90 billion trade surplus with us. We have 50,000 soldiers in 40 bases in Germany. Their fertility rate was 1.4. They have no energy, and they're committing collective suicide, and they're no model for anybody, and yet they can't even do the democracy thing that they lecture us about.
So they better be very careful, Laura, because I don't think they're going to get a lot of goodwill from the United States if they keep up this hypocrisy. They're very dependent on us, trade, military, et cetera.
INGRAHAM: Yes, and Victor, to see Macron, of course, today in Washington, he was the elite of the elites, and obviously being very polite to President Trump, but that era is over in Europe, I mean they're trying to cling to power, but Donald Trump is calling the shots, and Germany is going to have to wake up and they're saying they want to be more independent. So I say, yay. I'm glad they're more independent, because it means we won't be footing the bill as much.
HANSON: I do too. The more they lecture everybody that they're afraid of Donald Trump, the more they want to be with him, because being with Donald Trump to their majority population is a good thing. And they know that this tsunami is coming, and it's very Trumpian, and they want to, you know, to the elites trash Trump, but they always want a photo op. When he went to Notre Dame Cathedral, he was like a rock star. And they're so hypocritical, but they know what's coming. They have no legitimacy, and the wave is coming like it did here in Europe.
INGRAHAM: And Victor, the number one issue, the economy, obviously with them, but it's this refugee, the Islamic refugee, speaking of tsunami that hit Europe over the course of many years and is wreaking havoc across Europe in so many countries.
HANSON: The worst is Germany too. I mean, the 16 percent, Laura, of the country was not born in Germany, and they have an open border, and they don't integrate and assimilate anywhere near what we try to do. And so it's a crisis and almost every week there is an immigrant violent act against a German citizen. And I think they've reached the breaking point, but they're looking to us. We have solutions for them, if they'll just -- we're not arrogant. J.D. Vance laid it out, just -- we're not -- we went through this. It's not that we're perfect, but we offer a pathway away from where you are, and we have four years of darkness too. Only you've had about five decades of it. That's the difference.
INGRAHAM: Victor, great to see you as always. So much fun on Friday, phenomenal speech. I wish everyone could have seen it. All right. Ahead a liberal pastor, Left-wing pastor, radical pastor unleashes a racially charged attack against black Trump supporters. You don't want to miss it.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: No, no, no. Not God bless America. God damn America.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK, I know you got sick of that clip, right? With all the Obama years. But I think we may have found the next Jeremiah Wright. Meet Dr. Jamal Bryant. He's a pastor at the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Georgia. Now, we have to warn you, this is disgusting and racist language.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: I feel bad for them (BLEEP) in the White House, who are in there tap dancing for Massa, wearing bow ties, shinning and grinding, laughing like nothing is funny.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, he's talking about Trump's Black History Month reception, which brought together Tiger Woods, Sage Steele and many others. And one of the guests apparently held up a photo of Bryant's head. He didn't like that, so more racist attacks came.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: I ain't afraid of the spooks that sat at the door. These runaway slaves hiding in the White House, going to throw my picture up thinking that I'm going to be afraid.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Terrance K. Williams, comedian. Terrence, this is in a way funny, in a way it's really sad, but you were at the reception, the pastor is talking about. Your thought on what he's labeling. We bleeped it out, bleeped it out, but it started with a C and ended with an S. So, your view on that.
TERRANCE K. WILLIAMS, COMEDIAN: Well, first of all, thank you for having me on. It is a blessing to be on this show. Now, this pastor, Jamal Bryant, is a pool pit pimp, a dollar store pastor. This guy is disgusting. He should be celebrating the fact that black people were in the White House. Now they accused President Donald J. Trump of so-called counseling Black History Month, but he had a black history event to celebrate black Americans.
So, the same people who screamed DEI and Black Lives Matter and they say black people need opportunities and black people need representation, but he's mad because black people were at the White House. I thought they would be happy for black Americans to be in the White House during Black History Month.
And I'm going to tell you right now, I've only experienced racism from the Democratic side. That's my first time ever experiencing that. And he's not the only one. How could you be a pastor on stage calling black people, racial slurs, for going to the White House. And Kamala Harris, well, she just won the NAACP award.
They should have gave that award to President Donald J. Trump because he's done more for black Americans than Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, and all the Democrats put together. He has been a champion for black people, and that's why we were there at the White House to celebrate, to celebrate black Americans, to celebrate American, period.
INGRAHAM: We have another sound bite from Dr. Bryant. Maybe he and Dr. Jill can get together. And where he called out the people at the Black History Month reception, watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Hey, your tough men said whenever I tried to make our people be free, there were a few (BLEEP) that tried to go backwards and tried to risk our freedom. Get out of there (BLEEP) and stand with your people, so that you understand that God is on our side.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Terrance, basically he's saying you're all, all the conservative African-Americans are Uncle Toms. That's basically what he's saying.
WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. I've been getting -- yes, we all have been receiving a lot of backlash for going. They've been calling us Uncle Toms, Whitewash, all of these names, sellouts. This man has to be paid. We need to follow the money. Somebody is paying him. How can you call yourself a pastor and calling people and judging people for once? I thought only God can judge. He should know that. He's a pastor.
This guy has to be, I believe he is a paid shield. He has to be. But we are just Americans. We are Americans who love our country. We are black Americans who can think for ourselves. People fought and died for our right to vote for whoever we want to vote for. People did not fight and die so we can vote for who they tell us to vote for.
And I believe they are just mad because, you know, we have -- we are -- because we have woken up and we realize that -- we realize that the Democratic Party is no good. They have not done anything for the black community and we all realize that, and they are so mad because they cannot control us. They are so mad that they cannot buy our votes anymore.
INGRAHAM: All right.
WILLIAMS: We are not -- our votes are not for sale.
INGRAHAM: Terrance, we love having you on. It's great to see you. I'm glad you're at the White House. Looks like a lot of fun.
WILLIAMS: Thank you.
INGRAHAM: I haven't heard racial epithets like that one, and (INAUDIBLE) - - it's really bad. All right, it's awards season and Kamala finally takes home a prize. We just referenced it. While a liberal Oscar winner takes the mic. Seen and Unseen with Raymond Arroyo is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's time for Seen and Unseen, where we reveal the story behind the headlines, for that we turn to Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo. All right, Raymond, you told us last week that Kamala Harris got an agent, she's going to Hollywood, she's already collecting awards.
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, well, not exactly taking home a Golden Globe, Laura, but give her time. Instead, Kamala Harris accepted the Chairman's Award at the NAACP Image Awards. Now, did she win it for her image? I'm not sure. Whatever the case, she offered her first public speech since losing the White House. Kamala's word of the day is do and done.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAMALA HARRIS. FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy, and ask, what do we do now? But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before, and we will do it again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now does it -- what?
ARROYO: Does that mean they're going to vote against her again? I mean, they've already done it before. Do it again. OK. I'm sure Donald Trump is smiling ear to ear listening to that. But you see the repetition, Laura. It's a circle. None of it makes sense.
INGRAHAM: And before she took home that, what, participation trophy, Raymond, is that what we're calling it? She could not resist hitting Trump and hitting Musk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HARRIS: While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the Oval Office, nor by the wealthiest among us, the American story will be written by you. Written by us, by we the people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, that's sorry rhetoric.
ARROYO: Why is that a news flash, Laura? They always write, I mean, this is the American people writing the story. They elected Donald Trump. So, the guy in the Oval Office and the people, yeah, they're changing the story together. But I'm glad she won an Image Award, Laura, because it's devoid of substance or any self-reflection to course correct. She's just repeating what she did before.
Meanwhile, at another award show, the Screen Actors Guild, they handed out honors for acting, not only image, though for a moment I wish it had been the Audio Guild Awards, there were some audible glitches.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Totally not. As my agents there at that table will testify to. Totally un-strategic. We feel their joys and their pains.
UNKNOWN: Here at the 31st --
UNKNOWN: And I can conjure up voices.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: They should have talked over her the whole time. Just keep talking. We did get to hear most of her, though, Raymond, because to all the veterans out there, Jane Fonda will live in infamy, OK, for what you did to her Vietnam. She gets the lifetime achievement of speech, which -- well, it could have been written by Kamala's people.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Make no mistake, empathy is not weak or woke. And by the way, woke just means you give (BLEEP) about other people. A whole lot of people are going to be really hurt by what is happening, what is coming our way. This is it. And it's not a rehearsal. And we mustn't for a moment kid ourselves about what's happening. This is big time serious, folks. So, let's be brave. We must not isolate. We must stay in community. We must help the vulnerable.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh my god, every viewer is leaving watching that.
ARROYO: Well, they don't call it the SAG Awards for nothing, Laura. But what is she talking about? Stay in community? Why doesn't she help the poor people trying to rebuild their homes after those L.A. fires?
INGRAHAM: Go into the community.
ARROYO: Focus on the waste. Yeah, focus on the waste in California because that's hurting many vulnerable people last time I check.
INGRAHAM: Raymond, if they're going to give her the Lifetime Achievement Award, they should have rolled out a cannon and had her, you know, lie on top of the cannon, lay on top of the cannon, get up there. Yeah, get out in the tank or whatever the hell it was. She's an absolute embarrassment. I mean, I'm sorry.
But why is Jodie Foster, who knows better, why she nodding along. Like, do nod along. It's the same old rebel from the elites in Hollywood. They look down on the people who go to their films to the extent that people are going to the movies anymore. Just looked down at them. They don't have any regard for the American people, except when they cash their checks, and that includes Jane Fonda.
ARROYO: An award ceremony is a moment to honor excellence in whatever the craft is. It's not your political platform.
INGRAHAM: We don't care about your politics.
ARROYO: Go to a protest. Don't do it at an award show.
INGRAHAM: Yeah, we'll just say, or just separate it at least from the award show. If you want to do politics, but we don't need to hear. from her again. I think she looks great for her age. Looks amazing.
ARROYO: Protest after party. Yeah, well, they can't call it the SAG awards, they should call it the cinch awards because everybody is --
INGRAHAM: Raymond, Raymond, Raymond. All right, a saggy message. All right, Raymond, thank you. And ahead, Democrats have a new woke word for a woman. Plus, a big announcement from the Angle.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Connecticut's cannibal killer, a man who ate his victim's brain and eye, is getting released. Fox's Bill Melugin is standing by in our West Coast newsroom with all the details. Bill, what can you tell us?
BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Laura, this story is so crazy that you got to feel like there's some sort of catch to it, right? But there isn't. And the details are just going to leave your jaw on the floor.
So, an institutionalized man named Tyrese Smith confessed to murdering a homeless man in Connecticut back in 2011. He then ate part of his brain and his eye. Well, Mr. Smith has now been granted a conditional release by the Connecticut Psychiatric Security Review Board, which will then allow him to leave his psych hospital.
His doctors are saying the cannibal killer has been rehabilitated and is taking medications to help with the voices in his head. They also say he's a joy and a calming presence to other patients.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: He has maintained clinical stability, adhered to prescribed medications, and continued to engage meaningfully in groups and substance use treatment. He also denied visual hallucinations or a desire to harm others or himself.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELUGIN: And as you can imagine, a lot of people have a lot of problems with that, including a group of Republican state senators who call the release outrageous and mind boggling.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STATE SENATOR PAUL CICARELLA (R-CT): I am not one for the philosophy of lock them up and throw away the key. But we are talking about a very serious crime, murder and cannibalism and release in the same sentence. That's a problem. That's concerning to me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MELUGIN: And family members of the victim, Angel Gonzalez, also object to Smith's release. His sister-in-law told the board they are constantly living in fear.
And, Laura, listen to this, Smith's doctors admitted on Friday that if he forgets to take his medication, those voices in his head telling him to kill people could soon come back. We'll send it back to you.
INGRAHAM: Oh, my goodness. Bill, well, thank you, I guess. Thank you for that report. Unbelievable. All right, and the far-left Democrat Wisconsin Governor, Tony Evers, is -- he's the gift that keeps on giving. Apparently, he wants to help Republicans increase their vote in 2026, because he's launched a verbal war on motherhood. He wants the word mother banished, changing it in his budget proposal to, wait for it, parent who gave birth to the child or inseminated person instead.
And men fare no better here. Evers wants to ditch man and husband, those words, and replace them with spouse of the inseminated person. Joining me now, Ned Ryun, American Majority founder and CEO. Ned, you know, you got that Supreme Court race coming up in Wisconsin, which is so important, we're going to get into that later on in the week. But we still have time before Mother's Day, so are you going to get your wife an inseminated person's card instead?
NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Well, I first have to confess that it was not on my bingo card to be talking about inseminated persons on primetime television, but that's due to the insanity of the left. But the real war on women, Laura, if people have been paying attention, is from the left. Their war on women, their war on science. I mean, just think about the term. Inseminated person, how degrading, how dehumanizing it is. I mean, you're essentially reducing a mother to a living, breathing test tube.
But the amazing part is, you're right. The left is continuing to double down on this. It's insane. It's like November 5th didn't happen. It's like Donald Trump didn't win. But again, it does highlight once that woke mind virus infects your brain, you become dumb, you become weak, you become irrational, and you become delusional in adolescence.
I mean, this is insane that they think this is something that they have to pursue and fight for, when, in fact, the American people made it very clear on November 5th. They were done with this crazy left wokeness.
INGRAHAM: Well, it's like the tampons in the boys' room, right? It's the same thing. It's just an extension of that. So, they -- but they've cleverly used language, Ned. You and I have talked about this in an Orwellian fashion to change the debate. So, when you're pro-abortion you're really pro-choice. But if you're pro-life you're really anti-abortion rights activists, right? This is what they've always done.
RYUN: They have. They've attempted to play games with the words to change the debate. But I will say this, I mean, Donald Trump, I thought it was brilliant, one of his first executive orders was to address this issue. There are only two genders. Men are men, women are women. That's what God intended.
And I think what the American people have been so desperate for, and one of the reasons that Donald Trump won, is a return to common sense. And I think that the left is going to be waging war, continuing to wage war against common sense, but I think the American people are done with this.
They want to return to common sense. They want leadership that actually advocates it on all issues, including this issue of two genders.
INGRAHAM: All right, Ned, as always, this is insane. I didn't know we were talking about this, but there's no one better to talk about this than you. I'm just teasing you. Ned, thanks so much. All right. I won't do that to you again, Ned.
All right, that's it for us tonight. I'm going to be back here on Wednesday because in a few hours I'm getting on a plane with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to get an inside look at Gitmo, where the administration, of course, is housing illegals before they're deported back to their home countries.
We'll bring it all to you along with an interview with the secretary in the coming days. You're not going to want to miss it. Thank you for watching. It's America Now and Forever. Jesse is next.
