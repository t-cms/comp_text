Saturday Night Live's Legacy: Why SNL still matters
Bri Raymond, Growl Editor
February 25, 2025
Live from New York, it's... one of the most influential comedy shows. For over five decades now, Saturday Night Live has been a ritualistic routine for many American households and recently just had its 50th anniversary. From its groundbreaking debut in 1975 to its present-day influence, SNL has not only provided a platform for comedic legends like Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Adam Sandler but also reflected and responded to the ever-changing political and social climate. 
Creating Comedy Legends
One of SNL's greatest legacies is being able to launch the comedy careers of icons who go on to define the entertainment industry. In the late 70s when the show first started stars like Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, and Gilda Radnor paved the way for future cast members and set the foundations for modern sketch comedy. While the show struggled in the 80s and 90s, the rise of Eddie Murphy kept the show afloat due to his charisma and talent along with Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, and Mike Myers. In the early 2000s, comedic powerhouses like Will Ferrell, Kristin Wiig, and Amy Pohler dominated SNL. Not only did they command sketch comedy but many cast members went on to revolutionize comedy television and movies. Many of the current cast members are also paving their own way in the comedy world like Bowen Yang being cast in one of the biggest movies of the year, Wicked. SNL is not just a late-night show, but a way for aspiring comedians to enter and grow in the comedy world.
Political Satire
Not only is SNL just about comedic sketches and having a celebrity host, it's also about commenting on the world we live in, in a satirical way. Many cast members take on impersonations of different political roles, from Chey Chase's bumbling General Ford to Tina Fey's uncanny Sarah Palin. SNL plays an influential role in how people view politics and national issues. In a society where politics dominates daily conversations, satire serves as both entertainment and a tool for holding power accountable. SNL makes these issues more accessible to the general public who don't always check the news every day. However, a lot of critics argue that SNL has become too politically based, I think that it is a true reflection of the absurdities in politics we often face. Regardless of where people stand, the debate itself is proof of the show's cultural impact. Whether through Alec Baldwin's divisive portrayal of Donald Trump or Kate McKinnon's emotional take on Hillary Clinton, SNL doesn't just reflect the political landscape, it actively influences it. 
The Magic of Live TV
With most movies and television shows only being shown on streaming services like Netflix or Max, SNL being filmed live in front of studio audiences adds a sense of humanness and magic. One of the best aspects of these live shows is being able to see the cast break and laugh when they are not supposed to and end up creating icon moments that fans love. From "Debbie Downer" to "Beavis and Butthead," these infamous sketches hold special places in a lot of fan's hearts. While the format has led to its fair share of controversies-such as unexpected F-bombs and unpredictable guest performances, it's also what makes SNL electric. The understanding that anything could go wrong at any moment keeps audiences engaged in a way that polished, pre-recorded comedy never could. It's this unfiltered, real-time energy that has kept SNL a must-watch event for nearly 50 years.
