Letter from the editor: A reflection on WSN's mission
It's my last semester leading the publication, and all I can think about is how proud and hopeful I am for the future of student journalism.
Yezen Saadah, Editor-in-Chief
January 22, 2025
Alisia Houghtaling (Alisia Houghtaling for WSN)
Dear readers,
This spring marks my last semester as WSN's editor-in-chief and possibly my final semester working at the paper. Though I am only a junior, I can't help but feel a bit nostalgic. My college career thus far has been defined by spending upwards of 40 hours a week in a basement with nothing but the following in mind: report, write, edit, publish and, somehow, make enough time for homework - and I certainly haven't been alone in this endeavor. 
Over the past three years, I've met some extraordinary human beings who made it their mission to serve and inform the NYU and Greenwich Village communities, whatever the cost. I've met people, some of whom have grown to be the best journalists I know, who would drop everything in that pursuit - to take that photo, to get that interview and to work well past midnight every weekday no matter what exam they had to study for or essay they needed to finish. Many of our dedicated journalists made great sacrifices to be where they are today, and these sacrifices are in turn rewarded in ways that are endlessly gratifying. 
Just this past year, WSN has been cited by prominent news outlets across the country such as The Guardian and The New York Times, from thoroughly reporting on demonstrations over the war in Gaza to our opinion, culture, arts and sports desks which give students the opportunity to express themselves. Students, faculty, alumni, parents, guardians and countless members of the NYU community have expressed their gratitude for our coverage. To know that our work has, at the very least, benefited one person is enough to satisfy our drive to produce more content and inform more readers. 
As our student journalists stood on the frontlines of protests and held our immensely powerful and well-resourced institution accountable, it was their belief in WSN's mission that pushed them forward. Last semester was no exception as members of our staff walked into the newsroom with a deep sense of purpose, driven by the importance of what we do - not just for our campus, but for a broader global conversation. 
That commitment to truth has never been more important. In an era where misinformation spreads quickly and the line between fact and opinion is increasingly blurred, the role of student journalism - of WSN - is more vital than ever. We are not just covering events; we are shaping narratives, questioning authority and providing a platform for diverse perspectives. Each article, each editorial, each photograph is an opportunity to participate in the ongoing dialogue that is necessary for a thriving democracy and an informed society.
The students who pass through WSN's halls do not just leave with a portfolio of published work - they leave with a sense of responsibility, a sharpened critical eye and an unshakeable belief in the power of storytelling. They understand that journalism is not just about what is reported, but how it is reported, and they take that knowledge with them wherever they go. I have seen firsthand the ways in which this paper has shaped careers, opened doors and sparked lifelong friendships. It is a testament to the dedication of the staff, the resilience of our community and the mission we hold dear.
The next generation of student journalists is already stepping up - bringing fresh ideas, new perspectives and an unwavering dedication to the mission of providing quality, impactful journalism to our campus. Last semester, with the help of our immensely talented Opinion Editors, we revitalized our opinion section and produced coverage related to the 2024 presidential election. We've published house editorials holding NYU's administration accountable in ways our news coverage cannot. And it doesn't stop there - our incredible Under the Arch team produced two special print issues, and our sports desk continued to shed light on the ins and outs of the lives of student-athletes at NYU. 
I - along with the rest of our staff at WSN - could not be more thankful for the support of our readership. Your engagement with our work, your trust in our reporting and your continued encouragement fuel our efforts to produce journalism that matters. As we move forward, I ask you to keep holding us accountable, to keep reading, to keep questioning and to keep being a part of the conversation. We are only as strong as the community we serve, and together, we will continue to make the impact that true journalism is meant to have.
With gratitude,
Yezen Saadah
