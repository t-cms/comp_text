MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: -- the collusion hoax at the FBI, so you could not have a better person there to clean out the problems there.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": It's very exciting. Mollie and Alex, thanks so much.
That's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media. A lot of Zoe reaction last night.
Thanks for watching. It's America now and forever.
Jesse Watters, he takes it from here.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me ask you, is there anybody like our Tiger?
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(DONALD TRUMP AND CROWD chanting "Tiger.")
MACDONALD: Trump celebrates Black History Month his way.
LEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: We are in the presence of the greatest president of all time.
STEPHEN MILLER, DEPUTY CHIEF-OF-STAFF OR POLICY AND HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: He has packed eight years of transformative action in just one month. No one in this country has ever seen anything like it.
WATTERS: One month down, four years to go -- or eight.
TRUMP: Should I run again? You tell me.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: There's your controversy right there.
SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): I would analogize this to a smash-and-grab robbery and doing as much destruction as you can quickly as to your advantage.
WATTERS: DOGE steals the left's dignity.
ELON MUSK, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: You know who complained the loudest, the fraudsters.
WATTERS: Plus --
(PEOPLE chanting "This is what democracy looks.")
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: You want to be on T.V.?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please do not speak to this person.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Watch out, Elon has got a chainsaw.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. Chainsaw.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And get ready, D.C., you're next in line behind Canada.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I think that we should govern District of Columbia. It's so important, the D.C. situation. I think that we should run it strong, run it with law and order, make it absolutely flawlessly beautiful and I think we should take over Washington, D.C. and make it safe.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: D.C. got their first mayor in 1975. Before that, Congress controlled the Capitol. Now Trump wants it, which would make him the first mayor president ever, unless Stephen Miller wants to be the Duke of Washington.
Musk satisfied with merely being tech support, and if Musk fails, so does America.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: You know, I grew up in South Africa, and my morality was informed by America. I read comic books, played Dungeons and Dragons and I watched American TV shows, and it is like -- it seemed like, America cared about being the good guys, you know, about doing the right thing, and that's actually pretty unusual, by the way.
And so I was like, yes, you know, you want to be this good, but you want to be on the side of good, you want to care about what's right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Elon and the brainiacs -- sounds like a band -- have been given unfettered access to the government's back office. DOGE is in god mode, and there isn't anywhere they won't go.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We do want to look at them. We hope everything's fine with Fort Knox, but we're going to go to Fort Knox, the fabled Fort Knox to make sure the gold is there.
REPORTER: Where would the gold have gone?
TRUMP: If the gold isn't there, we're going to be very upset.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And Big Balls is going to Ukraine.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It's also time to find out what happened with all the money, because he made the statement that half of it he doesn't know where it is, or something like that. And I'd like to find out where the money that we've been sending to Ukraine -- where is it?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: DOGE is sniffing around Ukraine, Fort Knox, the IRS, The Pentagon -- I think it's pretty obvious now why they wanted Trump dead or in jail, and the CIA is on the clock for releasing files on JFK, RFK, and MLK. So get ready for some March Madness.
Stacey Abrams is about to get DOGE'd. Right after she lost her last election, she started a climate group with a bunch of other people. You know, if you're a Democrat, you've got to have a climate charity.
Well, it started out with just a hundred bucks. Couldn't raise a penny. Then Biden comes in, and voila, they donate $2 billion to this brand new group.
What does Stacey Abrams know about the climate? She's an erotic thriller writer who lives outside of Atlanta. Has Stacey Abrams ever even gone hiking? I don't know. She just doesn't strike me as a nature enthusiast.
Did Stacey Abrams plant any trees with the money? Did she pick up any litter? Well, we can't find any evidence that this group did anything for the climate.
Trump's guys are trying to claw back the cash, but that is a lot of money. And this is how the game works: Democrats launch 501 (c3)s. Their friends in DC send them our money, and then they hire their cousins, pay all themselves fat salaries, and use the money to travel first class of course, to climate summits and pay Al Gore to speak at their events.
Everywhere you look in Washington are deals like this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: Waste is pretty much everywhere. People ask, like, how can you find waste in -- like in D.C.? I'm like, Look, it's like being in a room and there is a target -- the wall, the roofs and the floor are all targets. So it's like, you're going to close your eyes and go shoot in any direction, because you can't miss, you know?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Elon is showing up with a chainsaw, and he's holding D.C. hostage to get your money back and Trump loves the idea.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: Elon Musk is proposing potentially giving money to Americans based on what DOGE is finding. Do you have any thoughts on that?
TRUMP: I love it. Twenty percent dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening. I think it's a great idea.
REPORTER: How much money do you think would be?
TRUMP: It would be a lot. I mean, if it's 20 percent, we'd give back a lot of money to the taxpayer, and also a given incentive for the taxpayer to go out and report things to us where we can save money.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats are saying, not so fast, that's not your money. That's our money.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ABC NEWS HOST: President Trump says he likes the idea of giving some of the savings from DOGE back to Americans as kind of a dividend. Would you support that?
REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): No, we are not in the business of giving out money. And honestly, I don't know what $5,000.00 will do for you if you are unable to find a job, because I am telling people, we are headed towards a recession.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The Democrats saying $5,000.00 won't do anything for you, are the same ones who said your house just burned down in Maui, oh, here's 750 bucks.
Crockett used to love checks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CROCKETT: Cracking and bag them stimmy checks. That is my message.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great.
CROCKETT: Because, again, I just explained to you the co-equal branches of government.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.
CROCKETT: It was Nancy Pelosi who was running the House at the time, not Bag of Mike, but Nancy. It was Sister Nancy.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.
CROCKETT: You need to thank Nancy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: We had to print money to send out those checks. With a DOGE stimmy, we don't have to. It's a rebate check. They took it from you, and you're getting it back.
People in North Carolina, the Pacific Palisades, Maui -- they could use a check right about now. Even the bureaucrats who were laid off could use the rebate.
But this little senator, not so Young Sheldon, says giving Americans back their own money is a crime.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WHITEHOUSE: I would analogize this to a smash-and-grab robbery. And speed is to your advantage when you're the smash-and-grab robber, and doing as much destruction as you can quickly is to your advantage when you're the smash-and-grab robber.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now they care about smash and grabs.
Shelly did the smash-and-grab himself. He taxed you, said he was going to build roads and bridges here, and then just gave Juan a sex change in Guatemala.
We didn't vote for sex changes in Guatemala. Joe Biden never campaigned on that. Congress sent COVID money to a school in California. They said, screw hand sanitizers and new laptops, they spent 400 grand renting out a Major League Baseball Stadium for graduation, for social distancing, maybe, I don't know. There it is Angels Stadium.
These people don't care how hard you work to make that money, they will just waste it like that. No respect.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: People ask me, what's the most surprising thing that you've encountered when you go to D.C.? You know, we're in D.C., and I said, well, the most surprising thing is the scale of the expenditures and actually how easy it is to -- with a -- just when you add caring and competence where it was absent before, you can actually save billions of dollars.
Sometimes, in an hour, they really lack empathy for the average taxpayer who's working hard, paying taxes, and then, and then they say, oh, a million dollars, it doesn't matter. I'm like, I think it rattles a lot.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The only thing PRIMETIME has discovered where we said, okay, well, you know what? This probably had an impact these DOGE cuts so far -- so far, there were longer lines to get into a few National Parks, and the locksmith got laid off at Yosemite, and someone got locked in the bathroom, so it took him a while to get out.
How do you get locked in the bathroom? Never mind.
Americans are getting laid off all the time in the private sector, mass layoffs. "The Washington Post" just laid off four percent of its workforce. Are fired writers being interviewed on "60 Minutes"? No.
Southwest Airlines just laid off 15 percent of its workforce, and that's like the one airline that hasn't crashed. What's the difference?
Well, the left thinks government workers are more important than workers in the private sector. They believe government workers do more for the country and the country couldn't survive without them.
So this is a test, all right, if DOGE kills America, I was wrong, and I'll admit it, but if next year, America is still here, the left owes me an apology. We'll just add it to the list.
Their new hoax is that now Musk is a Putin puppet.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: Before, like, sometimes they are like to -- they like to say like, I'm a bought asset of Putin. I'm like, he can't afford me.
(LAUGHTER)
ROB SCHMITT, NEWSMAX: I think you're worth more than Russia.
MUSK: Think about it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: You can't buy the richest man in the world, and that's what drives Democrats nuts. Can't buy him, can't shame him, can't cancel him. You can't de-bank him. And the world's richest man is teamed up with the world's most powerful man.
Now Trump has the Secret Service, he should be in good shape. We hope, we pray, but Democrats are making things dangerous for Elon.
The other day, a Tesla dealership was vandalized. Pam Bondi just launched Operation Whirlwind, and anyone slinging threats at Elon will be held accountable. Chuck Schumer has already gotten letters from the Justice Department.
There's nothing tyrannical going on here, and if there is, that's what we pay lawyers for.
America's heartthrob, Stephen Miller gave the press a Civics lesson. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHEN MILLER, DEPUTY CHIEF-OF-STAFF OR POLICY AND HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: It is true that many of the people in this room for four years failed to cover the fact that Joe Biden was mentally incompetent and was not running the country.
It is also true that many people in this room who have used this talking point that Elon is not elected fail to understand how government works. So I'm glad for the opportunity for a brief Civics lesson.
A president is elected by the whole American people. He's the only official in the entire government that is elected by the entire nation. The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president.
That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will on to the government.
The threat to democracy, indeed, the existential threat to democracy is the unelected bureaucracy of lifetime, tenured civil servants who believe they answer to no one.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump can hire whoever he wants. It's not like Biden who flew his son all over the world in a government jet and shook down foreign nationals for access. Elon has a nose for this. He's a computer science wizard, a turn-around artist, and he's pretty good with numbers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: I'll tell you a lesson I learned at PayPal. You know who complained the loudest -- the quickest and the loudest and with the most amount of righteous indignation -- the fraudsters, that's who complained first loudest, and they would generally have this immense overreaction. That's how we knew they were the fraudsters. That's how we knew. That's a tell.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is here.
All right, so Governor, we've had about a month of DOGE, have the oranges in Florida fallen apart? Have the beaches been spoiled? Is Florida just a disaster zone?
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We're doing great. Actually, it is very exciting to see what they're doing. It's a long time coming, and I think the proof is going to be in the pudding when Congress has to now act, because Elon and his team can do all this. The President can authorize swift action, but Congress ultimately is going to be responsible for changing its behavior and taking away this spending.
And the reason why you see some of the things that you pointed out and others have pointed out in other areas is because Congress has been asleep at the switch for decades.
They passed Continuing Resolutions and let the bureaucrats run wild. They pass Omnibus Bills, which nobody reads, and let the bureaucrats run wild.
So when there's no accountability, you give license for bad behavior. Now you have DOGE shining a light on this. I think it's been incredibly healthy.
You know, in Florida, we were DOGE before DOGE was cool. We have the lowest number of government employees per capita in the entire United States, and we've paid off 36 percent of our state's debt from the 1840s to the present. Just since I've been governor, we've done that.
So we're all about it. If they can deliver this in Congress, that will be good for the country. It will definitely be good for Florida, but we need Congress to step up and change its behavior.
WATTERS: They won't, and I'm confident they won't, even the Republicans who control it, they won't do it. It will never happen. That's why I'm just so excited about DOGE because that's the only thing that's going to happen.
When you worked with Pam Bondi, or you worked with Kristi Noem to get these illegal alien criminals out of Florida, how is that going so far?
DESANTIS: Well, I called a special session of the Florida Legislature before Donald Trump was even sworn in, because we wanted to be ready. And so what we have done is a number of things. One, we've made illegally entering Florida to be a state crime, so we can use our state law enforcement to hold them accountable, then turn them over to ICE.
Two, we've ended this idea of catch-and-release, so we'll deny you bail if you're a criminal alien, so that we can notify ICE, and then we've imposed a duty on all state and local law enforcement to actively participate with federal immigration enforcement.
Yes, we banned sanctuary cities first year as governor. We're not a sanctuary state. But it's not enough to just say you're not allowed to sabotage. We don't want people just sitting on their hands, because in order to deliver on President Trump's mandate of having the largest deportation in American history, you have to have state and local law enforcement in the game and on the team.
ICE does not have enough personnel to be able to do what would need to be done. So we were the first state to come in. We've imposed that duty.
And the good thing, Jesse, with what the legislature just passed and I signed, if you have some type of recalcitrant Mayor that's ordering the police to not assist federal immigration authorities, I can suspend that mayor from office.
You have people, county officials who are doing the same, I am able to suspend them and hold them accountable. So we have real teeth in what the legislature did. We're on the team.
I think what President Trump is doing on immigration is vitally important for our country. I think that's one of the main reasons he got elected. But I think if we don't do it this time, then I think we're just never going to get it done.
WATTERS: Well, you guys were ahead of the curve on voting, on DOGE, on illegal immigration, make America Florida again is always a good slogan that everybody needs to hear.
Thank you so much, Governor DeSantis, good to see you again.
DESANTIS: Thanks, Jesse.
WATTERS: Breaking news on Kash Patel and the FBI.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Fox News Alert: Kash Patel has been confirmed as our new FBI director in a 51 to 49 vote. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, voted no.
Kash is an outsider who promised to reform the agency, get it back to fighting crime and give us the answers we've been waiting for.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: Why do we still know nothing about that guy in Butler? What's going on?
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
MUSK: But Kash is going to get to the bottom of it.
SCHMITT: Yes, there we go.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Kash was a controversial pick for some, but he proved himself at the hearing and is now going to lead the Bureau.
Have you caught your breath yet? It's been one month since Trump was sworn in.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JD VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I do think that we've had maybe more executive orders than CNN has viewers tonight. So hello to our friends at CNN.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump signed more executive orders in the first 30 days than every president since the 80s combined. And we can already see the change.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MILLER: Criminals are going home. The border is sealed shut. America is safe, sovereign, proud and free. We are a nation that everyone in the world understands all across this planet, you do not come here illegally, you will not get in.
You will go to jail, you will go home, you will not succeed.
This is the biggest and most successful change in any area of law enforcement that this nation has ever seen, and he did it in under one month.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The America we knew under Joe Biden has vanished. Poof -- like that, .
"President Trump's first month in office has exceeded the wildest dreams of his most loyal supporters and the darkest nightmares of his fiercest detractors. The America that Joe Biden left behind on Jan. 20th is no longer recognizable, erased in four frenetic weeks by an empowered, implacable and historically popular MAGA presidency."
The White House celebrated the one month anniversary by handing out nine- page packets full of Trump's accomplishments. Gave it to the press. Doubt they'll report on it. So I will. Here's some highlights.
Border secured. Hostages returned, girls' sports saved, DEI dead. fraud DOGE'd, Cabinet cleared, hundreds of billions of foreign investments secured, drill baby, drill and paper straws canceled, just to name a few.
The President also honored Black History Month today with a very special guest.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Is there anybody like our Tiger? How are you? Would you want to just say a couple of words? He doesn't.
He's much more comfortable.
(PEOPLE AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP chanting "Tiger.")
TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: It's an honor to be here. It's honor to be here with you, Mr. President, and to be honored to be here with all of you.
Thank you so much.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Things are going so well, he is thinking about never leaving.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Oh, I'm not -- I won't be happy the next time. Should I run again? You tell me.
(PEOPLE shouting "yes.")
TRUMP: There's your controversy right there.
(PEOPLE chanting "Four more years.")
TRUMP: Gotcha. You'll be seeing that -- you're going to see -- you're going to see that tonight on television.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Four more years of Trump, Democrats might actually move to Canada, but by that time, it will be a state.
It's been a whirlwind month. That's all part of the plan. "Unlike Trump 1.0, the chaos is calculated and explicitly designed to institutionalize MAGA, paralyze the President's enemies and permanently break the Washington establishment."
It's not just D.C. getting a makeover, he is upending the world order. "No one expected Trump to handle global affairs like his predecessors, but few expected him to move so rapidly to reorient U.S. foreign policy away from the course it has charted since 1945."
Trump is making our foreign policy more transactional. No more freebies from the U.S. If you want our help, you've got to bring something to the table, and the President is taking a different approach to Ukraine.
"A modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion to go into a war that couldn't be won. Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is missing. He refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden like a fiddle, a dictator without elections. Zelenskyy better move fast, or he is not going to have a country left. Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the gravy train going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job. His country is shattered, and millions have unnecessarily died."
Is this all part of the negotiation? I have no idea.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: I think what President Trump, what makes him such an effective negotiator, I've seen this in private, is that he doesn't take anything off the table.
When he walks into negotiation, he says, everything is on the table. And of course, that makes the heads explode in the American media, because they say, why are you talking to Russia? Well, how are you going to end the war unless you're talking to Russia? You've got to talk to everybody involved in the fighting if you actually want to bring the conflict to a close.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Senator Josh Hawley is here.
So, Senator, why the President rip Zelenskyy's face off?
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Well, why did he? It is because he wants to bring him to the negotiating table. That's exactly what the Vice President just said, Jesse, and you're right.
I mean, listen, this has been an incredible month. President Trump has gotten Russia to the negotiating table after they refused to come for years. I mean, Joe Biden, they wouldn't sit down with Joe Biden. They wouldn't do anything for him.
Trump has them at the table. Zelenskyy will come to the table. And whether we're talking about Ukraine, whether we're talking about the fraud and waste and abuse that the President is exposing everywhere.
Here's how I look at it, Jesse, he is really -- he is getting the rot out of our government. Never has this government been so corrupt, and Trump is just tearing the rot out of the government and it is a great thing to see.
WATTERS: I have a feeling Zelensky said no to the mineral deal. But maybe that's just, maybe that's just a bad guess.
When you walk around in Washington, what does Chuck Schumer say when he walks past you? What do all of these Democrats say when you guys are walking around? I know you lock eyes.
HAWLEY: You know, I think that the word I would use is demoralized.
Jesse, they don't know what to do. I mean here, they're out here, defending USAID. They're defending billions of dollars spent on transgender operas in Peru. I mean, make my day, go ahead. You can defend that all day long. We'd love to talk about that.
You want to run the next election on that? Go right ahead. The problem is they're the party of the corruption in government. They're the party of pardons for Hunter Biden and all of his cronies, and pardons for criminals and rapists, which is how Joe Biden left office.
They're the party of entrenched power, and as Trump exposes the corruption, he is exposing their agenda and the rot in their agenda. They don't have anywhere to go, and I think that's what you're seeing.
WATTERS: It's fun to watch the Democrats defend the IRS. Nothing better than that. Music to my ear -- and they do sing a lot, so I will send you some ear plugs, Senator. I know it hurts down there.
HAWLEY: I need them.
WATTERS: All right, see you soon.
HAWLEY: Thank you.
WATTERS: Robert De Niro and January 6th, right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: A tectonic shift is happening in America. The culture is moving in the right direction.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VANCE: My message to young men is, I think, that our culture sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge. You should -- you should try to cast aside your family. You should try to suppress what makes you a young man in the first place, and I think that my message to young men is, don't allow this broken culture to send you a message that you're a bad person because you're a man, because you like to tell a joke, because you like to have a beer with your friends, or because you're competitive.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
VANCE: And we want you guys to thrive as young men and as young women, and we're going to help with our public policy to make it possible to do that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: It's like the Roaring Reagan 80s, being patriotic and popping your collar is cool. Well, maybe not popping your collar, but you know what I mean?
"The Journal" says: "There are signs that MAGA isn't just retaking the White House, it's gaining a firmer foothold in the broader culture. NFL players are doing the Trump dance in the endzone at football games; mainstream entertainers agreed to perform an event celebrating Donald Trump's Inauguration; Trump-friendly comedians and wellness influencers are populating YouTube and other social media."
Democrats, on the other hand, not doing so hot, just 21 percent of voters approve of Democrats in Congress. That's an all-time low. I wonder why. Maybe it has to do with the way they speak to voters.
Jasmine Crockett says this is why Trump won. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": All of the criticisms that exist of Donald Trump, he right now, has a 53 percent approval rating. It is higher than it has ever been; 70 percent believe that he is fulfilling his promises, and 45 percent believe Democrats should be more moderate.
What do you take away?
CROCKETT: My takeaway is, just like the election, we've got to do better at education. People don't understand.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Okay, educate me. And boy does she miss the Big Guy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CROCKETT: Maybe Sleepy Joe is what we wanted, because we could at least sleep at night.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: You hear that? Historic inflation, a wide open border, two proxy wars and a coup was just white noise. Jasmine slept like a baby.
Joe's replacement wasn't any better. Her campaign was historic, but not in a good way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
EVAN SMITH, "OVERHEARD WITH EVAN SMITH": It was that time she was on "The View" and she was asked, "What would you have done differently?" And she said, basically, nothing I could think of. A lot of people say that was the moment that the election was lost.
DAVID AXELROD, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I got a -- I got a text from a -- from a prominent Democrat in the Midwest who I respect that said, instantly, "I think she just lost the election."
SMITH: Will history be kind to her in terms of how she ran this campaign, given the structural impediments to winning?
AXELROD: I will be kind to her. I don't know about history.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Kamala tanks the party, and if Democrats want to revive it, they need to start living in reality and stop being snobs.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
AXELROD: The Democratic Party has in some ways become too much seen by too many Americans as the party of elites and institutions that have failed them.
If you were talking about democracy over the dinner table, you probably didn't have to worry about the cost of the food on that table.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Hollywood is not getting the memo. They'd rather double down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHEN COLBERT, "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT" HOST: When you think hero, who do you think of?
ROBERT DE NIRO, ACTOR: I don't know.
COLBERT: Do you have an American hero?
DE NIRO: I do think of -- I think of the Capitol Police, the guys of the Capital Police.
COLBERT: Can you imagine being a Capitol Police now and watching those people march in past you who want to deny that you served them that day?
DE NIRO: Yep. It's something.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: It's a fun show. No one cares what Robert De Niro has to say about politics. Just ask the guy who played JD Vance in "Hillbilly Elegy."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GABRIEL BASSO, ACTOR: I don't believe that actors should be famous. Yes, it feels like something that, you know, we're saying words that we're told to say. We're saying then -- we're told how to say them. We're told where to stand, and then we're telling people how to vote.
It's like, dude, your job is illegitimate. Like you should be quiet. You should do your job. You should be a jester, entertain people, and then shut the (bleep) up.
We're like, we're entertaining. We're public servants. We're there to perform a job, to entertain. And then all of a sudden, the jester, because he's in the courtroom starts to be like, I might want to go sit on the throne. It's like, no, you're not supposed to be there.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Nationally syndicated radio host, Dana Loesch joins us now. How are you, Dana?
DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST AND AUTHOR: I'm doing well, Jesse, and I really like that soundbite. I think that that actually perfectly encapsulates what we're seeing with Democrats and Republicans right now.
And you and I have talked about this for years, and I think I said a decade ago that people on the right, that's the new punk rock. It's very -- it's not -- it's very against the grain, very against mainstream, which is apparently, let Uncle Sam control your life.
And I have to say, too, when you played, Jesse the audio of David Axelrod talking -- he acts like the soothsayer. You know, he's looking back and he's saying that -- he is saying all of these things trying to sound very wise.
David Axelrod was part of this. I mean, he was part of the Obama administration. They guided that administration into setting the stage for what Democrats have become today.
So it's incredibly rich for a lot of these people to make these remarks now, because they're safe, right? It doesn't cost them anything to do it now, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'll give credit where due.
I honestly think that James Carville was the only one who was trying to send a wake-up call to these people, but they didn't pay attention to him, because the party -- Democrats, they allowed the people that they used as their agitators for get out the vote. They enshrined them within the Democratic Party and adopted all of their insanity as part of their platform.
So if they're looking where all of their Democrat voters are culturally or at the ballot box, they left. They registered as Independents, or they went and voted for Trump, because the right has learned how to build a coalition, and that's what people like.
They don't want to have to forfeit everything that they know to be true just to cast a vote for an elected official or somebody like Kamala Harris, who is the person that they got to jump on the landmine of this losing election for them.
So I don't really feel a lot of pity for them. I don't.
WATTERS: Do you think that the Democrat Coalition is going to get it together?
LOESCH: No.
WATTERS: Or do you think we're going to see this and report on this and do segments like this for the next of couple years?
LOESCH: You know what? I hope so. Because I live for that content injected in my veins, Jesse. I live for the ridicule of that failing party. Because they, I will say, Democrats, used to have a coalition, but they wanted cultural and ideological hegemony, and so now all of those people, the right have one.
I really hope the right maintain it. That's what it's going to take to survive, even after POTUS and go into 2026 and 2028, we have to have that coalition.
WATTERS: All right, I agree. Dana Loesch, great to see you as always. Thanks so much.
LOESCH: Good to see you.
WATTERS: Happy. DEI Thursday.
And Johnny goes to a DOGE protest.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We will be doing this on a weekly basis. DEI is something we must have.
WATTERS: Happy DEI Thursday. PRIMETIME's favorite day of the week.
You might be saying, Jesse, I thought DEI was dead. Big Balls is working on it, but we found some things we want to bring to your attention.
Like this in Colorado, don't you dare misgender a corpse. You're going to catch a charge. A new Democrat bill wants to put doctors and morticians in prison if they don't use the right pronouns for dead trans people, and if you still do make this deadly mistake, they/them will correct you from the coffin, and their trans ghosts will haunt you for life.
This next one, RFK, Jr., close your ears. The University of Alabama is currently celebrating Fat February.
So forget cutting weight for spring break, just sit down and eat up. Rule number one, faculty is prohibited from diet talk. It might upset the girls who put on the Freshman 15 and the boys who put on the Freshman 40.
Rule number two, it's okay to be fat, actually. Correction, it's encouraged to be fat. And of course, students can help celebrate Fat February with affirmation mirrors and this important compliment jars, yes.
And lastly, Washington State wants nothing to do with Washington. Their leaders say, Who cares what we're called? Let's take the founder off our flag. State Democrats say it's not about George Washington. It's about the esthetics and a fancier design.
Sure.
Usually this is where we'd say time for a PRIMETIME victory, but that's what our entire show is now. So happy DEI Thursday and enjoy winning.
This week, a few protests broke out against Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE, but who are these people? Have they been personally affected? Do they even know what's getting cut. Johnny went into the belly of the beast.

(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)

BELISARIO: Do you need Sesame Street in Iraq?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we might.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't -- what?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of this is a lie.
BELISARIO: Do you support sending money in a Sesame Street in Iraq? I guess so.
What about the sex changes in Guatemala that we were sending $2 million to?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know you're talking about.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are they different in sex changes anywhere?
BELISARIO: Well, it's not federally funded here.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got me.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't comment on that. I don't even know I'm paying for that.
BELISARIO: That's why Elon is doing what he's doing.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well --
BELISARIO: He's helping you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We just all appreciate it. We really do. So thank you so much.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
MUSK: Thank you.
(PEOPLE chanting "Fight, fight, fight.")

Let's do some texts.
Chris from Cherry Valley, Illinois: I hope you gave Johnny hazard pay today.
He did a nice job.
Victoria from West Warwick, Rhode Island: Stephen Miller makes truth and accuracy sound sexy. Please thank Mrs. Miller for sharing.

Big O from Alabaster, Alabama: If Jasmine Crockett doesn't want her $5,000.00 I'll take it.
Lyz -- interesting spelling -- from Port Charlotte, Florida: Get the memo, Jesse, it's time to DOGE DEI Thursday.
Can't DOGE DEI Thursday until every DEI is gone.
Elias from Blacksburg, Virginia: Help. I'm stuck in my bathroom, and I fired the locksmith.
I mean, I've been stuck locked outside of my house. I've never been locked inside.
But listen, you need the locksmith or there might be a way to leave the key out. Not my business.
I'm Watters, I've never been stuck in --
