ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Top I don't think they're going to be able to just abolish the income tax like that, especially with a one-vote margin in the House, but this is what we've been waiting for.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": Yes, and it's going to be fun to watch and have you with us.
Ari, as always, thank you.
All right, that's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on Instagram. Lot of new videos up there.
Jesse Watters, he takes it from here.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS: Is this what we will see every single day ending in what the president has promised is millions and millions being deported?
THOMAS HOMAN, US BORDER CZAR: Yes.
WATTERS: Trump's message eff around and find out.
JD VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want that person in my country and I think most Americans agree with me.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our government is filled with the most incompetent and most lazy people. The people working for it are not doing what they need to do to take care of the rest of us.
WATTERS: Say goodbye to the lazy and the crazy.
Vivek joins PRIMETIME.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel bad for them at all.
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): You're going to think you're still going to get cheaper. They do not give a damn about the cost of eggs.
WATTERS: Now, the Democrats care about inflation?
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): It is 10 bucks to buy eggs, Rashida.
WATTERS: Plus --
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: I'm the king of the world.
WATTERS: One weekend and 47 is on a hot streak. Saturday, he decided to test his luck at a craps table in Vegas.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not bad.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.
TRUMP: Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good job. Thank you.
TRUMP: Thank you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: PRIMETIME never thought we'd see a sitting president in a casino, but as POLITICO puts it, Trump is everywhere again: "As fast as the movers changed out the White House furniture, the country went from an invisible president, unable to command the spotlight, to an omnipresent one who wants the public's attention at all times."
Trump is bringing head snapping change to Washington, overwhelming the system with a volcanic eruption of action. AXIOS says: "No modern president has done more across more areas of American policy, culture and life than Trump in the past six days."
The president hasn't even had the time to pick up his cell before last week, if you had Trump's number, a good chance he would pick up and talk. Not anymore. AXIOS says friends can't even get a hold of him. He wants to focus more on work. Trump world says the president has a chip on his shoulder.
His new motto, F-A-F-O, that means eff around and find out. And a lot of people are finding out.
The 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles are landing at the border alongside almost 2,000 members of the US military, and from LA to Georgia to Chicago, border czar, Tom Homan and his crew are busting up migrant gang hot spots. Almost a thousand illegals were detained just yesterday.
Overnight, agents rounded up dozens of Tren de Aragua gang bangers at a makeshift nightclub in Denver, before they could even finish their Coronas. They were caught holding drugs and guns when DEA kicked the door down.
In New York, a migrant with ties to ISIS was cuffed and stuffed in a paddy wagon. Biden was just letting the guy hang out.
Members of MS-13, some wanted for homicide, were scooped up in Boston. Homan says it was a good day, and they're just getting started.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RADDATZ: I want to go back to those military flights going south. As you said, we have never seen that before. Is that going to be a constant commitment from the US military every single day to --
HOMAN: Yes.
RADDATZ: -- to take deportees out?
HOMAN: Yes.
RADDATZ: So after you do that, then you go after everybody who is there illegally.
HOMAN: If you're in the country illegally, you're on the table.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACDONALD: Trump wants the removals to go faster, pushing Homan to hit quotas, 1,500 a day. Almost the end of the month, got to hit your numbers, Tommy.
Homan says he's planning on making the president a lot happier.
Haitians in Springfield are hunkering down waiting for Homan to drop the hammer. There's nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RADDATZ: What criminals are hiding in schools? Middle schools? Elementary schools? you're going to go into those?
HOMAN: How many MS-13 members are at age 14 to 17? Many of them. So look, if it's a National Security threat, public safety threat, what you need to understand is that it is case by case. Name another agency, another law enforcement agency that has those type of requirements that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or on a medical campus?
No other agencies have those standards.
The message needs to be clear: There's consequences for entering our country illegally. If we don't show those consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Police can arrest Americans in schools, why can't ICE arrest illegals there?
The media is complaining and Hollywood is crying. Actress, Selena Gomez, who is half Mexican, is very upset the dangerous illegals are being booted out of the country. Tom Homan says, sorry, not sorry.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HOMAN: We're going to do this job and we're going to enforce the laws of this country. If they don't like it, then go to Congress and change the law. We're going to do this operation with no apology.
We're going to make our community safer. We're going to save -- once we lock that border down with continuous operation, you're going to see fentanyl deaths decrease, illegal alien crime decrease, sex trafficking decrease.
It's just all for the good of this nation, and we're going to keep going. No apologies. We're moving forward.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The media is still taking the side of foreign nationals. Margaret Brennan at CBS says, come on. JD, many of these illegals were vetted.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JD VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't agree that all these immigrants or all of these refugees have been properly vetted. In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks on our country, that happened during the campaign, if you may remember.
MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: These people are vetted?
VANCE: Just like the guy who planned a terrorist attack in Oklahoma a few months ago, he was allegedly properly vetted.
BRENNAN: That was a very particular case. It wasn't clear if he was radicalized when he got here or while he was living there.
VANCE: I don't really care, Margaret. I don't want that person in my country, and I think most Americans agree with me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Sunday was the first time a foreign country told Trump it wouldn't accept their migrant criminals back. Two American military aircraft were in the air, headed to Colombia. The planes were packed with some bad hombres, Colombian nationals convicted of murder, trafficking, extortion, kidnapping, sexual assault, narcotics. The Colombian President refused to let the planes land, saying Trump was treating Colombians in an undignified fashion by putting Colombian citizens in handcuffs on a military plane.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How would you like to be the pilot of a plane? You've got two pilots up there, and you've got 300 people sitting in a plane, every one of them either a murderer, a drug lord, a kingpin of some kind, a head of the mob, or a gang member. And you're flying that plane, it's not going to end well.
You ever see the movie "Con Air"?
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: That's what -- yes, except here's the difference, the people in "Con Air" were actors. They weren't nearly as tough as these guys.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump was on the Front nine at the Row when he heard Colombia was refusing deportation flights, he immediately posted that Colombia would be hit with 25 percent tariffs going up to 50 percent the following week.
It didn't take long for AOC to start complaining about the price of coffee going up. Coffee hit a 45-year high under Biden, but now she cares about prices.
Before Trump even finished the round, the Colombian president caved and offered his own plane to personally pick up the migrants.
Trump has a mandate from the people, and he's using it. Just the threat of tariffs alone trounced Trudeau out of Canada, made Mexico reinstitute remain-in-Mexico, forced Colombia to take their criminals back and brought Denmark to the table to negotiate Greenland.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: This is a very different Donald Trump. He's leading a very different administration the way he is attacking things, and the American public is very much more in line with him than they were at any point during his entire first term.
KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Well, one -- one I would say, correction, this is not a very different Donald Trump. This is a very different Donald Trump as being viewed by voters in this moment.
ENTEN: In the way he is going about things.
BOLDUAN: I have a really hard time believing this.
ENTEN: This is a hundred percent true. I went back, I love spreadsheets. Donald Trump is the first guy ever whose net approval rating in the first month of his second term that's higher than any rating that he had is an entire first term, Kate Bolduan.
This is true. I don't make stuff up. The numbers are the numbers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: CNN hosts are calling their own polls fake news. I would never do that at Fox.
You notice what CNN is not showing on their screens, protests. During the campaign, CNN said Trump's mass deportations were illegal, immoral, and straight out of Nazi Germany, and now that he carrying them out, the whole country is like, eh, did you see the Chiefs game?
The American people were ready for change, and Trump is winning the battle for hearts and minds.
"The New York Times" admits the right owns the culture, and the left is losing the battle of ideas. For the first time in four years, people feel like Washington listened to them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHEN A. SMITH, HOST, "THE STEPHEN A. SMITH SHOW": What I'm saying is what resonated with the voter, what voter out there can look at the Democratic Party at this moment in time and say, there's a voice for us, somebody that speaks for us, that goes up on Capitol Hill and fights the fights that we want them fighting on our behalf.
They didn't do that, and that's why their behind at home, and that man is back into the White House, and they want to sit up there and tell you, you look at the networks right now they're talking about, look at it, this is the latest, look at him. Here he goes again.
Well, you know what here he goes again means? He's doing what he said he was going to do. He promised you he was going to do these things, and he walked into office week one, and that's exactly what he's doing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: They said Trump couldn't win. Tariffs didn't work and he wouldn't deport. They were wrong about everything.
This is what representative government is supposed to look like. They told you it was impossible because they never tried. And now here we are, just a week in and it looks like anything is possible.
Valuetainment founder, Patrick Bet-David joins me now.
All right, PBD, the Colombian deal over the weekend. Two hours -- done deal. We're not really used to that.
PATRICK BET-DAVID, VALUETAINMENT FOUNDER: No, we're not, but you're dealing with a different type of a guy who is -- you know, it's kind of like this, when I'm watching what he's done the first few days of being in office as a president, they showed a number the other day on how many executive orders he did on day one, Trump which is 26; Biden did nine.
Trump last term only did one on day one. Obama did zero on second; one on his first and Bush did none on day one. First or nor the second. He did three times more executive orders on his first day than the last four or five presidents combined. You're not talking about a regular guy right now.
This is like a team drafts a new quarterback, okay, and typically when your drafting, you're like, let me take the pictures. Let me go shake some hands. Let me go meet the sponsors. Let me do all of this other stuff, and then we'll start kind of training and practice in about four to six weeks.
This guy, day one is getting the defense, offense, everybody together. We're going over here. We're going to California; Colombia, you don't know what you're talking about.
When he posts, you know, F-A-F-O for those people that don't know who are church going type of people, you know, you can go Google it. Maybe you don't want to Google it. All it means is eff around and find out.
He's at a completely different place. And again, I said this last time I was with you, the energy he has, people are excited about him.
He's a trifecta today. He's feared, he is respected, and he is liked and loved, and he's getting a lot of things done.
WATTERS: Even if you don't agree with him, even if you're a Democrat who voted for Harris and Biden and Obama and all of these people, the fact that he's going and doing what he campaigned on doing, and doing it with such confidence and speed, people respect that.
I don't care how you feel about him personally. They respect the action that he is taking because they know he believes in it, and he is delivering for the country.
BET-DAVID: I mean, think about if you're in California and you're a full on liberal Hollywood actor/actress, that's you, but you just lost your home, okay? And you're waiting for Bass to do something, you're waiting for Newsom to do something, then you're talking to your spouse who voted for Kamala, who voted for Obama, who voted for Biden, who probably gave money to those guys.
But you're laying in bed late at night, and you're saying, Babe, at this point, I don't care if it's anybody, if they come to California to get things done, I'm convinced this guy -- please don't tell anybody -- but I'm convinced Trump's going to get more done coming to California than any of these other guys.
Again, this wasn't first week. I don't think everybody realizes how hard did you work this week? I want you to think about how hard did you work this week, and how old are you? This man is 78 years old. He probably outworked every single American this week.
Gave a speech to the World Economic Forum, called out the B of A CEO; called out all their -- you know, games that they play; comes to LA, calls out everybody; goes to Vegas, no tax on tips.
I mean, what he's done, you hear AXIOS and all of these other guys talking about how historic it's been for his first week. The question now becomes the following, I'm always a military guy. I mean, my background, being a business owner, you always have to make sure when you're going out there winning, your troops, the ones around you, have to always be five, ten, fifteen steps ahead of the enemy, assuming what games they're going to be playing.
When you're winning this much, there is a reason the most hated team in the NFL today is the Kansas City Chiefs, because nobody wants to see them win back-to-back-to-back.
So I would always be watching others to see what's being done behind closed doors to kind of tarnish the victories they're having right now.
WATTERS: And second hated probably is the Eagles, and they mostly just hate the sports fans in Philly, but that's okay, I still like my Birds there.
You talked about the pace that he's at, it is like being in the zone. They talk about athletes where they're not thinking, they're just reacting, they're just doing. You do it at work, you understand it, I understand it when you're just not really thinking at all, you're just taking action because you're good at it and you're getting things done.
He is in the zone right now, and he hasn't stopped, and people are looking at him like they've seen Trump for the first time. They're watching him without the media caricaturizing him, because the media can't. They don't have an opportunity to, and they don't even know how to anymore.
Here's Bill Maher, one of your good, good friends, PBD, who is admitting now the culture shifted. Trump is cool. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL MAHER, HOST, "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER": Here's how bad the Democrats (bleep) up. Trump is cool now. He's not just the most powerful guy in the world and just made himself like the richest. He's actually kind of, at 78, I mean, rappers like him, the athletes are doing -- I was making fun of him (bleep) two guys at one time, and now he owns it, and they're doing it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now, did Trump change? Or did a lot of the country change?
BET-DAVID: No. The other side had four years to present their argument, and they failed miserably. This is the beautiful thing about bad policies. Sometimes in life, Jesse, you have a job and somebody gets the promotion over you, and behind closed doors, you're like, there is no way that guy is going to do this job better than me. I'm more qualified than him.
You do your thing behind closed doors, your chance is going to come. The best time, the best part about life sometimes when someone gets a promotion over you, is everyone's going to realize that guy is not good at what he does.
The best thing that happened to the president and the American people is they gave the liberals, the progressives, four years, prove your argument, present to us why we should fund puberty blockers, present to us why we should be okay with imposing LGBTQ into schools, present to us all of this stuff, present to us why the borders should be open. Maybe you've got a better idea than they do.
Present to us why we should tell kids not to go to school because they're not essential. Stay home, COVID vaccine. Present to us why in the state of California, we should shut down all these restaurants, 50,000 restaurants America told to shut down. Tell us why these are good ideas.
Okay, we'll listen to you. Okay, we'll listen to you.
Wait a minute. There's something going on here. I don't know why I took this. Wait a minute. My kid is confused. Wait a minute. My kid is not happy.
They failed so miserably right now that this may not just be a one-term four-year thing. You may be looking at him, JD and others going for 12 years, because that's how embarrassing the opposite side's policies were and the world watched.
Everybody watched and said, you know what, we're done with this mess. We may not like everything about what Trump is. We may not like everything about conservatives because -- but at least they sound normal and they have commonsense. I'm going this way. That's what happened the last four years.
WATTERS: All right, PBD, great to see you. Valuetainment, and I'll see you next month there on your podcast.
BET-DAVID: I look forward to it.
WATTERS: Good to see you.
Vivek Ramaswamy is here, and he's got a lot to say.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Moments ago, President Trump announced the military is getting a makeover. Trump's building an Iron Dome around America. Soldiers fired for not getting the vaccine or returning with back pay, and trans troops, they are out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trans soldiers were getting sex change operations and billing the military for them, and the military, meaning you and I, were paying for it. These surgeries are like $150,000.00 and it takes a while to recover, plus they're injected with hormones and narcotics. No.
Say goodbye to the drag shows on military bases and CRT classes at West Point. Our officers will be learning about counterinsurgency strategy instead of white fragility.
Here's Hegseth.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETE HEGSETH, US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SECRETARY: And today, there are more executive orders coming that we fully support on removing DEI inside The Pentagon, reinstating troops who were pushed out because of COVID mandates, Iron Don for America, This is happening quickly, and as the Secretary of Defense, it's an honor to salute smartly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: After Secretary Hegseth walked into The Pentagon, he passed a note around. DoD does not equal DEI. No exceptions, name changes or delays. Those who do not comply will no longer work here.
The VA is cleaning house, too. Sixty DEI bureaucrats sent packing. One of them was making a quarter million dollars a year. To do what? We found an old DEI slide show where the VA talks about environmental justice and promoting access to voting. What's that have to do with veterans?
Well, the DEI guys are not happy. They are all about to get fired, and they have no skills to get a real job. One woke toadie at the State Department said this: "I would love to leave, but I don't know where I'd go, and I'm terrified of not being able to pay rent and not having healthcare."
A government worker at the Department of Labor was told to scrub the website of DEI. She then went into a closet, called her mom and wept.
Remember when Democrats told blue collar workers fired from building the Keystone pipeline to learn to code? I bet those guys found jobs faster than these DEI folks will. No one is even going to notice they're gone.
Here's a former federal employee.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The abuses that I saw by government employees was astounding.
When I was hired, my boss bragged that it was basically impossible to get fired from the federal government.
Another employee bragged about drunk driving and going out to lunch with her friends for margaritas when she was supposed to be remote working.
One employee would come into the office. His start time would be 6:30 and he knew nobody would be there, and when I came in at 7:30 and I was the next person to come in, he was snoring at his desk every single morning.
Our government is filled with the most incompetent and most lazy people, and an occasional hard worker.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: PRIMETIME doesn't take pleasure in Americans losing their jobs, but no one should have been in this line of work to begin with, and the Trump administration isn't going to tolerate undercover DEI agents or large swaths of the federal bureaucracy waging a secret war against him. "Those seeking jobs have been told they will have to prove their enthusiasm to enact Trump's agenda, and have been asked when their moment of MAGA revelation occurred. Answers that we will accept:
A: When Trump came down the golden escalator.
B: When his first inauguration had the most attendees of all time.
C: When he won the 2020 election.
D: When he said, "fight, fight, fight."
Or E: All of the above.
Without this type of screening, Al Sharpton's nephew could be working at Treasury, and you'd never know.
Sharpton lost his DEI grip on corporate America, but he's not giving up. Costco, apparently, is still DEI. So Sharpton took his crew there and said, DEI Thursday is alive and well.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
AL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: We will stand with those that stand with us. Costco immediately stepped out and said that they will not back off DEI.
We're going shopping at Costco because they stood with us. People that stand with us, we will stand with them. People that not stand with us, let Donald Trump stop us in 90 days from boycott them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Not a good look for Costco.
By the way, you have to show ID to get a Costco card. Someone should tell Al that's racist.
Vivek Ramaswamy is a founding member of DOGE and former presidential candidate. So we're hearing you're leaving DOGE after like three Scaramuccis.
What happened?
VIVEK RAMASWAMY, FOUNDING MEMBER, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: Well, the reality is, I'm pursuing elected office very shortly. We'll have an announcement soon, but Jesse, things are off to a great start. I think President Trump has proven -- look at the actions that he took that first week, the most pro-merit president I think we've had in a long time.
And as for my vision grounded in constitutional law in the future of the country, I think it's best pursued through elected office, and I'm confident they're going to succeed in slashing and burning that federal bureaucracy.
WATTERS: People are saying you didn't get along with Musk. What happened there?
RAMASWAMY: I think that's incorrect. But what I would say is we had different, complimentary approaches. I focused more on a constitutional law, legislative based approach. Musk is more on a technology approach, which is the future approach. No better person to lead that technology, digital approach than Elon Musk.
But when you're talking about a constitutional revival, it is not just done through the federal government, it is done through federalism, where states also lead the way.
So I'll have to be saying more on that very shortly, Jesse, but that's going to be my next stop.
WATTERS: All right, so Elon didn't fire you.
RAMASWAMY: No, we had a mutual discussion, and I think that I wish him well, we're on the same page where divide and conquer in saving the country. It's not a one man show from the top down or the bottom up. It's all of the above, and that's what I'm in for.
WATTERS: When you hear people say that these workers are going to get margs during work hours, what goes through your mind? I mean, how do you DOGE those people out of there?
RAMASWAMY: What goes through my mind is, I'm not surprised. The fact is, you've got four million federal bureaucrats, none of whom were elected to those positions in the first place.
And the dirty little secret is the people we elect to run the government, until this last November, the people we elected to run the government were not actually running the government. That changed when Donald Trump took office at Inauguration.
You have a US president that is actually running the show again. Look at that sweeping slate of executive orders. Look at fixing the immigration crisis. You had four years of illegal immigrants flown across that southern border in a matter of one week, we're now well on our way to sealing that southern border, ending these DEI programs, restoring merit. That's our American character that we miss, Jesse.
And the beautiful part about this is these were man-made problems. We've got a man-made solution, now we just have got to execute.
WATTERS: Is DEI dead? Because Al Sharpton, he's still in the trenches.
RAMASWAMY: Well, the funny thing about DEI, we use this word, ironically, it doesn't even stand for its own principles.
In the name of diversity, what happened is we sacrificed true diversity of thought and in the name of inclusion, we've created this new culture of exclusion where certain points of view just weren't welcome. That's un- American. It was neither diverse nor inclusive.
And DEI and merit, you've got to pick one. You can't have both. Either group quotas or meritocracy. There is no middle ground. And I think one of the things, not just the Republican Party stands for, but you can see vast swathes of the American population stands for, is that we stand for merit over group quotas. That's the American way, and I think that that's what made this country great.
WATTERS: What's happened to the Democratic Party? They're lost.
RAMASWAMY: They're lost in the wilderness.
Speaking as an American, I am rooting for a better version of that Democratic Party to re-emerge from those ashes.
WATTERS: We are?
RAMASWAMY: Because I think it'll make our it'll make our country better off to have actual competition.
WATTERS: Yes.
RAMASWAMY: Right now, they are lost in the wilderness. They bent the need to the woke left, far left wing, forgetting about the wing that focused on economic inequality, that used to be the focus of the left. They switched to all of this racial, gender, sexuality nonsense. I think they're going to have to figure out their part, that's not my job to figure out.
But I think for the Republican Party, having won, I think now is take that mandate and restore the country that we know with free speech, with merit, the pursuit of excellence.
We're not victims. Were done with this victimhood culture of the last decade or two in this country. We're not victims, we are victors, we are winners.
We don't whine. We win. That's the culture that Donald Trump is leading from the top, and I think that whether it's bottom up from the states or top down from the White House, that's what we want to see in this country.
WATTERS: Is the media winning because Acosta is being sent to the midnight shift, and Maddow has a pay cut that she has to take? What's going on?
RAMASWAMY: I think the market works. That's the short answer. As long as the free market work and people are able to make their choices, I think you're seeing people opt out of a lot of that media indoctrination.
People in this country, they're not dumb. They understand. You lie to me once, okay, maybe that was a mistake. You lie to me repeatedly, I'm cutting off that cord.
And so what you're seeing is a migration of people saying that if you lied to me before, I am no longer trusting you with that. Part of that came from the federal government.
Keep in mind, we still have a federal government that, look recently now is finally admitting COVID started in a lab in China.
WATTERS: Yes.
RAMASWAMY: We knew this years ago, and yet, only now, years later, is the government coming around to admitting it.
People are hungry for the truth. They're done with the lies. And I do think that what you've seen in the last year, it's a beautiful thing, is a lot of people now feel the permission to speak up, People in Silicon Valley, people here in Wall Street who would not have dared to say a word in favor of MAGA or President Trump, now able to speak their mind and say, there's nothing wrong with the idea of actually making America great again. We don't have to apologize for that. And I think it was President Trump's decisive victory that gave people that permission.
WATTERS: You'll be speaking your mind about your future pretty soon.
RAMASWAMY: Yes.
WATTERS: I can't wait to hear what that's going to be.
RAMASWAMY: Well, look, I'll tell you my home state where I'm from, I'm flying back tonight in Ohio. We look at the country over the last 20 years, Silicon Valley was at the bleeding edge of the American economy. I think the Ohio River Valley can be at the bleeding edge of the American economy for the next 20 years.
People leaving this state from New York or California. Right now, they go to Florida or Texas. I think places like Ohio should be where they're headed in the next couple of decades. Let's see what we can do.
WATTERS: All right, if global warming keeps happening, it's going to get really nice and sunny in Ohio. Vivek, good to see you. Good luck with everything.
RAMASWAMY: Good to see you, Jesse.
WATTERS: Appreciate it.
RAMASWAMY: Thank you.
WATTERS: JD Vance schools the Sunday shows and AOC getting very emotional.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: For the last four years, the left insisted Bidenomics was working, and Joe lowered inflation.

JOE BIDEN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I believe the economy I am leaving is the best in the world, and stronger than ever for all Americans.
KAMALA HARRIS (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under three percent.
STEVEN RATTNER, MSNBC ECONOMIC ANALYST: The economy is incredibly strong, as you guys talked about a little bit yesterday. And in fact, Trump is inheriting the opposite of what he says he is inheriting.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: But now that Trump is in office, their heads are exploding.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRENNAN: You campaigned on lowering prices for consumers. We've seen all of these executive orders. Which one lowers prices?
VANCE: We have done a lot, and there have been a number of executive orders that have caused already jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices. More capital investment, more job creation in our economy, is one of the things that's going to drive down prices for all consumers, but also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things that they need.
BRENNAN: So grocery prices aren't going to come down --
VANCE: If you look at our slate of executive orders, no Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it's going to take a little bit of time, right? The president has been president for all of five days.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats spent years wasting your money building anti racist oyster reefs and lesbian museums, sending prices to record highs, and they never said anything. But Trump is in office for one week, and it's like they all went to the grocery store.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I'm going to tell you all right now, they do not give a damn about the cost of eggs.
TLAIB: Eggs in my district are $9.19 and the 200 executive orders that we've seen this week is missing any mention -- any mention of lowering the grocery prices for our families.
SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): When President Trump pardoned all the January 6 rioters, now, to get rid of independent inspector generals, how is any of this going to lower grocery prices?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Someone should tell the Democrats that the egg prices they are so mad about are from December. Those are the big guy's eggs and egg prices might get even worse, because Joe just ordered the execution of hundreds of thousands of chickens because of the bird flu.
But somehow the left managed to blame Biden's existential crisis on White people.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELIE MYSTAL, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: The majority of white people voted for this. This is the disgusting version of America that people want and all by the way, eggs are still more expensive, so you even get that great job, White folks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: But fear not, a PRIMETIME producer spotted egg prices dropping nearly 20 percent this weekend, from $13.50 all the way down to eleven even.
O'Leary Ventures chairman and "Shark Tank" investor, Kevin O'Leary joins me now.
So O'Leary, are we just going to hear about prices all of a sudden from Democrats?
KEVIN O'LEARY, CHAIRMAN, O'LEARY VENTURES: Yes, I think it's a good talking point. The truth is, though, inflation took a long time to build up, and the most measurable are around proteins, eggs, cheese, meat, housing, either your rent or your mortgage payment and energy prices.
So from what I can see from the mandates brought in by the new administration Trump et al, they're attacking all of those making energy independence important and security, just make drill, drill, we know that story. That reduces all input costs.
Energy is an input cost across all 11 sectors, and so when you reduce the cost of energy, inflation comes down. Now, there's a whole lot of other issues around, you know, interest rates and everything else, but we had so many acts in the last four years that poured money from a helicopter into every sector.
I mean, you know, the Inflation Act, or whatever you wanted to call that thing, billions. I don't know why we did that. CHIPS and Science, Half of that's being completely wasted on companies like Intel, which are the loser companies in semiconductors. I would never invest in Intel. I don't know why my tax dollars have to. We should let the private sector do that through some form of tax credit.
All of these government programs, too much, too much at the same time, helicopter money. It's going to take a while to burn that off, Jesse, I would say, about two years to get inflation anywhere near two percent.
WATTERS: Wow, two years?
O'LEARY: Yes.
WATTERS: Well, Liz Warren, O'Leary says we don't have two years. If Trump doesn't bring prices down now, it's trouble. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): There are a lot of folks who are struggling to make it to the end of the month. Prices are going up. Price of eggs of $3.65 last November. The latest I have seen is four and a quarter. So there is a lot he could do. I hope he does it, but if he doesn't that it is our job to hold him accountable.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: I don't think she uses the pasture raised organic eggs like I do. They're a little bit more than three and a quarter, O'Leary.
O'LEARY: Listen, I love Elizabeth Warren and AOC. I think they're the best marketeers. They rant, they rave, they raise five bucks to 20 bucks at a time. They're marvelous at it. I hate their policies.
I left Massachusetts to go like everybody else, all my neighbors from Boston. That's where my family grew up, that's where my kids were born. We can't afford Boston anymore. Horrible tax policies.
But AOC rants and raves. She's really good at it. I've often said to her, let me partner with you in your t-shirt business. You've got 86 percent gross margins. She's living proof that inside every single socialist, there's a capitalist screaming to get out. I mean, I love that.
So look, they're very good at marketing, but frankly, their jurisdictions, I mean, Elizabeth Warren is something else but AOC, if I lived in her jurisdiction, I'd fire her. She's terrible.
WATTERS: Wow. I mean, the fact that AOC didn't jump at the chance to do business with O'Leary just proved she's a terrible businesswoman. I mean, everybody else, their hands up right now, where do I sign?
All right, O'Leary, good to see you.
O'LEARY: Take care.
WATTERS: It's too bad Massachusetts lost that big fat tax base of yours.
Breaking news on the Gulf of America.
Plus, Johnny at the boat show.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jesse, you're an ass (bleep).
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Donald Trump is redrawing the map with a little help from Google. Its maps will now show the Gulf of America instead of the Gulf of Mexico and Mount McKinley instead of Denali.
Obama changed the name of the Alaskan mountain to Denali in 2015 to please a group of Native Americans, but Trump is switching it back.
Glad we had the Google CEO at the Inauguration.
Now that Donald Trump is president again. Are people spending more? Are they buying boats? Are we in the Golden Age?
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
BELISARIO: The people are buying boats. Is this the Golden Age?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got to be the Golden Age.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have already sold more boats than we did in our whole boat show last year.
BELISARIO: This is the Pardo, the nicest boat at the whole boat show, I heard.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fresh in from Italy.
BELISARIO: Oh, that's why this nicest boat.
You've got to store this somewhere. You must have a big dock.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not a big dock.
BELISARIO: So your dock is pretty small.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a loaded question there, Johnny.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is made in America.
BELISARIO: Does this boat do any special tricks?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She rides very fast and very sturdy.
BELISARIO: Sounds fun.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A million five ninety-seven.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
TRUMP: Some people would say, well, that's out of the budget. I said, let me tell you something. There is no budget.
BELISARIO: How rich do you have to be to buy a boat?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You don't have to be rich to buy a boat. When there's a will, there's a way.
BELISARIO: When there's a Will, there's a Cain.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Cain? I don't get it.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WILL CAIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "FOX & FRIENDS" WEEKEND: You and me, we can go along that ride.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't say NDA, right?
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
BELISARIO: Does anyone know where the bar is around here?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Over here, we have refrigerated and freezer drawers, so --
BELISARIO: This is not where you hide the drugs, right?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it's pretty obvious.
BELISARIO: Why do women love guys with boats so much?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Rolling, rocky feeling.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Expect some martinis on the back.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They can take their selfies.
("ANYONE BUT YOU" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
BEN, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: They're gone. Show's over. Oh, my God.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The wind is in your hair.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Canning on a boat, snuggled up.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
TRUMP: Oh, he's in trouble.
BELISARIO: Electric boats, they're coming on to the scene. What do you think about them?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not a fan.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Think of the past. We're back to boating. Drill, baby. Drill.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You run out of battery, then what?
BELISARIO: The electric boat sinks. Would you rather be electrocuted or get eaten by a shark?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I could befriend a shark.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Being electrocuted sounds very painful.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd probably take my chance against a shark. You give them a right hook right to the nose.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've already gotten bit by a shark, so I'd choose that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think that's how I want to go on the newspaper.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But you want to be electrocuted? It would be fast, like shark pain, maybe he bites you and like you slowly bleed out.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think whatever's quicker, that's definitely I go. Whichever is quicker.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Electrocuted is definitely quicker.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm still saying shark.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
TRUMP: I will take electrocution all day long.
BELISARIO: Land Ho. What was the name of the boat the Pilgrims came in on?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How am I supposed to know this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's like the 19 -- like no 18 something ocean blue --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mayflower.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Green flower.
TRUMP: Gee. That was a tough one. That was a tough one.
BELISARIO: America's captain is back. Donald J. Trump. What was your favorite thing he's done so far?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm feeling a little safer right now.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The economy is going up. Stocks have gone up.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's cleaning house. I'll tell you that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to take Canada.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
ELON MUSK, CO-DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: Yes.
BELISARIO: I work for Jesse Watters. He sent me out here to buy him a boat, but he gave me no money. What should I do?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What should you do?
BELISARIO: You're going to comp this boat for me?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jesse, you're an ass (bleep) for sending this guy out in this hat.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take care of our boy, Johnny, and get him in a new boat, Jesse.
BELISARIO: Captain Johnny.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Captain Johnny.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm the king of the world.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: We're going to get Johnny a boat with some holes in it.
More PRIMETIME straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Big Watters Family Weekend at Monster Jam at the Prudential Center. The kids loved it. My favorite part was halftime, you do the motocross trick after trick after trick. These guys are crazy.
This is the Skills Competition. Just a little front nose. I don't even know what the name of that trick is, but the guy did it for like five minutes. It's ridiculous.
Family loved it. Gigi, Jesse, Jr., Emma took the shot. I'm obviously even more excited than the children.
We're going back next year.
Let's do some texts.
Chazz from Lewiston, Pennsylvania: Jesse, did you get paid for Friday's show? Trump did all the work.
That's what I love about the Trump era. I can sit not say anything and still get paid.
Greg from Salem, Alabama: Eggs are potentially chickens. Now the Democrats care about the unborn?
David from St. Marys Ohio: It sounds like Vivek wants to make Ohio great again.
Especially the Ohio River Valley.
Joe from Freeland, Washington: Johnny looked like a cross between the Skipper and Gilligan.
Yes, we're going to get him a kayak and hope he can't paddle.
Curtis from Huntsville, Alabama: You're paying Johnny too much if he thinks he's king of the world.
Yes, he walks around the office like that. It's ridiculous.
Sterry from West Lawn, Pennsylvania: No green tie? Very disappointed. Go Birds.
Tomorrow, I want everybody to tune in to "Special Report." If you watch the show, there will be a point that Bret Baier will be wearing an Eagles jersey. He lost a bet.
Can't wait till tomorrow.
John from St. Louis, Missouri: Chiefs message to the Eagles. FAFO.
Damn straight.
I'm Watters, this is my world.
