Cody Blissett The Old Capitol Building is seen in Iowa City on Tuesday, April 25, 2023.
On Dec. 17, 2024, the University of Iowa announced plans to close the Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Department, as well as its Department of American Studies.
In addition, the UI proposed ending the American Studies and Social Justice majors in favor of creating a new "School of Social and Cultural Analysis" along with a new major of the same name. 
The new school would combine UI departments and programs in the areas of African American Studies; American Studies; Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies; Jewish Studies; Latina/o/x  Studies; and Native American and Indigenous Studies.
Amid the shifting perspectives and attitudes toward DEI - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - policies, these studies are much too relevant. The university's decisions come at a time when such programs are increasingly necessary for understanding the world around us as well as for implementing related positive change. 
While the university's decisions may be explained by efforts to promote efficiency and flexibility, they seem laced with a bias as DEI-aligned content and courses are targeted by lawmakers.
DEI has become a charged term, and like with other issues, confirming a position in support of or against it nearly confirms a person's political alignment. 
Generally, a glimpse at support for DEI through a political lens shows that conservative Republicans tend to favor the rolling back of DEI protections with some being of the opinion they are inherently racist and discriminative. Liberal Democrats, on the other hand, view DEI as a necessity to ensure greater equality in a society where people often fail to do so on their own.
The changes to the university's departments so intertwined with DEI come after local political decisions made earlier this summer. However, discussions regarding department closure have been taking place for the past several years, according to the UI. 
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 2435, which, among other things, bars state universities from establishing, maintaining, or funding DEI offices unless otherwise provided by law or accreditation standards. This policy  is set to take effect July 1, 2025, the same time the proposed School of Social and Cultural Analysis  would open if approved by the Iowa Board of Regents.
Although there is significant overlap between the subjects of Reynold's ban and the aforementioned departments and courses offered, the senate file does not directly impact DEI-related areas of study. It explicitly excludes from its prohibitions academic spending on course instruction, research, student organization activities, guest speakers, or mental and physical health services. 
Still, it seems the university is not challenging these influences, particularly in anticipation of the new higher education review committee that will review Iowa's higher education system, curriculum, and spending.
And as Trump and his administration enter the White House again along with a Republican majority in the House, Senate, and Supreme Court, both political and politically influenced decisions like these are only expected to intensify.
Already, John Deere, Walmart, Mcdonalds, and Meta have confirmed ahead of Trump's appointment that they, too, will be complying with the trend ending several DEI programs designed to increase the hiring of diverse candidates. 
The university has cited several factors behind their proposal, including that the expiring majors have less than 60 students combined. And while it's undeniable that maintaining the departments and majors for such a small number of students feels superfluous and wasteful, eliminating them or combining them in ways that may limit the depth of content covered is not the answer. 
Instead, generating newfound interest and promotion of the content is crucial. 
The universal ideals and information in these curricula continue to exist and play significant roles in daily life. They are not going away simply because interested major numbers are dropping, and thus neither should the majors or departments. 
Encouraging students of all ages to explore these areas and even requiring some of the courses as general education requirements can help to provide their needed boost. Besides, we could all use a little extra compassion and understanding. 
The university's decision is ultimately a step toward less progress and more censorship. It seems like the university is headed in the same direction that much of the country is: backwards. But as an institution of higher learning and knowledge, it remains up to us to challenge and question this, to not merely follow the path others take but to forge new paths, to stand up for what we believe is right.
