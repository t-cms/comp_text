The following information was released by the office of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar:
Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN) released the following statement following President Donald Trump's executive order to revoke decades of diversity and affirmative action practices in the federal government.
"The blatant abuse of power by Donald Trump to end decades of diversity and affirmative action practices will have catastrophic impacts on women and people of color across the country. The order rolls back the clock on decades of government standards on diversity, equal opportunity, fairness that have been essential in building a more just country. Eliminating these public servants' crucial role in recruiting and retaining employees will only sabotage our ability to create a workforce reflective of the American people. The federal government has a moral responsibility to right past wrongs and address decades of discrimination against marginalized groups. Diversity has always been one of our country's core strengths and has only made our country better."
