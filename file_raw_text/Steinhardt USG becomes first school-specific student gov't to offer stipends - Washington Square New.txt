Steinhardt USG becomes first school-specific student gov't to offer stipends
Members will receive around $300 each semester, adjusted in accordance with their participation and attendance.

Sky Young, president of the Steinhardt Undergraduate Student Government, has spent the past four years working with university administrators, holding group discussions and meticulously reviewing budgets to compensate the group's e-board members. At the end of last semester, Young realized his goal, with the first round of $300 stipends reaching Steinhardt USG members over break.
Young told WSN that his commitment to the Steinhardt USG - roughly 8-10 hours per week - limited his opportunities for other work-study and other on-campus jobs and that other students had similar concerns. Coupled with the heightened cost of living, he felt that leadership in the Steinhardt USG would be more accessible if students were financially compensated. 
"We have gotten to a point, especially in New York City, where it is very difficult as a young adult to have a healthy living situation," Young said. "Students should have the chance to be part of student government - have the opportunity to be a representative in this school and push for changes." 
Young worked with Student Affairs Associate Dean Daniel Choi, who advised him to implement a compensation compliance system to adjust stipends in accordance with each member's attendance and contributions. Missing meetings or failing to meet expectations can yield deductions from the $300.
In an interview with WSN, Steinhardt USG Vice President Amanda Wang said the model will reinforce accountability and motivate members to meet the commitments and responsibilities their role entails, fostering a more professional environment. Wang also said she hopes the initiative will alleviate some financial challenges and create a more diverse group in leadership.
"Financial compensation can make leadership more accessible and equitable," Wang said. "Over time, this will enhance the quality of work and leadership within USG, benefiting the broader student body."
Young and Wang said they were met with overwhelming support from school administrators, and that they hope that other student governments across campus will implement similar measures. While the Student Government Assembly also provides $20,000 in stipends across its members, other school-specific governments do not. 
"Scaling our model across the university would help increase the presence of student government leaders across campus, both undergraduate and graduate," Young said. "Providing these stipends enables more students to get involved and hopefully allows for representation within populations that might not have been able to be part of these conversations."
