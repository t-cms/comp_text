National DEI changes lead Carbondale to monitor inclusion goals
By Jasmine Thompson, Staff Reporter

Lylee Gibbs | @lyleegibbsphoto Dr. Paul Frazier, Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, stands for a portrait outside of Anthony Hall Jan. 28, 2025 at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois.
President Donald Trump recently canceled a key executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 designed to prevent federal contractors from discriminating against individuals based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. This decision has reignited discussions around diversity, equity and inclusion programs, particularly in government and public services.
The White House asserts that this change is driven by the belief that DEI policies can undermine the significance of individual skills and hard work. However, critics argue that removing these protections may hinder efforts to cultivate an inclusive environment.
At Southern Illinois University, Chancellor Austin Lane emphasized the university's ongoing commitment to DEI efforts. "We are keeping an eye on these changes to DEI policies," Lane said. "So far, none of the changes require us to alter our current DEI initiatives. We remain committed to promoting diversity on campus."
Lane highlighted the Dr. Seymour Bryson Future Scholars Program, which supports diverse students. "This program includes students from various backgrounds and focuses on supporting their journey from orientation to graduation." He added, "Our priority is to treat everyone well, regardless of their background. A welcoming campus is about how we treat each other."
Paul Frazier, vice chancellor for diversity, equity and inclusion, echoed these sentiments: "My daily work hasn't changed. I'm focused on helping students and faculty, not defining myself by race or culture." Lane also said that the university employs diverse hiring practices and has established councils to ensure representation in hiring committees.

Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to supporting all students. Lane said, "Our goal is to help students succeed, no matter their background," while Frazier said, "We strive to ensure everyone feels they belong."
In contrast, the City of Carbondale is focused on maintaining diversity in its workforce. Mayor Carolin Harvey and City Manager Stan Reno said that having a diverse team enhances teamwork and productivity. 
Mayor Harvey said, "Right now, we are waiting to see what the federal government decides and how it will affect us. Nothing has been finalized yet." She emphasized the importance of DEI initiatives in city projects, stating, "We have a DEI position in our city dedicated to ensuring we involve minority contractors in our projects, whether it's road repairs or building new facilities."
Regarding hiring practices, Harvey said, "We are always looking for the most qualified person for the job, not just minority candidates. However, I believe DEI is necessary due to historical inequalities."
Reno expressed his views on the recent changes, stating that he has been with the city for nearly 28 years, mainly in the police department. Now that he is city manager, he oversees all city government functions and is working toward the positions of the city council and mayor.
Reno indicated that the city would continue striving for equal opportunities for underrepresented groups. He said, "We will keep our goals to ensure equal opportunities through city government while monitoring how these new federal guidelines might affect us." He also said, "The city will comply with whatever federal or state guidelines are set. My role is to ensure that we follow the law."
He acknowledged that DEI issues are not only local but also national concerns. "These concerns are common nationwide," he said. "We want to provide equal opportunities and comply with federal guidelines. Achieving diversity is still a key goal for us."
When asked about specific DEI efforts, Reno said, "We have set goals for including a certain percentage of minority workers on projects, but some of those goals are being reviewed in light of legal challenges. We want our city to reflect diversity in its workforce, businesses and residents."
As discussions about DEI continue, both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to inclusion. Harvey noted no decisions have yet been finalized, while Reno said, "We will maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce no matter what the federal changes may be."
