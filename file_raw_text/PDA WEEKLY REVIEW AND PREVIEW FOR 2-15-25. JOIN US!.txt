Much Done, and Much More to Do:
Here's How We Can Move Forward to Build the Resistance
First, we thank you so much if you were active with us over the past week.
It's of course been a whirlwind of jaw-dropping actions from Musk, Trump, and MAGA in general. So what else is new?
We've been just as busy working to turn this ship around. While the media is full of gloom and doom and much of it warranted our activist team members are putting their stress into positive progressive productivity!
Activist engagement is breaking records, we had two new chapters New Hampshire and Iowa boot up this past week, with more percolating.
We'll continue to work on building local action teams focused on protecting those community members who are especially potentially vulnerable as we ramp up to resist what Trump and MAGA and our unelected co-President Musk and his ilk have in store.
And at the same time we're working to bring home wins in the Special Elections for Congress in FL-01 and FL-06, with the elections in the first week of April.
We're on a roll. Please join us as we continue to work to bring peace and justice for all via progressive campaigns.
