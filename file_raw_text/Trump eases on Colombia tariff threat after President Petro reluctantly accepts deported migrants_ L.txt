Colombian president wants to have a whisky with teetotal Trump

After slamming Donald Trump's forceful approach to policy, and more generally, Americana, Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said he hopes to one day sit down with the U.S. president over a glass of whiskey.
But there's a catch: Donald Trump is teetotal.
Prior to reversing course and agreeing to accept two military planes of migrants being repatriated from the U.S .- and doing so, avoiding hefty 25 percent tariffs on Colombian goods imported to the U.S. - Petro wrote a scathing social media post about Trump's attitude towards Bogota.
"I don't like your oil, Trump, you're going to wipe out the human species because of greed. Maybe one day, over a glass of whiskey, which I accept, despite my gastritis, we can talk frankly about this, but it's difficult because you consider me an inferior race and I'm not, nor is any Colombian," Petro wrote on X in a post translated by Google.
"So if you know someone who is stubborn, that's me, period. You can try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance, like they did with Allende. But I will die in my law, I resisted torture and I resist you."

More DEI fallout: Air Force scraps course that used videos of Tuskegee Airmen and female WWII pilots
Sunday 26 January 2025 16:48
,
AP
The Air Force has removed training courses with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs - the female World War II pilots who were vital in ferrying warplanes for the military - to comply with the Trump administration's crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The videos were shown to Air Force troops as part of DEI courses they took during basic military training.
In a statement, the Air Force confirmed the courses with those videos had been removed and said it "will fully execute and implement all directives outlined in the Executive Orders issued by the President, ensuring that they are carried out with utmost professionalism, efficiency and in alignment with national security objectives."
The problem may not be with the historical videos themselves, but that they were used in Air Force basic military training DEI coursework. However, the lack of clearer guidance has sent the Air Force and other agencies scrambling to take the broadest approach to what content is removed to make sure they are in compliance.
The Tuskegee Airmen, known as the "Red Tails" were the nation's first Black military pilots who served in a segregated WWII unit and their all-Black 332nd Fighter Group had one of the lowest loss records of all the bomber escorts in the war.
They flew P-47 Thunderbolt, P-51 Mustang and other fighter aircraft to escort American bombers on dangerous missions over Germany. Before the fighter escorts began accompanying the slow and heavy U.S. bombers, losses were catastrophic due to getting dive-bombed and strafed by German aircraft.
In a statement late Saturday, Tuskegee Airmen Inc. the nonprofit foundation created to preserve the legacy of those pilots, said it was "strongly opposed" to the removal of the videos to comply with Trump's order.
The stories of the Tuskegee Airmen and the WASPs "are an essential part of American history and carried significant weight in the World War II veteran community. We believe the content of these courses does not promote one category of service member or citizen over another. They are simply a part of American military history that all service members should be made aware of," the group said.
