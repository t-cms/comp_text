REV. SHARPTON SLAMS TRUMP FOR BLAMING DEI, BIDEN, AND OBAMA FOR TRAGIC PLANE CRASH IN WASHINGTON, DC
Notes President Disregarded Loss of Human Life by Invoking DEI as Scapegoat for Any Incident Before Investigation Has Been Conducted
WASHINGTON, DC (January 30, 2025) - Rev. Al Sharpton, Founder and President of the National Action Network (NAN), today denounced President Trump's remarks blaming diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as well as past administrations for the tragic in-air crash that left 67 people dead in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.
"For Donald Trump to blame DEI or Presidents Biden and Obama for this horrific event, while first responders are still pulling bodies out of the Potomac, is a callous disregard for the dozens of lost lives, their families, and their loved ones," said Rev. Al Sharpton, Founder and President of National Action Network (NAN). "How can he make these brash statements when an investigation is barely underway? It doesn't matter if these were DEI hires or Ivy League hires. What matters is the families who are grieving, who do not want to see this moment politicized by a president bent on peeling back DEI policies. This only goes to show President Trump wants to use Black, Brown, LGBTQ, disabled, or other disadvantaged Americans as the scapegoat for anything bad that happens in this nation. My prayers go out to the victims and their families at what is undoubtedly the darkest moment of their life, and hope they find the resolve to make their way to the light."
