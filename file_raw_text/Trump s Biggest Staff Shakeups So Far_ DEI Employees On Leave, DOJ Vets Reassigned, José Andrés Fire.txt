Key Facts
The Trump administrationplacedall diversity, equity and inclusion employeeson paid leave Tuesday, a day after issuing an executive ordered designed to dismantle DEI policies across the federal government, and at least 20senior Justice Department officialshave also been reassigned, the Associated Pressreported, citing unnamed officials, as Trump takes aim at the agency he has accused of bringing politically motivated prosecutions against him.
Trump s personnel office is in the process of  identifying and removing over a thousand presidential Appointees from the previous Administration,  he wrote Tuesday on Truth Social, naming four appointees and telling them  YOU RE FIRED!  using his  Apprentice  catchphrase.
Trump said he dismissed celebrity chefJosé Andrésfrom the President s Council on Sports, retired Gen. Mark Milleyfrom the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, former Atlanta MayorKeisha Lance Bottomsfrom the President s Export Council, and his former Iran envoy,Brian Hook, from the Wilson Center for Scholars think tank.
Coast Guard CommandantLinda Fagan, who was two years into her four-year term and was not among the terminations Trump identified on Truth Social, was also terminated Monday by Acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamin Huffman, according tomultiple reports.
Though Huffman reportedly cited performance reasons for Fagan s termination, Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., took aim at Fagan last year ina letterderiding the Coast Guard s Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity inclusivity training, which they referred to as  indoctrination training. 
AndrésandBottomssaid they had already resigned before Trump s announcement, and while Trump didn t state his reasons for the terminations, Andrés, Bottoms and Milley have openly feuded with Trump, though it s unclear why Hook was fired.
Andrésbacked outof a restaurant deal with Trump after he disparaged Mexicans, sparking a two-year legal battle, and BottomscriticizedTrump s incendiary rhetoric toward protesters in the wake of George Floyd s death in 2020.
Milley who was pre-emptively pardoned by former President Joe Biden Monday and whose portrait was removed from the Pentagon called Trump the most dangerous person to this country  and a  fascist to the core  in Bob Woodward s  War. 
Tangent
Federal advisory council roles are typically unpaid positions with limited authority. Biden also asked some Trump-era appointees to leave their positions or be terminated,includingall 18 of his appointees to the boards of national military academies.
Key Background
The terminations were among a string of actions Trump took on his first day in office, including signing a flurry ofexecutive ordersto implement his campaign promises on immigration, energy, TikTok and more. Other executive orders addressed federal employees, including one that suspends hiring and another directing agencies to stop work-from-home programs. Trump is expected to implement broad cuts to federal bureaucracy, likely with the help of the new Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Trump also pardoned all but 14 people convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, effectively dismissing more than 1,500 cases or convictions. The Senate is in the process of holding hearings for Trump s nominees for cabinet-level positions, and Senate committees this week greenlit Trump s Defense Secretary nominee,Pete Hegseth, and Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent.
