New Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says there will soon be more executive orders from President Trump as he seeks to reshape and revamp the U.S. military.
Hegseth arrived at the Pentagon on Monday morning for his first day leading the department after  by the Senate last week. He referred specifically to Trump’s efforts to purge diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies from the federal government.
“There are more executive orders coming that we fully support,” he said. “On removing DEI inside the Pentagon, reinstating troops who were pushed out because of COVID mandates, Iron Dome for America.”
“This is happening quickly,” he added.
Trump has signed  since taking office a week ago, including reinstating service members who were discharged from the military for refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. They will receive their former rank and full back pay with benefits, the White House said in a memo.
The president also plans to sign an order that bans transgender people from serving in the military.
Hegseth was confirmed Friday, when Vice President Vance cast a tie-breaking vote after three GOP senators broke with their party to vote against him. He has faced multiple allegations of sexual abuse and of drinking on the job.
He spoke with enthusiasm outside the Pentagon on Monday, calling it the “honor of a lifetime” to lead the department.
“Every moment that I’m here, I’m thinking about the guys and gals in Guam, in Germany, in Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, on missile defense sites and aircraft carriers,” Hegseth said. “Our job is lethality and readiness and war fighting.”
“We will be no better friend to our allies and no stronger adversary to those who want to test us,” he added.
