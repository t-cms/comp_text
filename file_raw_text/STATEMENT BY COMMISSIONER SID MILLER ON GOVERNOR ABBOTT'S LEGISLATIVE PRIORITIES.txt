The following information was released by the Texas Department of Agriculture:
I applaud Governor Greg Abbott for using his State of the State address to highlight many of the same critical issues Ive been fighting forsupporting Texas families, our hardworking public servants, and the farmers and ranchers who keep this state running.
Finally, we are eliminating discriminatory DEI policies from the state government, a fight the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) has joined.
Texas must stay #1 in cattle, cotton, and our kids education. That means schools should teach, not indoctrinate. I fully support banning DEI in K-12 education and passing school choice. Parentsnot bureaucratsshould decide whats best for their children.
Water security remains a top priority, as agriculture and our states future depend on it. Last session's $1 billion investment, along with Governor Abbotts commitment to do more, is a crucial step forward.
Expanding rural healthcare is another necessity, and I appreciate the Governors commitment to ensuring every Texan, no matter where in our great state they may live, has access to quality care.
Texas has led the way in securing the border. Operation Lone Star proves it can be done, and now the Trump Administration is following our states lead. And lets be clearChina and other hostile foreign adversaries have no business buying our precious Texas land. Ill keep fighting until we put a stop to it.
These priorities reaffirm Texas as the national leader in agriculture, border security, and economic freedomvalues that align with President Trumps mission to make America strong, secure, and prosperous again.
