Ed Martin, interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has fired out an office-wide email vowing to protect workers in Elon Musk's DOGE outfit, according to Bloomberg Law and NBC News, which obtained copies of the mail.
"It is despicable that these men and women are being threatened," Martin writes, saying the problem of threats being made against Musk's government efficiency operations was first reported to him by a DOGE staffer.
He names his initiative "Operation Whirlwind" and claims to have already personally launched an investigation into Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over the matter.
"We are the DC US Attorney's office; we are the guardians of federal workers," Martin wrote. 
"You and I must do whatever possible to assure government work is safe for all involved. 
"We must protect our cops, our prosecutors, our DOGE workers, the President, and all other government employees from threats against our nation."

Schumer condemns Trump's 'disgusting' remarks on Ukraine

Joe Sommerlad
Here's a new statement from the Senate Minority Leader:
"In a Fox News interview released last night, President Trump spoke about the war in Ukraine and some of his comments sounded straight from a Russian propaganda playbook.
"Rather than speak the truth, rather than acknowledge Vladimir Putin's role in starting this war, President Trump, amazingly, blamed Ukraine for Putin's invasion.
"To quote the president: 'You should have never started it,' he said. He was saying that to President Zelensky.
"This is disgusting, after how this man has fought so hard and so valiantly. And it deliberately distorts the truth.
"It's just awful to see an American president turn against one of our friends and openly side with a thug like Vladimir Putin.
"It is shameful to hear the president repeat Putin's propaganda while laying the groundwork for negotiations that favor Russia at Ukraine's expense.
"The people of Ukraine did not start this war, Vladimir Putin did.
"Ukrainians have fought and died on the battlefield to defend their home.
"The suffering and destruction the Ukrainian country and the Ukrainian people have endured is staggering, all because of Vladimir Putin.
"And let's not forget, America: maybe there are some who say enough already. But if we give into Putin now, America will inevitably pay the price later. That's what history has shown. When you give in to thugs, when you give in to dictators, you pay the price. Hasn't Donald Trump and his allies learned the lessons of history?
"This is not just about the security of another nation - this struggle is in every way about the ultimate security of the American people.
"Make no mistake, right now the Kremlin is overjoyed by what Donald Trump is saying and what he's doing.
"Every single Republican must be put on the record for President Trump's dangerous and false statements about the war in Ukraine. We have an obligation in the Senate to take a stand for the truth and to take a stand against autocrats, and we will do it shortly.
"The American people deserve to know: will Republicans take a stand for democracy and freedom around the world, or will they cater to Putin and Russia, like President Trump is doing with ultimately bad consequences for all of us?"

Trump Media sues Brazilian Supreme Court judge who sparred with Musk

Joe Sommerlad
The president's Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has joined the video sharing platform Rumble in suing Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes in a U.S. federal court in Tampa, Florida, accusing the judge of illegally attempting to censor a "well-known politically outspoken user" of Rumble with orders to suspend that user's U.S.-based accounts.
Moraes happens to have clashed with Elon Musk last year in a battle that led to the temporary shutdown of X in his country. 
TMTG is weighing into the matter, according to the lawsuit, because Truth Social "relies on Rumble's cloud-based hosting and video streaming infrastructure to deliver multimedia content to its user base."
"If Rumble were to be shut down, that shut down would necessarily interfere with Truth Social's operations, as well," it adds.
The suit also comes a day after Brazil's prosecutor-general charged the country's former president, Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro, with orchestrating an attempted coup as he tried to remain in office following his 2022 election loss.

The Department of Government Efficiency claimed they had saved $8 billion by cutting a single contract - but the actual value was $8 million.
Elon Musk's cost-cutting team, tasked with gutting the federal government, claims it has saved a total of $55 billion, but a recently published list of contracts it has canceled so far only accounts for $16.6 billion, Bloomberg reports.
DOGE, upon further inspection, appears to have overstated the value of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency contract, which has since been corrected.

Trump fires back at 'modestly successful comedian' Zelensky in explosive rant against 'war that couldn't be won'

Here's the president's angry Truth Social response to his Ukrainian counterpart after he accused him of being taken in by Russian "disinformation" earlier, in which he even goes so far as to refer to him as a "dictator" and accuse him of presiding over a corrupt regime embezzling defense donations: 
"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and "TRUMP," will never be able to settle. The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe's money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back. Why didn't Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization, in that this War is far more important to Europe than it is to us - We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation. On top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is "MISSING." He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden "like a fiddle." A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only "TRUMP," and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the "gravy train" going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died - And so it continues....."

Judge temporarily blocks Trump administration from firing 11 CIA agents over DEI

Joe Sommerlad
Federal Judge Anthony J Trenga has temporarily blocked the president's move to force the dismissal of 11 CIA agents briefly assigned to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs within the agency.
The ruling comes after a group of anonymous intelligence officers, who had been temporarily reassigned to roles implementing DEI initiatives, filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the CIA - now occupied by Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe - to oppose their ousting.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, names ODNI, the CIA, and their respective heads as defendants.
The plaintiffs, identified only as "John Does 1-6" and "Jane Does 1-5," argue they are being unfairly targeted, with Judge Trenga agreeing and granting an administrative stay, meaning those concerned will remain on leave with full pay and benefits until the court rules further on the matter.

Martin O'Malley, the former commissioner of the Social Security Administration, ripped into "co-presidents" Trump and Musk on Tuesday, along with DOGE's band of "19-year-old nitwits," calling them the "biggest threat" to the continued existence of the 90-year-old program so critical to millions of Americans.
O'Malley, a former governor of Maryland who ran the agency during the last year of the Biden administration, mocked Musk's claims that millions of "zombies" from the age of 100 to 159 are collecting Social Security benefits.
"He has no idea what he's talking about," he told CNN anchor Boris Sanchez.

Musk weighs public $5k 'dividends' with DOGE savings he hasn't proven

Joe Sommerlad
The tech billionaire is considering paying $5,000 in "dividends" in the form of tax refunds to American households, using Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) savings he has yet to prove exist.
The plan, which Musk responded to in a post on X on Tuesday, was quickly mocked by critics on social media as way "premature."
One called the shaky offer an attempt to make the public "complicit in destroying our own government and country."
It's unclear if Musk's DOGE will ever have any "dividends" or if it will ultimately make any real inroads in the federal government's costs, given its crippling $36 trillion debt, and the massive $4.5 trillion tax cut Republicans are now considering.
The entire annual budget for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which Musk shuttered through DOGE, was a fraction of the possible future annual tax cut alone.

Joe Sommerlad
The president signed an executive order at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday aimed at expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) but it was not clear what concrete steps may be taken to make that a reality.
"The Order directs policy recommendations to protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt noted on X.
White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who appeared alongside Trump yesterday afternoon, outlined the executive orders signed there by the president. 
The IVF order relates to "the affordability and availability of in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments," said Scharf.
These are "treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans," he added. 
"The executive order is a directive to the Domestic Policy Council to examine ways to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans."
Trump followed Scharf, saying: "I've been saying that we're going to do what we have to do, and I think the women and families - husbands - are very appreciative of it."
But the order states that it "shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations."

Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, arrived in Kyiv this morning, according to local media reports, for a three-day visit as part of the administration's efforts to end Russia's war - and will no doubt find himself with some explaining to do in light of his boss's comments in Florida yesterday.
Upon arriving, Kellog said his mission was mainly to "listen" to Ukraine's concerns and report back to the White House.
"We understand the need for security guarantees. We understand... the importance of the sovereignty of this nation," the U.S. diplomat said.
"A part of my mission is to sit and listen and see what your concerns are."
The Kyiv Independent reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky offered Kellogg the chance to inspect the war's front lines, which he appears not to have taken up.
Kellogg and Zelensky met at last week's Munich Security Conference and discussed the war and the U.S.-proposed memorandum on Ukraine's rare earth minerals.

Trump and Elon Musk awkwardly likened to 'two brothers' as they seek to justify DOGE cuts in joint Fox interview

Joe Sommerlad
Later, an uncharacteristically subdued Trump was at times silent as he seemed to reluctantly share the limelight with wealthy Republican donor turned unpaid White House aide Elon Musk in an interview with Fox News personality Sean Hannity on Tuesday evening.
The SpaceX founder used the primetime slot to try to justify the sweeping cuts his so-called "Department of Government Efficiency" has attempted to make over Trump's first month in office as a needed corrective to a recalcitrant civil service that is resisting the president's demands.
Musk, who appeared alongside the 47th president during a joint interview taped last week for Hannity's eponymous program, described his role in the Trump administration as "tech support" and as a sort of enforcer for Trump's will against non-compliant government workers.
Trump in turn effusively described Musk as "a leader" who "gets it done" during the softball sit-down with Hannity, leading the partisan personality to describe the unlikely pair as remarkably fraternal.
There was plenty more about their relationship:
Musk: I'm getting sort of a daily proctology exam

Trump calls for 'radical transparency' from government
07:45

Namita Singh
Donald Trump has issued a presidential memorandum calling for "radical transparency requirements" from the government, which he suggested could reduce wasteful spending.
The order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of Management and Budget, while the memo requires the government to detail the "waste, fraud and abuse" that's found as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), overseen by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, looks to cut government spending.

DOGE has often fallen short of the administration's promises of transparency. Musk has taken questions from journalists only once since becoming Trump's most powerful adviser, and he's claimed it's illegal to name people who are working for him. 
Sometimes DOGE staff members have demanded access to sensitive government databases with little explanation.

President Donald Trump made a major decision for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments as he signed executive order to expand access and reduce the costs of IVF.
Welcoming the decision, Barbara Collura, president of Resolve, the National Infertility Association, said that what the White House put out "looks extremely promising".

"The biggest barriers for people to building their families are the out-of-pocket costs, the lack of insurance coverage for this care," she said.
Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat, said: "Donald Trump's executive order does nothing to expand access to IVF. In fact, he's the reason IVF is at risk in the first place."
Duckworth said if Trump is going to follow through on his campaign promise to provide free IVF, he can start by supporting her legislation that would require insurance plans to cover IVF.  
Trump signs order to study how to expand IVF
06:55

Namita Singh
President Donald Trump signed an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilisation (IVF).
On the campaign trail, Trump called for universal coverage of IVF treatment after his Supreme Court nominees helped to overturn Roe v Wade, leading to a wave of restrictions in Republican-led states, including some that have threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at conception.
Trump said he thinks "women and families, husbands, are very appreciative" of his executive order on IVF, which offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant.
The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilised embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy. IVF is done in cycles, and more than one may be required.

Report: U.S. pauses applications by migrants permitted entry under Biden parole programs
04:55
,
Oliver O'Connell
 reported late Tuesday that the Trump administration has paused all immigration applications submitted by migrants from Ukraine and Latin America who were permitted entry into the United States under certain Biden-era programs.
The report added that concerns about fraud and security were cited as reasons for the halt, citing two U.S. officials and an internal memo.
The move, which had not been previously reported, threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who were applying for various immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally - sometimes permanently.
While the exact number of affected migrants remains unclear, the hold on applications pertains to several Biden administration programs that permitted hundreds of thousands of foreigners to enter the U.S. legally through an immigration law known as parole. This law enables the U.S. government to swiftly welcome foreigners for humanitarian reasons or public benefit grounds.
The Biden administration used parole on an unprecedented scale, partially to encourage migrants to apply for legal migration channels instead of crossing the southern border unlawfully. The Trump administration swiftly moved to suspend those efforts, arguing that they were an abuse of the parole authority.
