The following information was released by the U.S. Department of Education:
Department's Action Follows President's Executive Order
Last week, following President Trump's Executive Order, "Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing," the U.S. Department of Education took several steps to dismantle its Biden-era DEI programs and practices.
Here's what they are saying about the Department's week one actions:
U.S. Department of Education Takes Action to Eliminate DEI
USA Today: "U.S. Department of Education officials moved swiftly this week to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion measures and staff following President Donald Trump's executive order Monday rolling back such provisions across the federal workforce."
Eric Schmitt, U.S. Senator for Missouri: "Not tired of winning."
Tiffany Justice, Co-founder of Moms for Liberty: Celebrate a new chapter at @usedgov! They've embraced a fresh start by discontinuing the DEI Council, along with its Equity Action Plan, and redirecting $2.6 million previously allocated for training contracts. All team members involved are now on a well-deserved leave. Cheers to a revitalized focus and exciting new directions ahead!"
Riley Gaines, Host of Gaines for Girls podcast: "DEI was a house of cards since its inception, and its finally crumbling. Such a glorious sight to behold."
Ed Wheelan, Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center: "Very encouraging to see prompt agency action implementing Trump's executive order."
U.S. Department of Education Ends Biden's Book Ban Hoax
The New York Times: "The move, immediately hailed by conservative groups, represents a significant whittling-down of the department's traditional authority as President Trump's incoming administration makes rapid strides toward its goal of relinquishing oversight of education to the states."
Caroline Downey, National Review: "Trump's Department of Education just dismissed the Biden admin's 11 complaints of so-called book banning against school districts that wanted to get porn and obscene material OUT of children's libraries. Parental rights are going to be great again."
Nicki Neily, Founder and President of Parents Defending Education: "The Biden Admin's crusade against so-called "book banners" was nothing more than a smear campaign against parents concerned about age-inappropriate content and lack of transparency in schools. Ending these OCR investigations is a win for parental rights and common sense. Thank you to President Trump and the Department of Education for moving swiftly to correct the record and dismiss these complaints."
Christopher Rufo, Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute: "The Department of Education has terminated President Biden's program to investigate so-called "book bans." The Trump Administration understands that restricting pornography in elementary schools is not a "book ban" it's common sense."
