Nearly half a billion dollars in food assistance was at risk of dissolving, and more than 500,000 metric tons of food was sitting out, waiting to be shipped, and is now at risk of spoiling, according to the USAID inspector general's report.
USAID staff also reported that counter-terrorism vetting units supporting humanitarian assistance programming had been "told not to report to work ... and thus cannot conduct any partner vetting."
Trump's sledgehammer approach to USAID and the "uncertainty about the scope of foreign
assistance waivers and permissible communications with implementers" has "degraded USAID's ability to distribute and safeguard taxpayer-funded humanitarian assistance," the report says.

Trump to loosen enforcement of US law banning bribery of foreign officials
Monday 10 February 2025 22:24
,
Oliver O'Connell
President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order today directing the Justice Department to pause prosecutions of Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials to gain business in their countries.
According to a copy of a fact sheet reviewed by Reuters, the order aims to restore American economic competitiveness by requiring "revised, reasonable enforcement guidelines for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977."
"American national security depends on America and its companies gaining strategic commercial advantages around the world, and President Trump is stopping excessive, unpredictable FCPA enforcement that makes American companies less competitive," the fact sheet said.
The order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to suspend enforcement of the FCPA until she provides updated enforcement guidance that encourages American competitiveness, according to the fact sheet.
"Future FCPA investigations and enforcement actions will be governed by this new guidance and must be approved by the attorney general," the fact sheet said.
The White House argued that U.S. companies are harmed by FCPA "overenforcement because they are prohibited from engaging in practices common among international competitors, creating an uneven playing field," the fact sheet said.
The order mentions the need for strategic advantages in critical minerals, deep-water ports, and other key infrastructure or assets worldwide to enhance U.S. national security.
According to the fact sheet, in 2024, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated 26 enforcement actions related to the FCPA, and by the end of the year, at least 31 companies were under investigation.

Judge to continue pause on Trump's federal worker buyout offer

Alex Woodward
A federal judge will continue to pause the Trump administration's so-called buyout offer for tens of thousands of federal employees, hours before a midnight deadline for their response to a "deferred resignation" offer.
The offer claimed workers would be placed on paid leave through September 30 with no expectation of work. ("You are most welcome to stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination. Whatever you would like," the Officer of Personnel Management website states.) Employees who did not take the offer were not guaranteed they would keep their jobs.
Last week, District Judge George O'Toole temporarily blocked the offer following a lawsuit from federal worker unions arguing that staff were forced into an "arbitrary, unlawful, short-fused ultimatum."
A deadline was pushed to Monday at midnight.
Following a hearing on Monday, O'Toole once again extended that delay, until he rules on a preliminary injunction that could block the deal altogether.
As of Friday, roughly 65,000 people, or 3 percent of the federal workforce, had already accepted the buyout.

The American Bar Association has offered a blistering assessment of what it describes as "wide-scale affronts to the rule of law itself" from the Trump administration.
Here's what William R. Bay, president of the American Bar Association, wrote: 
Most Americans recognize that newly elected leaders bring change. That is expected. But most Americans also expect that changes will take place in accordance with the rule of law and in an orderly manner that respects the lives of affected individuals and the work they have been asked to perform.
Instead, we see wide-scale affronts to the rule of law itself, such as attacks on constitutionally protected birthright citizenship, the dismantling of USAID and the attempts to criminalize those who support lawful programs to eliminate bias and enhance diversity.
We have seen attempts at wholesale dismantling of departments and entities created by Congress without seeking the required congressional approval to change the law. There are efforts to dismiss employees with little regard for the law and protections they merit, and social media announcements that disparage and appear to be motivated by a desire to inflame without any stated factual basis. This is chaotic. It may appeal to a few. But it is wrong. And most Americans recognize it is wrong.
It is also contrary to the rule of law.
The American Bar Association supports the rule of law. That means holding governments, including our own, accountable under law. We stand for a legal process that is orderly and fair.
We have consistently urged the administrations of both parties to adhere to the rule of law. We stand in that familiar place again today. And we do not stand alone. Our courts stand for the rule of law as well.
