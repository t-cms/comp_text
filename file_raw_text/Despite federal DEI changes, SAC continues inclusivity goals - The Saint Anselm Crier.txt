Despite federal DEI changes, SAC continues inclusivity goals
Susie Ketler, Crier Staff
February 6, 2025
In the first month of his second presidency, President Donald Trump has begun issuing multiple executive orders so as to disassemble previously issued Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. So far, the president has signed orders entitled "Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity" and "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing," which mainly affect those involved in federal agencies and the military. Service members who have been dismissed for refusing to receive COVID-19 vaccinations are also permitted to return to active duty under these orders. In Trump's view, these DEI programs he's sought to dismantle favor certain people based on race and gender, and diminish meritocracy, and therefore, were important enough to focus on as early as January 2025. 
Unsurprisingly, these choices evoke very strong reactions from the people of the United States, and many wonder how these new executive orders will affect themselves. Some would concur with the Trump Administration, that civil rights laws are violated through DEI, fostering division within federal institutions. Others however, like the American Civil Liberties Union , would argue that all these orders effectively achieve is the reversal of progress made toward inclusivity and equal opportunity. Civil rights protections like DEI, they maintain, are absolutely necessary so as to lead society in the right direction, and not to repeat history. 
While these orders have the greatest effect on federal institutions and the military, private sector practices will also have to change in accordance with the new orders. Private organizations, particularly those that are funded by federal contracts, but otherwise as well, are prohibited from implementing DEI practices, thus revoking certain provisions of the 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity order. This may be frightening to many, as a failure to cease DEI practices within the allotted 90 day period will result in contract termination, or at the very least, reassignment. 
While President Trump's recent provisions have not yet extended to public and private universities, it is still foreseen that these institutions will notice significant implications regarding their admissions processes and diversity programs. Being a private institution, Saint Anselm College may experience indirect changes from his executive orders. Though it is typically unaffected by federal mandates, because of federal funding and participation in federal programs, different private institutions are likely going to face pressure to align with these new decrees.  Story continues below advertisement
Here at Saint Anselm College, the steadfastly held beliefs about community are likely to stay intact. According to the Chief Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Officer of the college, Stephanie M. Fernandez, "At this time, the full impact of President Trump's executive order remains uncertain. However, we are committed to continuing to lead through our mission, grounded in the Benedictine values of community, stability, and hospitality. Our focus remains on fostering an inclusive environment where all students, faculty, and staff are valued, and we will navigate any changes with the care and dedication that reflect our core principles. While the future is still unfolding, we remain steadfast in our commitment to serving all members of our community with dignity and respect."
