Grinnell College plans to retain DEI under threats of federal funding loss
Thai Theodoro, Staff Writer
February 23, 2025
ET Ourn
Grinnell College faces a potential financial crossroads as the Trump administration threatens to pull federal funding of colleges that maintain commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. With a renewed push to dismantle what it calls "discriminatory" admissions policies, the administration has issued an ultimatum: colleges and universities must scrap diversity initiatives or lose federal dollars.
In a Feb. 14 memo, the Department of Education gave educational institutions that receive federal funds an ultimatum to stop using "racial preferences" as a factor in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other areas. The department imposed a two-week deadline to end any practice that treats students or workers differently because of their race. The sweeping demand threatens to upend aspects of campus operations ranging from college application essays to classroom lessons and clubs. 
This two-week notice federal order has sparked uncertainty for both public and private higher education institutions. Public and private higher education institutions which now face potential cuts to federal research grants, student financial aid, and other funding if they fail to dismantle DEI-related programming.
"It's incredibly terrifying that what's been backed up by science over and over again, and then my rights are essentially just transient privileges that can be given back or taken away based on who the current administration is at the time," Jax Sylvester `28 said. 
The University of Iowa, a public research institution just an hour away from Grinnell, stopped recognizing or supporting diversity councils, including the African American Council, Latinx Council, Veterans and Military Council, and Native American Council, in compliance with a state-level crackdown through Senate File 2435 of Iowa Code chapter 261J.
Members of the Iowa House of Representatives have also moved to restrict DEI programming at private colleges and universities. On Feb. 12, the Iowa House's committee on higher education recommended the passage of HSB 60. If enacted, the bill would prohibit private institutions that participate in the Iowa tuition grant program from establishing diversity, equity, and inclusion offices. The Iowa Tuition Grant offers up to $8500 per year to Iowa residents attending in-state private colleges and institutions.

There are no plans to change any programs at this time
- Marc Reed, Vice president for diversity, equity, and inclusion
Despite the challenges to DEI at the state and federal level, Grinnell's administration has not issued any campus-wide statement. However, Marc Reed, vice president for diversity, equity, and inclusion and chief diversity, emphasized on the College's commitment to DEI programs in an email to The S&B.
"There are no plans to change any programs at this time," wrote Reed. "Our work is focused on creating opportunity for everyone to see themselves reflected in the institution's fabric regardless of race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, veteran status or any other protected class. This is what it means to comply with the law."
Across the U.S., other colleges are grappling with the effects of Trump's administration's ban on DEI programs. In Boston, Northeastern University renamed its Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion's website to the "Office of Belonging." In New Jersey, a session at Rutgers University catering to students from historically Black colleges was canceled abruptly. 
"Our approach to working with students remains steady and responsive," Vrinda Varia, associate chief diversity officer for student affairs, said. "We are hoping to grow responsive action by engaging the cultural center advisory boards and multicultural leadership council in ongoing conversation related to affinity communities and campus climate."
At Grinnell College, identity groups and advisory boards are an important part of the student experience.
"When I applied for that job [at the Disability Cultural Center], I had a vision for that kind of positive impact that I wanted to make on our campus," said Hannah Pallister `25, disability cultural ambassador at Grinnell. "Just knowing that there is a possibility that might change how I do that job and how I interact with other students is worrying to me." As a private institution, Grinnell College is not governed directly by state mandates in the same way public universities are. However, private colleges still rely on federal student aid programs like Pell Grants and federal loans, federal research grants from sources like the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education and other government-based funding or partnerships.
Grinnell has long framed DEI as an indispensable component of its mission. 
"Grinnell College has long identified a diverse community as one of its core values. But it is not enough simply to believe a value is intrinsic; it must be lived every day," wrote College President Anne Harris in a February 2021 "President's Message." 
"
My rights are essentially just transient privileges that can be given back or taken away based on who the current administration is at the time.
- Jax Sylvester `28
President Harris's 2021 message announced the creation of a three-member DEI cabinet. The cabinet's current members include Marc Reed, associate chief diversity officer for staff, Vrinda Varia, assistant chief diversity officer for intercultural student life and Caleb Elfenbein, associate dean for faculty development and DEI.
The College's Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion oversees a range of initiatives that could become legal liabilities under the new directive. The division also supports the recruitment of underrepresented students, staff and faculty, as well as scholarships or grants intended for underrepresented groups. Such targeted efforts could draw scrutiny under the new federal memo, which states it is unlawful for colleges to eliminate standardized testing requirements "to achieve a desired racial balance or to increase racial diversity."
