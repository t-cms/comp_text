WVU is closing its Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, per an announcement sent to students' WVU MIX emails Thursday.
In light of the closure, the WVU Division of Campus Engagement and Compliance has been created to comply with federal and state guidelines and requirements under Title IX and the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the release.
"This is not a rebranding, but a shift in focus that will align with the Governor's directive," the release said.
The closure of the DEI Office and creation of the new unit is part of the University's compliance with a federal executive order issued by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 and West Virginia Gov. Morrisey's Executive Order No. 3-25.
"While it will take time to determine the full scope of the Executive Order, as well as the subsequent federal executive order issued by President Trump, the University is taking immediate steps to comply," the release said.
The University has been "diligently reviewing" Gov. Morrisey's order and engaging with University stakeholders and members of the campus community, according to the release. The review aims to provide more specific "unit-level guidance" and information to the WVU community.
"The University is committed to keeping the WVU community informed throughout this process and will continue to provide regular communication and feedback as it works to ensure it is in compliance with any and all obligations," the release said.
The release directs those with questions to contact Vice President Meshea Poore at  and Associate Vice President Travis Mollohan at
