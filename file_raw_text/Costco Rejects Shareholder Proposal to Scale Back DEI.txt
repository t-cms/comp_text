Highlight: Costco's stance in support of DEI contrasts with the positions taken by other big consumer brands, including Walmart and McDonald's.
Body


Costco is rejecting a shareholder proposal that calls for a review of the business risks posed by its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, highlighting its commitment to a workplace grounded in respect and inclusion.
As other U.S. companies scale back their DEI initiatives,  remains steadfast in defending its approach, urging shareholders to reject the motion during the company's annual meeting on Thursday.
Newsweek has reached out to Costco for comment via email.
Why It Matters
This development reflects the ongoing debate surrounding corporate diversity practices, particularly after the U.S. 's decision in July 2023 to outlaw affirmative action in college admissions.
The controversy surrounding Costco's DEI initiatives comes as several major U.S. corporations have retreated from similar programs, fearing legal and reputational risks. Costco's decision to maintain its stance provides insight into how large companies navigate the complex intersection of diversity policies and shareholder interests.
What to Know
The , a conservative think tank, proposed that Costco assess potential business risks related to its DEI practices. The group argues that Costco's diversity efforts could pose legal, reputational, and financial risks, affecting shareholders' returns. The board of directors, however, voted unanimously to reject the motion, asserting that their commitment to DEI is "appropriate and necessary" and that the requested report would not provide valuable insights.
Context of Broader Corporate Trends
Costco's stance on DEI contrasts with the moves made by other large consumer companies. Retail giants including , , and John Deere have seen shareholders challenge or express concerns over their diversity initiatives.
Last week, over 30 Walmart shareholders urged the company's CEO to clarify the affect of scaling back DEI programs, describing the decision as "disheartening."
Legal and Political Context
Emboldened by the Supreme Court's ruling, conservative groups are targeting corporate DEI policies, particularly those focusing on historically marginalized groups. On Monday, President  signed an executive order aimed at eliminating DEI programs within federal agencies, echoing long-standing conservative critiques that such policies violate the U.S. Constitution by factoring in race, gender, and sexual orientation in hiring and promotion practices.
What People Are Saying
Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData's retail division said: "I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely.'"
The National Center for Public Policy Research said, Costco's DEI initiatives hold "litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders."
What Happens Next
Costco's firm defense of its DEI policies, despite external pressure, underscores the growing divide in corporate America on diversity issues. As more companies reassess their approach to inclusion, Costco's continued adherence to its policies may serve as a benchmark for others navigating the increasingly polarized debate over corporate diversity programs.
