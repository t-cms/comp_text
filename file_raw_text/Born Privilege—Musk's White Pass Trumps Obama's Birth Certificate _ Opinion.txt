Highlight: Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration, particularly his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), raises serious questions about the concentration of power in the hands of unelected individuals

In 's America, a Hawaiian-born Black man elected by millions is an eternal suspect. A South African-born white billionaire nobody voted for, however, is handed the keys to the White House. This perverse inversion unmasks MAGA's racial calculus, where "Americanness" is measured in shades of white, not ballots cast.
During 's presidency, Trump was one of the loudest voices fueling the "birther" conspiracy theory, falsely claiming Obama wasn't born in the United States. In 2012, Trump tweeted: "An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Barack Obama's birth certificate is a fraud." This unfounded allegation persisted despite clear evidence, compelling Obama to take the unprecedented step of releasing his long-form birth certificate.
Now, in an ironic twist that would be comical if it weren't so alarming, Trump has empowered —a man actually born in Africa—with significant control over government operations. As , a diplomat and representative at the  Economic and Social Council, pointed out on X (formerly ), "Trump insisted that Obama was born in Africa and now has a guy who's literally born in Africa running everything."
This juxtaposition not only highlights the racial bias in American politics but also demonstrates how drastically the norms of presidential behavior and accountability have shifted. The contrast is stark—Obama, with his Kansas-born mother and childhood spent partly in Hawaii and Indonesia, had to repeatedly prove his legitimacy, while Trump, who propagated racist conspiracy theories, faced minimal long-term consequences and even ascended to the presidency—twice. Now, Trump hosts Musk, who didn't set foot in North America until he was 17, granting him a platform in the heart of American democracy to defend controversial policies and make broad, often misleading claims.
Musk's role in the Trump administration, particularly his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), raises serious questions about the concentration of power in the hands of unelected individuals. Musk defended his cost-cutting efforts, claiming they were "." However, his team's operations remain largely opaque, with Musk himself insisting on "" while working in relative secrecy.
Moreover, it sets a dangerous precedent for future administrations, blurring the lines between elected authority and plutocratic influence. The long-term ramifications of this power shift could reshape international relations, weaken democratic norms globally, and fundamentally alter the nature of American governance for generations to come.
The spectacle of Trump, who spent years propagating lies about Obama's birthplace, now empowering Musk, a naturalized citizen, with unprecedented control over government operations is egregious. It's a scathing indictment of America's hypocrisy and a reminder of how deeply entrenched racism continues to shape American politics.
The MAGA worldview has redefined who represents America on the global stage and who wields power over fellow citizens. A Black, American-born leader with an overwhelming electoral mandate faced relentless scrutiny, while a white billionaire is embraced. This jarring contrast exposes the racial underpinnings of their concept of American identity and leadership.
What's equally concerning, yet woefully undercovered, is how this racial double standard coincides with the systematic dismantling of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government. Trump's executive order is an attempt to undo progress and erode structures designed to promote diversity and combat systemic racism.
Trump's obsession with Obama's origins was never about citizenship. It was a calculated effort to delegitimize the first Black president by cynically exploiting deep-seated prejudices. That Trump embraces Musk, an immigrant executive from South Africa, lays bare the true nature of his worldview—complexion, not nationality, determines who belongs in the corridors of power. This reversal demonstrates how quickly exclusionary rhetoric crumbles when it no longer serves its discriminatory purpose.
The Trump-Musk administration threatens to reshape American society in profound and troubling ways. The glaring disparity between the treatment of Obama and Musk lays bare an uncomfortable truth—in their vision of America, the color of one's skin still dictates the rules of the game.
As we stand at this crossroads, we must ask ourselves: Will we allow this regressive tide to pull us backward, or will we push forward toward a more inclusive and equitable America? The answer to this question will define not just the next election cycle, but the very soul of our nation.
