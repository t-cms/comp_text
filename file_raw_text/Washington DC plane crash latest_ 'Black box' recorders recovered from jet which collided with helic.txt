President Donald Trump used a deadly air crash that killed three Army aviators and 64 passengers and crew aboard an American Airlines jet to attack his two Democratic predecessors and falsely suggest the tragedy was the result of diversity initiatives in government.
In his first visit to the White House briefing room since returning to the presidency last week, Trump initially offered a moment of silence for the victims and praised the efforts of first responders after the crash, which took place just before 9 p.m. ET at Reagan National Airport outside Washington.

Donald Trump has signed an executive order effectively blaming Joe Biden and DEI for horrific DC mid-air crash.
The order is titled "Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety."
The order states: "In light of the damage done to aviation safety by the Biden administration's DEI and woke policies, what this presidential memorandum orders is your secretary of transportation and FAA administrator... to basically ensure that we are actively undoing all of that damage."
"We want the most competent people," Trump said. "We don't care what race they are. We want the most competent people, especially in those positions. 
"You're talking about extremely complex things, and if they don't have a great brain, a great power of the brain, they're not going to be very good at what they do and bad things will happen."

CNN political commentator Bakari Sellers apologized on Wednesday night after deleting a tweet that placed blame on President Donald Trump for the deadly midair crash over Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., claiming he "f***ed up" by citing the president's federal hiring freeze as a potential reason for the horrific accident.
Sellers' initial post sparked backlash among Trump supporters and right-wing commentators, who called the former Democratic lawmaker "despicable" and a "broken human being" for tying the tragedy to Trump's executive actions.
Officials said on Thursday that they do not expect any survivors after an American Airlines passenger plane making its landing approach collided with a Black Hawk helicopter that was on a training mission over the D.C. airport. The flight was arriving from Wichita, Kansas, and carried 64 passengers and crew, including several members of the U.S. Figure Skating team. The Army helicopter had three soldiers aboard.

In his first visit to the White House briefing room since returning to the presidency last week, Trump initially offered a moment of silence for the victims and praised the efforts of first responders.

"That was not so prior to getting there ... and then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever before. I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first, and they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen because this was the lowest level.
