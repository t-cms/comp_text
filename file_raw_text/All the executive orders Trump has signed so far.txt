Critics say it changes the traditional understanding of religious liberty, with Americans United for Separation of Church and State saying in a statement that Trump’s taskforce would “misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination and the subversion of our civil rights laws”.

                     The order:  Trump signed three executive orders on 27 January that would reshape the military: removing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, eliminating “gender radicalism” from the military, and reinstating soldiers who were expelled for refusing Covid-19 vaccines.
                     What Trump said:  “To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It’s going to be gone,” Trump said in Florida, . 
                     What                     to know: Trump’s order does not yet ban transgender soldiers from the military, but directs the Pentagon to create a policy for trans members of the military.

                     The order:  Trump signed an executive order on 27 January that would begin the process of creating a “next-generation” missile defense shield, which the administration is referring to as the American Iron Dome.
                     What Trump said: “ The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield,” the   said.
                     What                     to know:  Creating a short-range missile defense system akin to Israel’s Iron Dome would take years to build. The order calls for a plan from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, within 60 days.

                     The order: Trump ordered a review of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), the disaster response agency, and suggested there is “political bias” in the agency. Trump previously criticized the agency’s response to Hurricane Helene.
                     What Trump said:  “Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, Fema has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,” the   stated.
                     What it means:  A review council – which includes the secretaries of defense and homeland security, Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem – will report to Trump within 180 days.

                     The order:  Trump ordered the release of thousands of classified documents on the assassinations of John F Kennedy, Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.
                     What Trump said:  “The federal government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events. Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,” the   said.
                     What it means:  Trump made this promise during the election campaign and made a similar pledge in his first term, but ultimately heeded appeals from the CIA and FBI to withhold some documents.

                     The order:  During his first week in office, Trump signed an   calling for a review of all Biden policies on AI, to remove policies that “act as barriers to American AI innovation”. A   called for a working group to start work on crypto regulations.

                     The order:  On his first day in office, Trump targeted automatic citizenship for US-born children of both undocumented people and some legal immigrants.
                     What Trump said:  The order specifies that it would limit birthright citizenship if a person’s “mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth”, or “when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary”.
                     What it means: Birthright citizenship, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on US soil, is protected by the 14th amendment and any attempt to revoke it will bring immediate legal challenges. The order was   on 23 January, with the judge calling it “blatantly unconstitutional”.

                     The order: Trump signed an order suspending the country’s refugee resettlement program starting on 27 January. Refugees maybe only be admitted on a case-by-case basis so long as their entry is in the “national interest”.
                     What Trump said: The order   “record levels of migration” to the US and said the country did not have the ability to “absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees”.
                     What it means:  Advocates say the move put lives in danger and has left families devastated. Thousands of refugees now stranded around the globe.

                     The order:                        signed an order to have the US exit the World Health Organization (WHO).
                     What Trump said: “World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen any more,” Trump said at the signing. He accused the WHO of mishandling the Covid-19 pandemic and other international health crises.
                     What it means:  The US will leave the WHO in 12 months’ time and stop all financial contributions to its work. The US is the biggest financial backer to the United Nations health agency.

                     The order:  Trump ordered two name changes: the   and Alaska’s Mount Denali.
                     What Trump said:  “President Trump is bringing common sense to government and renewing the pillars of American Civilization,” the executive order said in part.
                     What it means:  Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the “Gulf of America” and will rechristen Alaska’s Mount Denali as Mount McKinley.
It will have no bearing on what names are used internationally.

                     The order:  Trump revoked a non-binding executive order signed by Joe Biden aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.
                     What Trump said:  “The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity,” Trump said.
                     What it means:  Part of an effort to repeal Biden’s environmental protections, Trump has also promised to roll back auto pollution standards finalized by Biden’s administration last spring.

                     The order:  Trump’s executive order reclassified thousands of federal employees as political hires, making it much easier for them to be fired.
                     What Trump said:  Aides to the president have long heralded mass government firings as part of an attack on the so-called “administrative” or “deep” state.
                     What it means: Trump in effect reinstates “Schedule F”, an executive order he signed in the last year of his first term, seeking to reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers. (Biden rescinded the order.)
Key aides to Trump have called for mass government firings.   made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump’s second term. The rightwing playbook called for civil servants deemed politically unreliable to be fired and replaced by conservatives.

                     The order:  Trump declared a national energy emergency as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to “unleash” already booming US energy production that included also rolling back restrictions in drilling in Alaska and undoing a pause on gas exports.
                     What Trump said:  The order means “you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem and we do have that kind of emergency,” Trump said. The order also says it is US policy for the country to “fully avail itself of Alaska’s vast lands and resources”.
                     What it means:  The declaration would allow his administration to fast-track permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure. It is likely that the order, part of a broader effort to roll back climate policy, will face legal challenges.

                     The order: Trump signed an order to remove “   ” from federal government communication, policies and forms. The order makes it official policy that there are “only two genders, male and female”.
                     What Trump said: “Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination,” the order states.
                     What it means:  The order reverses a Biden-era executive action on the acceptance of gender identity.

                     The order:  Trump   temporarily delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok for at least 75 days.
                     What Trump said:  “I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn’t have originally,” Trump said at the White House, as he signed executive orders, according to the .  
                     What it means:  Trump ordered his attorney general to not enforce the law requiring TikTok’s sale. Trump says the pause allows for time to chart an “appropriate course forward” to protect national security and not abruptly shut down the popular app. In his first term, Trump favored a TikTok ban, but has since changed his position due to factors including his own popularity on the app.

                     The order:  Trump ordered   to be rescinded, including at least a dozen measures supporting racial equity and combating discrimination against gay and transgender people.
                     What Trump said: “I’ll revoke nearly 80 destructive and radical executive actions of the previous administration,” Trump told a crowd in Washington after his inaugural speech. He also said he would end policy “trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life” and push for a “color blind and merit-based” society.
                     What it means:  The orders signal a reversal of Biden-era policy that prioritized implementing diversity measures across the federal government. Trump repealed orders signed by Biden advancing racial equity for underserved communities and the aforementioned order combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.

                     The order:  Trump signed an order at the White House declaring an   along with several other immigration-related policies.
                     What Trump said:  “All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,” Trump said in his inauguration speech.
                     What it means:  The executive action paves the way to send US troops to the southern border and makes good on campaign promises to implement hardline immigration policies. There are limited details about how the administration plans to execute its sprawling set of immigration actions that were all but certain to face legal and logistical challenges.
Immigrant communities across the country are bracing for Trump’s promise to carry out the “largest deportation program in American history”, beginning as early as Tuesday morning.

                                        Issuing pardons for January 6 defendants                                      
                     The order:  Trump issued pardons for   on the Capitol. He will direct the Department of Justice to dismiss cases currently in progress.
                     What Trump said:  “I’m going to be signing on the J6 hostages, pardons, to get them out,” Trump said during his rally speech. “We’ll be signing pardons for a lot of people, a lot of people.” Trump said he has pardoned about 1,500 defendants charged in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and issued six commutations.
                     What it means:  Trump made his pledge to issue pardons for those with convictions related to the January 6 Capitol attack a core part of his re-election campaign. On the campaign trail, Trump often featured the national anthem sung by prisoners in a Washington DC jail. There are more than 1,500 people federally charged with associated charges.
With Trump back in the White House, justice department investigations into January 6 crimes are expected to cease.

                                        Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement                                      
                     The order:  Trump issued an executive action  , along with a letter informing the United Nations of the decision.
                     What Trump said:  “I am immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord rip-off” Trump said during a rally at the Capital One Arena. In his inaugural speech, Trump said he would use executive action to “end the Green New Deal”.
                     What it means: In 2017, Trump exited the Paris agreement. Upon taking office in 2021, Biden rejoined. Monday’s order makes good on a Trump election promise to withdraw from the 2015 global treaty seeking to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.
Exiting the Paris agreement is part of Trump’s broader efforts to roll back climate protections and policy. Trump has described Biden’s efforts to grow the US’s clean energy sector as “the green new scam”.
