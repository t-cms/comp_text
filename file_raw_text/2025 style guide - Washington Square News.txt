Each year brings new and unexpected fashion trends, and 2025 is no different. Whether you opt for more playful patterns like polka dots or love the sophistication of a kitten heel, embrace your individual style this year. Choose pieces that are unapologetically you - and if you're not sure where to start, here is a curated list of the fashion trends you are guaranteed to see, from walking throughout SoHo to people-watching in Bobst Library.
The vibe: Boho chic 
The 2010s are back, and with that comes the return of boho chic. Isabel Marant is the blueprint, elegance and free spirit combining elegance and free spirit in the style. Whether it's a fringe bag, suede boots or a flowy top, you are sure to turn heads while embracing your inner flower child. This spring and summer, it's all about embellishments, billowing silhouettes and statement belts. Now, you don't need to wait for Coachella to bring out your desert-inspired outfits. 
The print: Polka dots 
You're sure to be spotted every time you wear this year's hottest print: polka dots. Let your inner child loose, and bring this print into your wardrobe for a playful twist. Bold and timeless, polka dot tops, dresses, shoes and scarves work with any and every style. No matter what size dots, this new trend is sure to spice up your everyday look. 
The silhouette: Asymmetry
2025 is the year to celebrate imperfection. Invest in an asymmetrical look to add a dynamic touch to your wardrobe. Embrace the fresh silhouette of these imbalanced pieces with a subtle drop-shoulder top, graphic tee, fall sweater or summer dress. Your clothes should reflect your authentic self, and the reality is that no one is perfect. So, be honest with yourself this year and embrace the imperfections with unexpected cuts and jagged hems. Balanced looks are boring, anyway.
The aesthetic: Fisherman fab 
The younger sister of the coastal grandmother, Pinterest claimed the fisherman aesthetic to be the new style inspiration for this upcoming season. A more youthful and laid-back version of last year's coastal trends, the fisherman aesthetic relies heavily on more natural textures and tones. You can embrace the nautical vibe and go for a boatneck striped top, or if it's cold, go for a Fair Isle-inspired or chunky knit sweater. Finish off your look with fisherman sandals, on-theme accessories and a woven bag. If you are feeling fancy, throw in the famous Staud beaded sardines bag. 
The jewelry: Bangles  
Your outfit shouldn't just be seen - it should be heard. Let everyone know you're coming from all the way down the street with these bold bracelets. These statement pieces elevate any look, drawing in both the eyes and ears. Bangles come in all shapes and sizes, whether it be tortoiseshell, metal, gold, silver, colorful, skinny or wide.
The shoes: Kitten heels and tabis 
Strut into 2025 with these hot takes on classic footwear. Though harder to walk in than a chunky heel, a kitten heel adds an element of sophistication to your fit. With an array of colors and patterns available, you are sure to find the perfect heel for a night out or a short walk through the city. From streetwear-inspired heels to the classics, kitten heels work for every occasion. For the more controversial trend, look toward tabi boots and flats. Maison Margiela famously adapted these Japanese-style work shoes into a streetwear sensation, Microtrend or not, kitten heels and tabis are here to stay in 2025 - just try not to trip in your new style while roaming the streets.
