The following information was released by the Illinois Republican Party:
It's been one week of President Trump's America First agenda and a lot of great policies that improve the lives of Illinois residents went into effect. See for yourself what President Trump did in week one:
Declared a national emergency at our southern border
Ended catch-and-release and reinstated the Remain in Mexico policy
Realigned foreign aid to better align with American interests
Returned to America First and Peace through Strength policies
Directed agencies to implement policies that lower the cost of living
Revoked the electric vehicle mandate
Ended DEI mandates across government
Rescinded 78 Biden-era executive actions
Bottom Line:It's been just over one week with President Trump back in office and America and Illinois are trending in the right direction. Over the next four years, President Trump will continue to work for the American people to secure our border, fix our economy and Make America Great Again!
