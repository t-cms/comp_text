Highlight: The US arm of the accounting giant has bowed to pressure from President Donald Trump and “sunset” its diversity goals
Body


The US arm of KPMG has removed reports on its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from its website after similar programmes were criticised by President Trump.
The accounting and consulting firm has withdrawn years of annual “transparency reports” from its website that detailed the representation of women and minorities across the organisation. Similar reports produced for KPMG’s UK business remain available to view online.
The move, first reported by The Financial Times, comes after Deloitte, a rival accounting firm, told its US employees this month that it would “sunset” its diversity goals, an annual diversity, equity and inclusion report and the company’s 
.
The pullback from so-called DEI has spread across corporate America. Google has removed Black, LGBTQ+ and women’s holidays from its digital calendars, while 
, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has scrapped DEI programmes because of a “shifting legal and policy landscape”.
Paul Knopp, KPMG’s US chief executive, told employees that the firm will close its “Accelerate 2025” programme that included a target for half of its partners and managing directors to be from under-represented groups by this year.
In a memo, he said: “The legal landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts has been shifting, via executive orders and in the courts.”
He added: “We will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards and fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including adherence to the executive orders affecting us as a federal contractor.” 
Trump has promised to terminate DEI policies in the federal government and has ended the use of DEI in federal hiring and contracting.
He has criticised corporate DEI initiatives, ordering government agencies to draw up lists of “the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners” in different sectors and propose “up to nine potential civil compliance investigations” of public companies and other organisations.
