LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": ... on social media. We continue to pray for all of the families and of the victims of this horrific crash. It hits close to home here in Washington and across this country.
Thank you for watching. Remember it is America now and forever.
Jesse Watters, he takes it from here.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
REPORTER: How you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash?
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Because I have commonsense, and unfortunately, a lot of people don't.
WATTERS: A Black Hawk helicopter smashes into an American Airlines jet. No survivors. What's going on?
TRUMP: This is a tragedy that should not have happened.
KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR NOMINEE: The best attacks on me are going to be false accusations and grotesque mischaracterizations. The only thing this body is doing is defeating the credibility of the men and women at the FBI.
WATTERS: Kash was money at today's hearing.
PATEL: If you're not taking off some people, you're not doing your job right.
JON FAVREAU, POD SAVE AMERICA PODCAST HOST: I feel like sometimes giving messaging advice to Democrats is like giving (bleep) kids matches.
WATTERS: Even the Democrats don't like the Democrats.
FAVREAU: Come on, make it (bleep) believable, guys.
WATTERS: Plus --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Honestly, the only ones that should be deported are the White people, because no White people actually belong in this country.
WATTERS: Fox News Alert: We have new breaking details in the tragic helicopter crash over the Potomac. We're getting reports of air traffic control staffing issues at Reagan National Airport at the time of the collision that killed 67 people, including kids.
Mark Meredith is in Potomac Park with more -- Mark.
MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Jesse, good evening to you.
We learned moments ago that debris removal is going to begin tomorrow, that DC Fire and EMS will have their crews out tonight, pretty much as security just to make sure that the wreckage remains where it is, but then tomorrow, they will begin the process of moving it as they continue with this recovery operation.
American Airlines has its CEO in town, and you can imagine there are so many different federal agencies that are just beginning to come through, trying to piece together exactly what happened.
It was almost 24 hours ago, Jesse, when this whole incident began, where we could see from cameras after the Black Hawk helicopter collided with the American Airlines regional jet, the CRJ 700 with 64 passengers -- I'm sorry, 64 people on board, including four crew members.
As we've been looking to see exactly what happened, the NTSB has been saying they weren't going to rush to judgment. Now, this is going to take some time, but President Trump strongly suggests he believed that the military helicopter may have been flying too low.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The helicopter should have been a thousand feet or 500 feet above it, or something below it. The plane was at three to four hundred feet, or the plane should have been stopped, because the helicopter could have stopped, the plane can't be stopped.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MEREDITH: A preliminary report by the NTSB is expected to take at least a month. There are reports that staffing at the Reagan Airport tower may not have been what was needed, but officials stress it is simply too early at this point to determine that. It is something they're going to look at, and obviously they'll have the records of who was in the tower at that time.
But it also appears, when we heard from federal investigators, that nobody had any time on board the regional jet to react.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TODD INMAN, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY BOARD MEMBER: Right now, we're going through the debris fields. Nothing we've seen would indicate that maybe slides or shoots were deployed. It was a very quick, rapid impact, but we've seen nothing in that regard so far from the evidence we have, that we still need to verify all of that information.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MEREDITH: And members of Congress are demanding more answers from federal investigators, as they want to know, because, of course, so many of them fly in and out of this airport.
Jesse, I've been out here almost 24 hours myself, and it is a short difference in terms of we've seen far fewer aircraft, including the helicopters that would normally be patrolling the skies of DC. They just haven't been out there.
They did resume air traffic around 11 this morning. We've seen more and more jets come back in, Jesse, but it's nothing like what it would normally be out here. You've been to this airport, you can imagine how busy it is going to be.
We've been learning a lot more about the victims in this case, but no full passenger manifest, and it's likely we'll learn more details about exactly who was on board tomorrow -- Jesse.
WATTERS: Mark, thank you so much.
One witness described it as a big ball of fire and wreckage just falling down towards the river. Here's what it sounded like in the tower.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
DISPATCH: Crash, crash, crash. This is Alert Three. Crash, crash, crash. This is Alert Three.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where is the Alert Three?
DISPATCH: It is off the -- approaching the runway three-three. Approaching the runway of three-three. Helicopter crash.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
WATTERS: This is the deadliest air disaster in America since 9/11. No one is blaming the American Airlines' pilots. Planes can't get out of the way as easy as choppers. The Black Hawk pilots were pretty experienced. The male pilot had a thousand hours under his belt. The female pilot had 500. So what happened?
Tonight, we're learning that the air traffic control tower at Reagan National was understaffed. "The New York Times" breaking the story that one controller was doing the job of two. "The controller, who is handling helicopters, was also instructing planes that were landing and departing from its runways. That's not normal." That means you're using two frequencies, and the plane pilots can't hear the helicopter pilots.
Reagan National has had staffing shortages for a while. They're supposed to have 30 air traffic controllers in the tower, they only had 19. This is the busiest runway in America, and they're down 11 guys.
In fact, "The Washington Post" is reporting that just Tuesday, another jet trying to land aborted and had to make a second approach after a helicopter appeared on its flight path.
The president briefed the nation this morning and said DEI could be a factor.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office, and here's one, the FAA's diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing.
Brilliant people have to be in those positions, and their lives are actually shortened, very substantially shortened because of the stress, where you have many, many planes coming into one target, and you need a very special talent and a very special genius to be able to do it.
Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a real winner, that guy is a real winner. Do you know how badly everything's run since he's run the Department of Transportation? He's a disaster.
He was a disaster as a mayor. He ran his city into the ground, and he's a disaster now. He's just got a good line of bullshit.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Anytime you mention DEI, the press goes crazy because that's their baby.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: We don't even yet know the names of the 67 people who were killed and you are blaming Democrats and DEI policies and air traffic control. Don't you think you're getting ahead of the investigation right now?
TRUMP: No, I don't think so at all. I don't think -- what are the names of the people? You mean the names of the people that are on the plane? You think that's going to make a difference?
COLLINS: Does it comfort their families the way you're blaming DEI policies?
TRUMP: They are a group of people that have lost their lives. If you want a list of the names, we can give you that. We'll be giving that very soon, in coordination with American Airlines. We're in coordination very strongly, obviously, with the military. But I think that's not a very smart question. I'm surprised coming from you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And the DEI defenders didn't stop.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash?
TRUMP: Because I have commonsense, okay? And unfortunately, a lot of people don't.
We want brilliant people doing this. This is a major chess game at the highest level. When you have 60 planes coming in during a short period of time, and they're all coming in different directions, and you're dealing with very high level computer -- computer work and very complex computers, and one of the other things I will tell you is that the systems that were built, I was going to rebuild the entire system, and then we had an election that didn't turn out the way it should have.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now we don't know what factor DEI played here. Could have been a mechanical issue, could have been medical. They've just recovered one of the black boxes, and this investigation is going to tell us the truth.
But when DEI is in place, which it was at the FAA, standards get lowered, staffing is affected. And when there's a disaster like this, it makes everyone naturally suspicious.
Late in the Obama-Biden administration, a thousand well-qualified air traffic control applicants were rejected for not being diverse enough. That caused staffing shortages, and the Biden administration was sued for discriminating against qualified White applicants.
The COVID shutdowns didn't help staffing either. They stopped training controllers for two years. How are air traffic controllers not essential workers? I have no idea.
And this DEI thing isn't just a race thing. Biden instituted DEI quotas at the FAA in order to recruit workers who were deaf, vision impaired, missing limbs, completely paralyzed, epileptic, people who were severely intellectually disabled, psychiatrically disabled and dwarfs. This was Biden's FAA just two years ago.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRADLEY MIMS, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR AT FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION: We need a diverse group of air traffic controllers to bring distinct perspectives to handle the ever changing aerospace landscape.
I'm calling on students and alumni from HBCUs, Hispanic serving institutions and tribal colleges to apply now to become air traffic controllers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: PRIMETIME also found this little slide show from the Biden FAA titled "Rethinking Diversity," and it says, "Diversity plus inclusion equals better performance." That true? A major problem was that the FAA couldn't even fill their own DEI quotas.
According to lawsuits, they discriminated against qualified candidates to hire diverse candidates, but they weren't able to hire enough diverse candidates.
Air traffic control towers are short staffed across the country. The agency has a thousand fewer certified controllers today than it did a decade ago. Only one percent of air traffic facilities met their staffing targets last year, one percent. Why is the FAA the only agency in the federal government short staffed? Every other agency has the opposite problem. They have too much personnel.
Only at the FAA, they can't find enough people. Is that because you can't work remotely to be an air traffic controller? And it's not about money, Biden and Trump spent the exact same amount on the FAA. This is about mismanagement, and that's the president's point.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: Are you saying race or gender played a role in this tragedy?
TRUMP: I don't know -- incompetence might have played a role. We'll let you know that. But we want the most competent people. We don't care what race they are. We want the most competent people, especially in those positions.
And you're talking about extremely complex things, and if they don't have a great brain, a great power of the brain, they're not going to be very good at what they do, and bad things will happen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: This is about competence and it starts at the top. In less than 24 hours, the president came out, held an open-ended press conference with the Secretaries of Transportation and Defense and his VP, and then took questions in the Oval and signed a presidential memo to get to the bottom of things.
As a reminder, this is who Joe Biden nominated to run the FAA.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. TED BUDD (R-NC): What airspace requires an ADSB transponder? Quickly, please.
PHILLIP WASHINGTON, FORMER PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S NOMINEE TO HEAD THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION: Thank you for the question, Senator. I am not sure I can answer that question right now.
BUDD: So what are the six types of special use airspace that protect this National Security that appear on FAA charts? Quickly, please.
WASHINGTON: Sorry, Senator, I cannot answer that question.
BUDD: So what are the operational limitations of a pilot flying under basic med?
WASHINGTON: Well, thank you for the question, Senator. I'm not a pilot, so --
BUDD: Can you tell me what the minimum separation distance is for landing and departing airliners during the daytime, Mr. Washington?
WASHINGTON: I don't want to guess on that.
BUDD: Do you know the difference between those two -- Part 44-809, and Part 107? Do you know the difference there?
WASHINGTON: No, I cannot.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That guy had to withdraw his nomination because he was so unqualified.
We've had mechanical issues with Boeing jets. Tulsi Gabbard was put on a TSA watchlist. We've had near misses over and over again. These things should never happen in the United States of America, and a crash like this should never happen again.
Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of these victims. We are so sorry for your loss. This is just such a senseless tragedy. What a sad day for this country.
Former Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, Amber Smith joins me now.
Amber, you flew helicopters, and you listen to air traffic controllers when you land and take off. Here's the air traffic controller moments before the crash when he asks the chopper pilot if they can see the plane. Listen.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
ATC: PAT 25. Do you have the CRJ in sight? PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.
HELICOPTER PILOT: PAT 2-5 has aircraft in sight, request visual separation.
ATC: Separation.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now, as a former chopper pilot, how do you think that communication was between the helicopter and air traffic control?
AMBER SMITH, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: It was a failure of communication. I said this from the very beginning.
I was an Army helicopter pilot for almost eight years. I've got well over 1,500 hours. That communication between ATC and the helicopter flight crew was unfortunately -- ended up being deadly.
It is clear that the helicopter crew claims that they had visual on the incorrect aircraft. But if you go a little bit deeper, there was zero context to what ATC said. They did not say, do you have the air traffic at your 11 o'clock that's about to cross in front of your flight path? Not once, and so that may work having a singular -- do you see the traffic in front of you in the middle of the desert in Arizona, where there's no other traffic.
In a place like the National Capital Region, where the traffic is intense, where there's lights everywhere, that can be distracting, and as well, you know, seen as a different aircrafts, you cannot be giving those types of ATC calls, which are clearly confusing and sadly resulted in this absolutely deadly crash because of this miscommunication that we've seen.
WATTERS: All right, so you believe the air traffic controllers were poor communicators, and those communications were inefficient and inadequate for what was happening in the sky.
In your experience and your understanding of these air traffic controllers, there's under staffing, there's a DEI problem there. Do you think that could have been a factor?
SMITH: I do and where is the standard? When the reports came out that the tower was likely understaffed by a third, if not more, what is the standard? What percentage are they allowed to go down to, to cease operations until they are able to be a functioning tower? Because clearly they weren't.
This is a high stress operation. The stakes are incredibly high, and who, in a leadership decision decided that they were able to operate a tower at that level of manning? It's mismanagement, the DEI aspect needs to get looked into it, because it focuses on people's feelings, rather than people's lives.
Merit is what allows people to be put in these positions, to be the best person for the job, just as we saw in your opening where you talked about DEI. Calling in these people to make other people feel better at the risk of other people's lives.
When people say DEI is deadly, it is not because it's some catchy phrase. It is because the reality of what happens when you change the standards, you lower the standards to put people in these positions in order for them to get the job in otherwise would never be able to get these jobs.
WATTERS: All right, Amber, thank you so much for your insight and analysis. And again, we're waiting on this black box to be cracked open and analyzed, and we'll get a full investigation, hopefully sooner than later.
Thank you so much.
SMITH: Thank you.
WATTERS: Kash Patel dunking on Democrats.
Plus Johnny --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Could you be hired based on your race or the work you could do?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The work you could do, man? There is no question about it. (Bleep). If I don't know how to build a Porsche, I should get hired to build a Porsche.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Today, the Trump team took over Capitol Hill. Kash Patel, RFK, Jr., and Tulsi Gabbard had confirmation hearings. RFK and Bernie got into it again, but this time, it wasn't about onesies.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. US HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: And by the way, Bernie, you know, the problem of corruption is not just in the federal agencies, it is in Congress too. Almost all the members of this panel are accepting, including yourself, are accepting millions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry.
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Oh, no. No, no, no.
KENNEDY: Protecting their interests.
SANDERS: I got millions and millions of contributions. They did not come from the executives. Not one nickel of PAC money from the pharmaceutical industry. They came from workers.
KENNEDY: In 2020 -- in 2020, you were the single largest receiver of pharmaceutical money.
SANDERS: Because I had more contributions --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Tulsi is up to be Trump's Director of National Intelligence, and she came out swinging.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TULSI GABBARD, NOMINEE FOR DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Those who oppose my nomination imply that I am loyal to something or someone other than God, my own conscience, and the Constitution of the United States, accusing me of being Trump's puppet, Putin's puppet, Assad's puppet, a guru's puppet, Modi's puppet, not recognizing the absurdity of simultaneously being the puppet of five different puppet masters.
The same tactic was used against President Trump and failed. The American people elected President Trump with a decisive victory and mandate for change.
The fact is, what truly unsettles my political opponents is I refuse to be their puppet.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And Kash Patel put on a master class during his hearing to become America's new FBI director. Kash is a former DOJ prosecutor and chief-of- staff at The Pentagon who exposed Crossfire Hurricane and the Hunter Biden laptop cover up.
The Intelligence Agencies actually leaked his personal records as payback.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PATEL: Having been the victim of government overreach and a weaponized system of justice and law enforcement, I know what it feels like to have the full weight of the United States government barreling down on you.
I will make sure that no American is subjected to death threats like I was, and subjected to moving their residences like I was, because of government overreach, because of leaks of information about my personal status.
If confirmed as FBI Director, Mr. Chairman, you have my commitment that no one in this country will feel that pain.
(End VT)
WATTERS: Kash has a tough job ahead of him. He has to expose the corruption deep within the government while at the same time fighting crime. We may even get to know the truth about Jan 6th.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): While you were chief-of-staff at DoD, how many times did DoD approach Capitol Police and ask if they needed National Guard assistance?
PATEL: I believe those letters are well-documented, numerous instances, and numerous of those instances, they were -- those requests were shut down.
CRUZ: Am I correct that the Capitol Sergeant-at-Arms said assistance was unnecessary?
PATEL: That's correct, Senator.
CRUZ: Who did the Sergeant-at-Arms report to?
PATEL: The Speaker of the House.
CRUZ: That would have been Nancy Pelosi at the time, is that correct?
PATEL: Yes, Senator.
CRUZ: And would that also be Chuck Schumer, then the Senate Majority Leader?
PATEL: The Sergeant-at-Arms, yes, Senator.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The Democrats fear Kash, and I think you know why.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): On Joe Pags podcast, he asked you, the Capitol Police in that fake January 6 committee, they didn't tell the truth, did they? Patel: No, not just them, many others, and lying under oath is a federal offense, and they should be investigated for it.
Do you believe that about the police officers?
PATEL: That's a general statement and a mischaracterization of what I said. I encourage you to read the rest of the interview. This is why snippets of information are often misleading and detrimental to this committee's advice and consent process.
KLOBUCHAR: If you consent, I would love to have five hours of questions, and then I could read the whole transcript.
PATEL: You've got two minutes.
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Wow.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The entire hearing was Republican senators asking Kash about crime, justice, and accountability, and the Democrats just cherry picking things he said on podcasts.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): You said FBI agents were responsible for the violence on January 6th, and I quote you here, "beyond a reasonable doubt," is that what you said?
PATEL: That's completely incorrect, and I appreciate the opportunity to address that.
WHITEHOUSE: I'll give you an opportunity in writing, but this is my time now.
PATEL: Have at it.
SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): Do you think that America is safer because the 1,600 people have been given an opportunity to come out of serving their sentences and live in our communities again?
PATEL: Senator, I have not looked at all 1,600 individual cases. I have always advocated for imprisoning those that cause harm to our law enforcement and civilian communities.
I also believe America is not safer because President Biden's commutation of a man who murdered two FBI agents.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Kash Patel has the endorsements of all the major sheriffs and police organizations, but he's hated by guys like Adam Schiff.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): You've made a lot of people mad, haven't you, Mister? Mr. Patel?
PATEL: It seems so, Senator.
KENNEDY: You think maybe you've made the right people mad?
PATEL: As my FBI agents, the brick agents told me when I was running cases with them across this country and on the world, if you're taking off some people, you're not doing your job right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Patel promised he wasn't out for revenge, doesn't have an enemy's list, and that he disagreed with Trump's commutations of Jan 6 defendants who assaulted cops. Removing politics from the Bureau and fighting crime will be the man's mission.
Senator Josh Hawley is on the Judiciary Committee, and he joins me now.
We're going to get a lot of disclosure from Kash Patel, especially on January 6th. What will that look like, Senator?
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Well, number one, it'll look like a change, Jesse, because what we've gotten for the last four years is nothing but stonewalling, it is nothing but lies frankly from the FBI, the FBI director when he's come before Congress and the world deserves to know.
The American people deserve to know exactly what the FBI's role was in January 6th. They also deserve to know what the FBI has been doing with its time. While they've been pursuing January 6th defendants, they haven't been putting drug kingpins behind bars, they haven't been going after child traffickers. They haven't been going after the drug cartels.
It's time to get the FBI focused, Jesse on, you know, I don't know criminals again, and actually putting violent criminals behind bars, I think Kash will do that.
WATTERS: The Democrats look terrified, not really equipped to handle a guy like Kash. Are we going to learn things about Butler? Are we going to learn things about the Palm Beach attempt? What else are we going to find out here?
HAWLEY: You know something that he told me, Jesse, he pledged to me that he would open the books on what you just said. He would open the books on the assassination attempts. He would open the books on the FBI's lying to the FISA court, for example, when they went and lied to get wiretaps on President Trump the first time around. He would open the books on all of their corruption.
So you better believe the Democrats are worried because they've been cheering this on for the last four years. They talk about enemies lists and political persecution. The FBI has been their personal play thing, at least the FBI headquarters has been for the last four years, and they're scared to death that Patel will end it.
They're not worried that he will actually persecute political opponents, they're worried he's going to stop the FBI doing that, because that's what they've been doing the last four years.
WATTERS: So it looks like he'll be confirmed.
Tell me about Tulsi and RFK, Jr. What are your colleagues on the Republican side thinking here?
HAWLEY: Well, I hope that they're listening carefully to what both nominees said. I got to talk to RFK today under oath at the hearing. I thought he did spectacularly. He was honest, he was direct, he was forthright.
As for Tulsi Gabbard, you know, here's her real sin, Jesse, in the eyes of so many of the Washington establishment of both parties, her sin is she challenged the surveillance state. She told the truth about the government spying on Americans, about the abuses of FISA. She went out there and was honest about it, and for that, she is getting absolutely roasted and persecuted. That's the real issue here.
And I hope that Republicans will look at both of these individuals and say, these are truth tellers. These are people who are going to disrupt the status quo, and they're going to get their agencies, the government, back to serving the American people and telling us the truth. Wouldn't that be a refreshing change?
WATTERS: Do your Republican colleagues understand what's going to happen if they vote down Tulsi?
HAWLEY: You know, I don't know, and I have to tell you, I'm worried by what I hear from some of my Republican colleagues. I'm worried that her nomination may be in jeopardy, and I'm just worried about what that will mean.
It will mean that the reforms that we desperately need in the Intelligence space, let's not just pretend everything is fine and dandy and hunky dory in the Intelligence community, it is not.
Besides the fact that they have missed major, major issues, I mean, and besides the fact they misled us on COVID, for example, for so long, we need reform to stop the abuse of things like FISA Section 702, stop spying on Americans. I hope Tulsa gets confirmed, because we need that kind of reform.
WATTERS: Now I'm worried that you're worried, Senator, and that's not a good thing.
Tell me about a conversation you had today with the people investigating this horrific plane chopper crash. What do we know?
HAWLEY: Well, the thing that really struck me, I talked to the head of the NTSB today and got the latest on their investigation as it begins to unfold here. Here's what really struck me, Jesse, is that helicopters -- helicopter flight patterns overlay commercial flight patterns in the Reagan National Airport area.
What's that mean? It means military helicopters are frequently -- I was told -- in the same airspace as commercial jetliners, including at 9:00 PM at night, as happened last night.
I think we've got to ask ourselves, is that really a good idea? I mean to we really want overlapping flight patterns? Do we really want all of that crowded airspace jammed in there like that?
I think we've got to ask ourselves, how are we best keeping our civilians safe as they come in on these planes? A lot to learn. The NTSB is just starting their investigation, but we need answers, Jesse and I -- this is - - I want to make clear to everybody in authority here, the American public deserves to know exactly what happened, and we deserve to know it sooner, rather than later.
WATTERS: We sure do. Senator Hawley, Missouri, thank you so much. Good to talk to you.
HAWLEY: Thank you.
WATTERS: Well, Trump just started two trade wars. Charlie Kirk is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Trump warned them, and they didn't listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: So we'll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons. Number one, is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. And number three are the massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits. And I'll be putting the tariff of 25 percent on Canada, and separately, 25 percent on Mexico.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The tariffs go into effect Saturday, so buy your maple syrup and Corona now. The administration is moving fast. You either get out of the way or get run over.
Federal employees who don't come back to the office are getting the pink slip. Legacy media does not like that one bit.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL STRAHAN, ABC NEWS, "GOOD MORNING AMERICA": Is there any concern that we risk losing people with years of experience like doctors and, let's say, scientists?
KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, most doctors who work in actual hospitals and medical institutions have to show up to the office.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump is offering a generous severance package for anyone who doesn't want to commute. But some bureaucrats want to fight, fight, fight.
Some of the Labor Department said, "I would rather be fired for resisting and making their lives hell." Even employees who are planning on quitting are staying just to resist. "I was looking for any way to get out of this fresh hell, but now I am fired up to make these goons as frustrated as possible. Return to office be damned."
Trump's not just firing people, he's hiring them. The president talks so much more than Biden that the White House is adding more stenographers. Under Biden, they were bored, and now they're typing 20,000 words a day.
And he's not just talking the talk. The Republican Party has its highest approval rating of all time. Democrats are desperate for a face lift. Last night, they held an emergency meeting to conjure up a counter strategy. What did they come up with?
Eggs.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAVREAU: I feel like sometimes giving messaging advice to Democrats is like giving (bleep) kids matches, you know, it's like, you say something about like, inflation and the cost of living, and suddenly they're all out there being like, that's not going to do anything to lower the price of eggs.
It's like, come on, make it (bleep) believable, guys. It's not believable right now. No one is out there thinking that Donald Trump was going to lower the price of eggs or lower the cost of everything after a (bleep) week.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Eggs, Jan 6, DEI, deportations. Trump has Democrats playing whack- a-mole, and whatever they say about anything, no one is buying it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): My party needs to re-establish our credibility on a number of issues. We don't have the credibility that we need on issues like immigration, like DEI, dealing with racism and discrimination, like the economy.
I think we need to spend more time re-establishing our own credibility, not just bashing on what Trump does.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The Democratic Party is more unpopular than it's been in the history of the Quinnipiac poll. No one likes the Democrats, not even Democrats.
Founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk is here.
You've studied the Democratic Party, Charlie, on college campuses, in Congress. What state is it in right now?
CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: They are in the wilderness. They're in a state of confusion. In fact, President Trump is moving so fast, Democrats can't even remember all the things they're supposed to be mad about.
Wait a second, which one are we mad about today? Was it the gender mutilation executive order? Was it the affirmative action thing? All right, no, it's eggs. The fact that he's securing the southern border.
Look, they're going to try to gin up some resistance, but deep down, smart Democrats know that this is performative, and this is the brilliance of what President Trump and his team are doing right now.
It is a shock and awe strategy. You know, the Democrats right now are in the wilderness. They're trying to find their direction. They're trying to find their leader. They're trying to orient themselves out of this state of complete confusion, and President Trump is not giving them a reprieve.
Every day, they wake up to another executive order, another executive action, a master class of diplomacy that we saw with Colombia over the weekend.
And every day, even if they're trying to, you know, raise money and do more text message and e-mail campaigns to get people to go resist in the streets, boom, another executive order comes because deep down, they know that President Trump is just getting started, and this is before a robust legislative agenda that's going to come through from the House and the Senate.
So President Trump is moving so quickly that Democrats right now are not even given the opportunity to regroup or re-gather, and President Trump therefore is having full spectrum dominance over the American political landscape.
WATTERS: What about the war on the inside? These saboteurs, the dead enders, the DEI undercover agents. He's trying to root them out. Some of them are just announcing they're going to stay in the federal government and just pull pins out of hand grenades.
KIRK: I mean, look, first and foremost, insubordination will not be tolerated. These people must be very careful. There are federal laws against these sorts of things, not following orders or leaking classified information. I can tell you right now, the people that are actually making the decisions in these departments, the political appointees, are phenomenal.
Personnel is policy. The president has the best team he has ever had around him, from senior staff, from personnel, from the people actually leading these bureaucracies, and a lot of these individuals are going to reveal themselves, but I could tell you right now that the pace of which they are operating, it's not exactly a friendly pace for some of the people that were working in the Biden administration.
They were very used to opening up their laptop around 11:00 AM, maybe having a second job, coming into work maybe once a month and working every so often.
This is a different operation, a different administration, one that wants results for the American people. And let any federal worker right now be warned that if you are going to subvert the will of a president, then you're playing with legal fire right there, because it is very clear in Article II that the president of the United States is in charge of the federal bureaucracy. You don't get to call the shots, you follow orders, or you can go find a job at Salesforce.
WATTERS: We were just joking upstairs. Now there's a trade war against Mexico and Canada and any other news day, this would be top line, and this is just deep down in the show. How do you think this impact is going to play out on the economy?
KIRK: Well, look, I trust the president's negotiation ability completely. Understand that many of these companies want to actually do business here in America, and so to avoid the tariff, re-domicile your manufacturing here to America, to onshore these jobs.
Look, I think that when it comes to immigration, using the tariffs as a negotiating tactic to get Mexico to come to the table is brilliant. And I think the president using tariffs in the way he has to encourage manufacturing to come back to this country has been long overdue.
We used to fund the entire federal government with tariffs. We used to fund all of our goods and services that we had through tariffs. In fact, I love the President's idea of the External Revenue Service. Get rid of the Internal Revenue Service. Let's start actually taxing the rest of the world and we are able to do this as the world's superpower, as the incumbent economic power, because everyone wants to do business here.
It's one thing if you're Portugal, it's one thing if you're Spain, it's another thing if you're the United States of America, because people want to come here, this will result in trillions of dollars of more investment in capital coming into our country.
WATTERS: So Charlie wants to get rid of the income tax so they just pay the federal budget down with tariffs. I know why, it is because Charlie is making so much money. And you know what? I agree. Let's do it. Let's scrap it.
See you, Charlie.
WATTERS: So how was Trump's first week on the job? Johnny conducted a poll.
