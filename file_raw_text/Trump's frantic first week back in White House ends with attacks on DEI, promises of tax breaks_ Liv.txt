President 's first week in the White House has been a whirlwind of executive orders on a range of issues, pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.
The new president also visited disaster-struck areas in  and , suggesting that the  () be shut down.
Trump placed every person in the federal government working on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) on leave, and his administration issued threats to those who don't report their colleagues who attempt to hide their DEI efforts behind new titles.
The 78-year-old began his week back in the White House by pardoning roughly 1,500 people who took part in the Capitol riot, including many who resorted to violence against police officers. Among those handed pardons and commutations were Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys, and Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the militia the Oath Keepers.
Trump headed to  on Saturday after his visit to view the  wildfire damage alongside Governor Gavin Newsom. In Nevada, Trump spoke about his initiative to remove all taxes on tips.

Just six days into his second, and, theoretically final, term as president, Donald Trump once again lashed out at the free press in the wee hours of Saturday morning.
"Wow! Rachel Maddow has horrible ratings," Trump posted on his flagging Twitter clone, Truth Social, at 1:05 am. "She'll be off the air very soon. MSNBC IS CLOSE TO DEATH. CNN HAS REACHED THE BOTTOM. This is a good thing. They are the Enemy of the people!"
The ratings-obsessed Trump has long gone after the media when it has not treated him with the obsequiousness he prefers.

That's, in fact, up from the  in the aftermath of Trump's electoral victory in November.

Democratic states weigh more support for immigrants as Trump administration cracks down

David A. Lieb
As President  tightens the nation's immigration policies, lawmakers in Democratic-led states are proposing new measures that could erect legal obstacles for federal immigration officials and help immigrants lacking legal status avoid deportation.
The resistance efforts in ,  and other states are a counterpoint to the many Republican-led states advancing measures to aid Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, highlighting a national divide.
In just his first week in office, Trump's administration has halted refugee arrivals; fast-tracked deportations; sent military troops to the southern border; lifted longtime rules restricting immigration enforcement near schools, churches and hospitals; attempted to end birthright citizenship; and ordered federal prosecutors to investigate state or local officials who they believe are interfering with his crackdown on illegal immigration.

Donald Trump said he was going to do it. His foreign policy and his defence team gave due warning that they'd do it. And yet, as Marco Rubio smashed a fist into the solar plexus of an already battered Ukraine, there's still stunned surprise.
In a memo sent to embassies and agencies who rely on US funding, to a tune of $72 billion at last count, the new US secretary of state ordered a stop order on American worldwide aid funding for up to 90 days.
Excluded from this move are Israel and Egypt. They're fine.
Ukraine is a democracy that's been identified by the highest court on the planet, the International Criminal Court, as being the victim of war crimes. But aid from the US, both civilian and military, appears to have been cut overnight with the sweep of a pen.

Trump's stance on FEMA comes from Project 2025

Oliver O'Connell
With President Donald Trump promising a serious overhaul of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or completely "getting rid of it," you might wonder where this idea came from...
Here's what it says on , published by the Heritage Foundation:
The bloated DHS bureaucracy and budget, along with the wrong priorities, provide real opportunities for a conservative Administration to cut billions in spending and limit government's role in Americans' lives. These opportunities include privatizing TSA screening and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program, reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government, eliminating most of DHS's grant programs, and removing all unions in the department for national security purposes.
Project 2025 also suggests that FEMA be moved from the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of the Interior, or if combined with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in the Department of Transportation (p. 134).

According to details , President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Friday that takes the first step toward potentially reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency by creating a task force to review it and recommend changes.
The order establishes a group called the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, whose members will include the secretaries of homeland security and defense, along with private-sector subject matter experts. The task force will be directed to issue a report to Trump on how the federal disaster response agency currently operates and ultimately recommend changes-potentially reorganizing or eliminating FEMA.
Trump has expressed a desire for states to take more control of disaster responses within their borders. For instance, White House officials have highlighted Florida, which played a significant role in managing the aftermath of Hurricane Ian.
A White House official confirmed to Semafor that Trump is expected to sign the directive later today during his multi-state cross-country trip from North Carolina to California and on to Nevada.

Trump says OPEC+ can end the bloodshed in Ukraine by cutting oil prices
Saturday 25 January 2025 11:30
,
Oliver O'Connell
The president continued to make the case that reducing oil revenue is the key to finding an endgame in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.
In his first days in office, Trump has focused on the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries, arguing that it has kept the price of oil too high for much of the nearly three-year war. Oil revenue is the engine driving the Russian economy.
"One way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money. And they drop the price of oil because they have it nice and high," Trump told reporters during a visit to Western North Carolina on Friday. "And if you have it high, then that war is not going to end so easily. So, OPEC ought to get on the ball and drop the price of oil. And that war will stop right away."
Watch that moment here:
Trump: "We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil, and that will automatically stop the tragedy that's taking place in Ukraine."
