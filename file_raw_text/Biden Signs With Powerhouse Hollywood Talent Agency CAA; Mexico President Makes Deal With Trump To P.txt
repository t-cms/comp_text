SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Fox Nation. That's all the time we have left this evening. Thank you for being with us. Please set your DVR, so you never, ever, ever miss an episode of Hannity. In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Great Gutfeld is standing by to put a smile on your face. Have a great night.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit, I said sit down, sit down. Somebody grab that poor lady who passed out, Happy Tuesday, everyone. So, congratulations to Joe Biden, who signed with the Hollywood Powerhouse Agency CAA. He's already landed the lead in the reboot of The Walking Dead. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris just signed a deal to get her old job back.
Mexican President, Claudia Sheinbaum made a deal with Trump to pause tariffs and put 10,000 Mexican troops on the border, and the best part is, they all fit in one car. Oh, you laugh at that? Ilhan Omar slammed Trump for wanting to shut down the USAID agency, who she credited with getting her family to America, even more they were able to get her brother and her husband here on one ticket.
Gen Z gun control activist, David Hogg, has been elected as Vice Chair of the DNC. In the next five years, his goals are to get rid of ICE, the NRA, and his virginity. After 20 wonderful years, Chuck Todd has left NBC News. He plans to take some time to -- wow, way to ruin my joke. He plans to take some time to enjoy what's left of his hairline.
Kanye West's wife, Bianca Censori appeared in a see-through outfit at the Grammys, making viewers grateful that West isn't married to Hillary Clinton. Terrible. On Friday, anti-ICE protesters burned the American flag, the country they want to stay in, and then, waved the Mexican flag, the country they don't want to return to. It's weird. That's like cheating on your girlfriend with your wife.
GEORGE "TYRUS" MURDOCH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, Jamie, you don't nod on that one. That's not a nod.
GUTFELD: You know think about it.
TYRUS: You didn't learn that at Nod school.
GUTFELD: And finally, cattle auctions could be coming to an end at America's last big city stockyard. Now, if you want to place a bid on live cattle, you got to come to New York City. You're so mean. I wouldn't do those jokes if you didn't love them. So, Trump had quite a weekend. While the rest of us mowed lawns, watched a game or called ICE on Selena Gomez, what was he doing?
The usual, carved out millions of government waste, started cleaning out a corrupt DOJ, got Venezuela to take back their gang bangers, persuaded Panama to drop the sweetheart deal with China, got Mexico and Canada in line to fight the fentanyl trade, got 10,000 New Mexican military personnel sent to the border, plus, he ordered 17 pizzas to Stormy Daniels house under the name, still a loser.
That's -- that's quite a weekend. All I did was, rescue those college gymnasts from a makeshift dungeon, at my lake house. Wow.
TYRUS: Not a big -- not a big fan of serial killing.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TYRUS: Captain Crunch.
GUTFELD: But it begs comparison between the old and the new. Here's the new guy. (VIDEO PLAYING). Yeah. Compare that. All right, Compare that to the old. (VIDEO PLAYING). So, is this a new golden age? And I don't mean the peace Danes Joe left on the Oval Office rug. The thing is, with Trump getting so much done so fast, you got to wonder, what was the holdup. What was stopping us was the prices right on.
But, maybe, it's not just that Trump's making the moves. It's that most of us didn't know these moves were even possible. I mean, who knew America could actually get big stuff done anymore? It's like if Stephen Hawking's wife woke up one day and found the kitchen spotless.
TYRUS: Oh, come on.
GUTFELD: He would have laughed. It would have sounded weird, but he would have laughed.
TYRUS: Yeah, it's not like he was going to get up and kick your ass.
GUTFELD: I know. I mean, did any of us know that the Chinese had locked up a deal with the Panama Canal, until Trump called it out? Or that Venezuela had American hostages until Trump freed them? Or that China was shipping in billions of cheap goods under something called the de minimis loophole, which provided cover for fentanyl smuggling? I mean, what's a de minimis loophole -- loophole? I had no idea.
It sounds like a sex act from Star Wars. One thing you could say about the Trump Administration, they're terrible at keeping government secrets, and it's beautiful, because suddenly we're all learning a hell of a lot that we didn't know before. For instance, we can reduce 6,000 border crossings a day to under 600. I haven't seen numbers drop like that since Whoopi got on Ozempic. Did you know there are more suspects on the terror watch list coming from Canada than Mexico?
Did you know Canada is a major source of fentanyl entering the country? Did you know Canadian bacon is just mediocre ham? I know, I didn't, and I'm the voice of a generation. I thought the only horrible thing Canada ever gave us was Seth Rogen. Then there's Ukraine, Trump just told Zelensky that he expects our cash. Then, we get the rare earth metals.
You know, the metals essential to our iPhones, lithium batteries and little Wayne's teeth. So, that's new, hell all, Joe Biden got out of Ukraine was a fake job for his son, and the same goes for Greenland. Have you ever, really ever thought about Greenland? Trump did. Suddenly, we find out it's key to securing America's future shipping. Where the hell has all this intel been?
Was it sitting in that file near Biden's Corvette, just like the one with the addresses of all the rapists, murderers and human traffickers that ICE has suddenly been able to round up? And don't get me started with NGOs, until Trump came along, I thought an NGO was something I picked up from a stripper on spring break. Then there's USAID, it sounds like a patriotic sports drink.
Turns out, it's yet another federal agency none of us knew about, which sent $1 billion of our cash to Gaza, money that apparently went to Hamas, I guess ISIS only took Venmo. They also spent millions of DEI on places like Serbia, Peru, Guatemala, and paid for a transgender opera in Colombia. What was that called? Madam Butterfly has a (BEEP).
They helped the Taliban make heroin, which they then spent on sluttier goats. And let's not forget, they also help fund a certain Chinese lab in Wuhan, which I think cancels all the humanitarian aid USAID claim to provide. So, anyway, Trump's been in charge a few weeks, and we're suddenly getting a truth title wave, love him or hate him, there's no denying, Trump is where government secrets go to die. And you can follow all of it, but only if you could keep up with the guy. Good luck with that.
Let's welcome tonight's guests. His kids still haven't given him a four winning address; actor, writer, comedian, Jamie Lissow. There aren't many who are brighter than this very thoughtful writer; Attorney, Julian Epstein. Her maternity is taking an eternity; New York Times bestselling author and Fox News contributor, Kat Timpf. And Greenland is his ice pack; New York Times bestselling author, Fox News contributor, comedian, and former NWA World Champion, Tyrus.
Jamie, so when you hear about Trump's weekend, you must feel even more worthless than you already feel. I mean, what are your weekends? You take one of your estranged kids to McDonald's, sit in a parking lot?
JAMIE LISSOW, ACTOR, WRITER AND COMEDIAN: Yeah, me, him and the cop. I really felt productive this weekend. All I did was put my garbage at the street, and then, I watched those guys take it. I was like, I feel as good. Isn't it fun, though, to watch the left go crazy, like, oh my God, the President's doing stuff. I didn't know the President was allowed to do stuff.
I thought we just Google them every day to find out if he was still alive. Like, it's, it's fascinating to watch. He's done so many things in what's it been just over a week. Do you know when they asked Biden when he took office, do you remember they asked him what he wanted for his first executive order, and he said, cream of wheat.
GUTFELD: Is there going to be a time that we retire the Joe Biden jokes?
LISSOW: I hope so, only because that means we won't have heard from him. But until that, these haven't expired yet, Greg.
GUTFELD: Julian, welcome to this show.
JULIAN EPSTEIN, SENIOR COUNSELOR: Thank you.
GUTFELD: How do the Democrats deal with this? Because you keep hearing that they're kind of overwhelmed.
EPSTEIN: Well, first, thanks for having me on the show. Democrats deal with this the same way they've been dealing with almost everything else the last 10 years, which is a lot of contempt, a lot of disdain, and a lot of ad hominem name-calling. When you swim in a culture long enough you don't notice the culture. But this is all the Democrats stand for. They don't build anything anymore.
It used to be a party that built things. Look at what happened in Los Angeles. Look at what happened with the train system here in New York. Supposed to be done in 2009, started in 2009, still hasn't started. Democrats have lost the ability to build and all they do is sort of complain, and issue contempt citations. It's about all they do. Trump, on the other hand, this has been remarkable what he's done.
I mean, it shows that he does what he promised he would say he would do, which is very refreshing for American people, it shows an incredible business-like efficiency, and it shows strength. You know, like him or hate him, Donald Trump is a strong guy, and even a very strong guy, and a strong leader. And even when there were lots of sort of complaints from -- from places like The Wall Street Journal and conservative quarters about tariffs, he doesn't back down.
And American people like somebody that doesn't back down. So, it's quite a contrast between strength, on the one hand, showed by Trump, and contempt by the Democrats, which the American people don't like.
GUTFELD: Yeah, in fact, it's like, it's so strange that things are actually happening at this speed. Kat, do you think Donald Trump is on something?
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't actually.
GUTFELD: Yeah, I don't either.
TIMPF: Yeah, I don't --
GUTFELD: That was a trap to set you up.
TIMPF: Yeah. Thank you for that. That's exactly what -- that's exactly what I need. A trap. You know, I think that what's been the most remarkable just been the light that's been shined on a lot of different things, and kind of allowing people to think differently about stuff, because I feel like before, I mean, it really is remarkable, you know that our tax dollars we pay so much that, you know, we get so little, but just -- just how stupid some of the stuff is. When you hear something like foreign aid, you could never criticize that, right? What comes to mind when you hear foreign aid?
GUTFELD: Humanitarian.
TIMPF: You hear the kid, right?
GUTFELD: Yeah, the kid.
TIMPF: The kid in the pile of rubble, was like, a little tin can.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: So, they put oatmeal in, right? And you're like, who would take this from this kid? You would be a monster. But then you -- but then you realize that, OK, they're also funding, you know, whatever, diversity training in Serbia, or whatever else, all this other stuff. So actually, just shining a light on these things, I think, in and of itself, is a remarkable thing, because it's -- and I hope that this happens across departments.
The Defense Department as well, they fail every audit. I mean, we need to look at the what kind of stuff that money is actually being spent on, and not just relying on the positive branding that a lot of these words bring to mind.
GUTFELD: Yeah, it's a great point.
TIMPF: One person is like, hell yeah. It's OK.
GUTFELD: Tyrus, it is a good point. It seems like Trump's Administration is almost doing the work of investigative journalists should have done?
TYRUS: Yeah, that would have been nice. But, you know, journalists, good luck finding them or a dodo. What -- he's -- President Trump learned a lot from not being in the office, and the one thing he learned from the first time is that, even when you get in, the fight just begins. And so many times when Presidents have had the Senate and the House, they think they had time. They could spread things out. We can get a win here, and then, we can get a win there. No, no, no. And before they know it, they don't have the house anymore. So everything ends up beginning shut down and slow down. He's not going to allow that to happen, because -- and what he's doing and the way he's doing it with, I mean, he -- I refer to him as a third Black President, but he is also the most arrogant Black brother I have ever met in my life.
And literally, I got to -- no like, he knows, he's completely aware that everyone's going to find a way, and eventually they're going to get to a couple of these Republicans, you know when -- when the lobbyists, they're eventually going to get to a couple Republicans, all of a sudden they're going to be, like, oh, I'm more conservative, and I have issues with this.
It always happens. So, he's doing it now when they can't, because everyone's watching, and he's showing the show, but -- and then he has time to send a text on a Saturday night, like, Yo, guess who filled Kelly up with water Tyrus? And with pictures. I'm like, how do you have time for this? Because he is make -- he's not sleeping. He knows he's got 100 days to do what he needs to do. And you made a joke about a month ago, and I think it's -- at two years, he might be like, I'm done.
GUTFELD: Yeah, three months.
TYRUS: Jamie, it's yours. Deuces, I'm out. I'll be golf and call me, because he knows -- no, I think, I think that's the plan, is to get it done because he doesn't have to run for re-election.
EPSTEIN: We've never seen anything like this before. I mean, it's very terrorist point, it's very gangster. I mean, you know, politicians, by their nature, say, let's do a commission study something for six months. And then we'll think about getting it done. Trump says, F that, I'm getting it done today.
TYRUS: Because the swamp will fight back.
GUTFELD: Yeah, you do it like the Republicans would take their time. Like, they're like, it's like one chef working on an eight-course meal, and he's like McDonald's is fleeing the burgers into your face, into your fat faces. All right. I don't know why I said fat faces, I apologize. You're all very svelte. Too svelte. Up next, they still sound like clowns when it comes to pronouns.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: They're still on a bender over gender. Over the weekend, the DNC elected its new officers, and following with their woke pronoun rules, they ensure the appropriate number of hes, shes, and neither nors were elected. Roll it, Gladys.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our rules specify that when we have a gender non-binary candidate or officer, the non-binary individual is counted as neither male nor female, and the remaining six officers must be gender-balanced. With the results of the previous elections, our elected officers, at this point, are currently two male and two female. In order to be gender-balanced, we must have at one male, one female and one person of any gender.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Of any gender, that means you, Jamie. That was the opposite of clear. So, how will this all work?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As we must elect a candidate of any gender as well as one male and one female Vice Chair. We will first ask members to elect a candidate of any gender on the first ballot. After a candidate is elected on the first ballot, we'll have one officer of the three, so we will know which position is filled of the one male, one female and one Vice Chair of any gender. Our second ballot will also be for a candidate of any gender. Then, our third ballot will be the third position that is remaining based on the two results.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Now, you know what's funny about this? Do you notice what's missing? Where is the sign language person? Committed suicide. Oh, yeah, you think that's funny? I'll send my letters to you. Julian, this almost goes back to what you said in the A Block. The reason why, I don't think that guy really wanted to do that, but there is a fear of the contempt, so you have to do this kind of like virtue-signaling theater, because you don't want to become the object of all the contempt either.
EPSTEIN: And that's all the Democratic Party is today. It's virtue- signaling, I mean, I felt when I was watching that, that I was watching the Star Trek convention. I mean, Democrats and the left have this crazy cartoon floating around in their head that we live in an oppressive society, and that they are the rescuers of this intersectional matrix of oppressed peoples who are on stolen land, and whose, you know, highest calling is the exaltation of queers in Palestine.
GUTFLELD: Yeah.
EPSTEIN: I mean, it's -- it's insane, and it has birthed what is just nothing more than an identity politics on the left, which has, you know, produced things like DEI, which are race preferences. And, you know, it's extraordinary. The people who they are doing this on behalf of, don't support it. You know, you can go back to the 1970s and 1980s, and you can pull the Black and Brown communities, they have been opposed to gender preferences, race preferences, identity preferences, for 50 years.
But, you know, this is very useful, because it advances the interests of the elites on the left. This sort of virtue signaling enhances the social credit scores of folks on the left, but it is deeply out of touch, and what we saw over the weekend just gives us -- gives us more evidence that the Democrats have learned nothing. And they're not going to change.
GUTFELD: They're not going to change. By the way, same -- same smattering of applause over there in the corner. Have that man taken out. Kat, were you watching that guy? Did you get a sense that he was just not into it? Yeah, he was just like, it was -- you could have put an -- he had an invisible gun to his head.
TIMPF: I feel like you could have said, explain, he would have been like, I cannot. Because who could? And that old lady, did she get up and go to the bathroom while he was talking? Because while he was starting going, blah blah, blah, blah gender, blah gender, blah, blah, which is, that's all we all heard, right? She's sitting there, like, what, like what, like what. And then, when he's still going, she's not there, and then she comes back. I feel like she was like, this is the perfect time to go to the bathroom. I'm not going to miss anything, because I still don't know what he said.
LISSOW: Neither did I.
TIMPF: And it's just, who is this for? Who is this for? Because it's not for anyone as he would -- of any gender, as he would put it, right? Nobody's helped by this.
GUTFELD: No.
TIMPF: It makes -- it's ridiculous, it's nonsense.
GUTFELD: The fact that it didn't --
TIMPF: Maybe Republicans are helped by it.
GUTFELD: Yeah, definitely. I want more of this. All right. But the proof that it didn't help anybody was they still elected two White guys, and one of them was, was David Hogg, the Vice Chair, he looks about 10, but he is a White dude.
TYRUS: But he's a -- but he was an apologetic White dude.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TYRUS: Which is fine. He just was confusing, because he didn't have his man bun in. It threw us off a little bit. Listen, there's not enough weed in Humboldt, California or Oregon to understand the words that was coming out of his mouth. And I think I -- I also think it's -- it's important that he was letting everyone know, former Chair, that he could not wait to leave this job.
OK? So, he read that, and yes, Kat, she went to the bathroom, and then, you know what she did? She used this like I would have, because the people we didn't see would have also left. There was a lot -- everyone got up to go to the bathroom, and then, when you go out to get the bathroom, you have to look for the correct gender bathroom. That's a whole other 15 minutes.
So, the great bathroom search for your gender alleviated you from hearing that (BEEP) that was coming out of his mouth, because basically he was like, if you have to, like, you have to get elected first. That's the one thing I learned from that, because you could get elected be like I'm in, but oh, you're the third man elected, so you're out. Unless, oh, I identify as a non-binary Lama, then you're in.
GUTFELD: Yes. And then, what would be great when you say unless, and they go, well, I'm non-binary, and then you go, prove it, and then you start on betting.
TYRUS: Well, if they're non-binary, wouldn't they just have to sit there?
GUTFELD: I guess so, I don't know. You're non-binary, Jamie, in that neither sex likes you.
LISSOW: Ok. I don't -- I don't disagree with you. I don't think that's the word for it. I think Tyrus makes a good point. I think the woman in the backroom was the only one we could see walking out. Do you think the priorities are messed up? Like, we're in a serious situation to be talking about this. This is like, if you're on a sinking boat and people are pouring buckets of water, and this guy's like, I got swimsuits.
I got brand new swimsuits. I am not -- I actually didn't know what non- binary was before we came on TV. I go, I don't want to seem ignorant on the show, let me look, and first I try to figure it out by myself, I go, non- binary. I think that means you either a one or a zero. That's not what it means.
I looked it up and -- I looked up non-binary definition enter on Google, and it said gender fluid. And I was like, OK, what do you do if you still don't know? And I looked up gender fluid definition, enter, and it said non-binary. And I was like, I am caught in a loop of not knowing (BEEP).
GUTFELD: Yeah, right. Non-binary is one and zeros.
LISSOW: Yeah.
GUTFELD: Yeah. That's what they describe the panelists at The View. Oh, come on. Oh, I don't want claps. That was a terrible joke. Up next, will Joe go from failed President to Hollywood resident?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A story in five words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Biden signs with talent agency. Kat, Joe Biden just linked a lucrative deal with Hollywood powerhouse talent agency CAA, or caa (ph), as he explores his opportunities post-presidency. He's expected to make a boatload of cash for speaking engagements, some potential book deals, much like he did after his vice presidency. Is this swell?
TIMPF: We all knew this was going to happen. Just because he can't feed soup himself doesn't mean he's not going to make a ton of money. But they won't give us what we really want, which, I think we all really want. I want just cameras in the house.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: What is going on in that house?
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: I don't want the scripted crap they're going to give us, the ghostwritten book they're going to give us. I don't want -- they're going to give -- I want to just see it, as it is.
GUTFELD: It would be huge.
TIMPF: Truly. I feel like we haven't had really good reality TV since "The Jersey Shore" era or early "Vanderpump", and I think that this could be a whole turnaround for the industry if we just let it happen.
GUTFELD: Yes, they'd need a toilet camera.
TIMPF: Unleashed.
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: No, no, no, you would need a toilet camera.
GUTFELD: Who's to say I don't have one? In the office men's room.
Tyrus, could it be that this deal was made through Obama to sweeten Joe's exit, that he wasn't going to leave, and they said, look, you leave, we've got this nice, plum gig?
TYRUS: That sounds wonderful, but that is not how this -- Dr. Jill is just mean.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: We're going to milk this turnip for everything we can get. You are going to make commercials. You're going to see Biden trying to jump over cars doing the O.J. Hertz commercials. They're going to put his blundering ass to work. Now when they fall it'll be up for a sponsored event. Tired of slipping on the couch? Try Stick'ems. Like, they're going --
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Because they have to show that he still has some influence. They still have to sell those speaking engagements. So it's going to be, guess who is on the bachelor to give wisdom to younger men about experience. Former President Joe Biden! And he is going to come out and be like, huh? And then there will be a little cattle prod, and he will speak. She is going to ride this horse until the wheels come off. He will play the dead guy next to the actor in the soap operas. He's going to be an extra.
GUTFELD: He would be a great dead guy in like --
TYRUS: No, he'll -- it up. He will keep sitting up. And they'll be like, it's not a horror movie. Dead is staying data.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Jamie, are you jealous? He is getting more opportunities than you will ever see.
LISSOW: When I saw this, I was like at my age I thought he was having a hard time booking me. He's got to book Joe Biden. CAA is a great agency. I feel bad for him. I did hear they already booked him three appointments at a neurologist. I'm curious, like what -- I am with Kat. I would love to see some -- like what is this show going to be like? I heard one of the reps is like, Joe, do you want any kind of still on stage? And Joe was like, no, I got it covered. I'm wearing a diaper.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: I actually heard that they were going to book all his gigs and then at the last minute Kamala was going to do them without asking the audience.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Julian, did you run into the Bidens? You must have run into the Bidents, because you were in the Clinton era. Yes. So I think people don't remember, Joe wasn't that sharp to begin with.
EPSTEIN: Never.
GUTFELD: No.
EPSTEIN: Never. And always insecure about his academic pedigree, and always trying to prove himself and always trying to tell people he was smarter than the other. I know that because I was on the Judiciary Committee in the House right after he was Senate chair. Look, one of my favorite movies was "The Manchurian Candidate." This could be something interesting if he makes it the ventriloquist president. I think we would be very curious to find out how he tried to pull the wool over the American public's eyes since 2021 when, according to "The Wall Street Journal", reporting on a lot of other reporting, the Democrats in the House and Senate all knew that he was not up to the job. And how he and the Democratic politburo were able to pull the wool over the eyes because we have, to Tyrus's point, not really a functioning media anymore. I mean, this was obvious to any of was that was watching. But it's still a fascinating story, so maybe we get something out of it.
GUTFELD: It's true. They did hundreds of movies about Watergate. Right? Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I feel like there were 100. Are they going to do a movie about probably one of the biggest political coverups in recent history? I doubt it.
EPSTEIN: Sure. And all the Democrats talking about how important democracy is. I mean, what bigger story is there than pulling the wool over the American, trying to pull the wool over the American public's eyes that the guy in charge was actually capable?
But the irony is, even before the debate, 80 percent of the American public did not want to see him run. So it really wasn't very effective either. So maybe we won't learn that much.
GUTFELD: Who knows?
All right, coming up, the Democrat gov who showed an illegal some love.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got another clip of you. It's Video of the Day Part Two.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Was a governor's humblebrag real or just a gag? Our second video of the day comes to us from New Jersey Democrat Governor Phil Murphy where he admits that he is actually harboring an illegal immigrant. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. PHIL MURPHY, (D-NJ): I don't want to get into too much detail, but there is someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to. And we said, you know what? Let's have her live at our house above our garage. And good luck to the feds coming in trying to get her.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to. That was 17 words to say illegal alien.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That is like calling Governor Murphy a feminine product used to cleanse your nether regions when you just could have said douchebag.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Tyrus?
TYRUS: Yes?
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Isn't this the best? He tried to pull a virtue signal and got called on it.
TYRUS: I disagree. He didn't virtue signal. He hates his maid.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: She starched his socks the wrong way or something, and he's like -- I'm not saying she is a legal, but her stuff isn't right. And you can try to get her above our garage.
TIMPF: I agree, I agree.
TYRUS: Between the hours of 3:00 and 6:00 p.m., because she is certainly not in the house doing the dishes like she was supposed to!
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: Yes. Or, she is, which usually happens with a lot of politicians, the maid is late.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: So I can't raise it because she is illegal. And we are not doing the being born in the United States anymore.
GUTFELD: Anchor babies are no longer --
TYRUS: Yes, yes. So she's got to -- we want to protect her, but --
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Jamie, you also live above the garage. So you must have some empathy for what is going on here.
LISSOW: Yes, I have to be very quiet so they do not know I am there.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: The weeping keeps me up that night.
GUTFELD: Honey, do you hear that strange crying? It sounds like a lonely divorced man.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: That is so funny, though. Tyrus is so right. This guy is not good at hiding people.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: He is the worst hider of people. And that was the longest way to say illegal that anybody has ever done it. He's like, she doesn't quite have their legal document. But you are right, though, he is like, yes, he's illegal -- that would be like going, I think you are right. I think she wants him to be found. That would be like going, yes, I know there is a warrant out for my ex-wife, but I'm going to keep her in the last room on the left at the 6861 Hines Avenue.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: In case you want to send somebody.
TYRUS: You can try.
GUTFELD: Yes. Julian, he dared them to come get her. Should they?
EPSTEIN: Yes. I mean, freeze frame on this. This is everything that is wrong with the Democratic Party. Engaging in illegal behavior, criminal behavior, harboring an illegal, virtue signaling about it like he is the tough guy, and then collapsing as soon as he is called on it. If there's anything, it just shows that he doesn't even mean what he is saying. The whole thing is for show. And this is sort of what, if you were to take an iconic moment and try to understand why the Democrats -- three out of ten people, only three out of ten people in this country think the Democrats have a favorable opinion of Democrats. Only two out of ten men in this country. If you want to know why, just freeze-frame this moment and look at it. It will tell you everything that is wrong with the Democratic Party.
GUTFELD: Yes. Kat, you said this was your favorite story.
TIMPF: Yes, it is. It's amazing. Because it is obviously self-promotional and as self-serving as it gets, because as Tyrus said, as Jamie said, if he cared about this person he wouldn't be like this is -- imagine her above the garage, like, bro, what the --
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: The only other possibility besides that is he actually doesn't think that ICE would go after somebody like this who is kind of minding her business, not a criminal. So those are the two possibilities. Both of them undercut whatever argument he was trying to make. And he does so, so confidently. Like, I am such a bad boy. You are not. You're pathetic. By the way, reminds me, if I ever get to know this guy, not to tell him anything.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: We're going to have to wait -- Kat, we're going to wait to see how this plays out. If he comes out tomorrow like, listen, what I said about my maid was a little off, but listen, my wife also is not from this country. Her and her mother her mother-in-law, they came over here without their papers, and I still love them anyways. And they are not above the garage. They are in the main house. But again, you just try and get them. I double dog dare you to try and get them, especially when I am at the gym between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. Don't you have -- I dare you.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, up next it was no hassle for Jaden to wear a castle.
(APPLAUSE)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five more words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Jaden Smith wears a house. Tyrus, Will Smith's son Jaden wore a black castle on his head at the Grammys on Sunday. It's described as being a symbol of eternity, sensuality, and resilience, but I took it as an affront to all those people who lost their homes in southern California.
TYRUS: Yes, this is when sometimes as a dad you go over to the mom and say we are getting a DNA test.
(LAUGHTER)
TYRUS: There is no way, no way that came from my loins. It's impossible. Just tell me you are mad at me. Tell me you do not like me. Tell me I wasn't there enough for you as a kid where you can go to Dr. Drew and work that -- out. But putting a castle on your head, son doesn't help anything. It actually reinforces why I spent more time on the road.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Jamie, interesting fact. That castle is actually larger than your current studio apartment to live in.
LISSOW: This looks just what it looked like when Tyrus visited me.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: This is crazy. My friend was actually at the Grammys. And I go how was it? And they go, I don't know. I was sitting behind Jaden Smith. Couldn't see --
GUTFELD: Julian, that castle was actually done by a fashion designer from Transylvania, which I never thought existed. It cost $4,600, you can get it on her website. What do you think, stylish?
EPSTEIN: I think this is the kind of thing you do when you figure out the American people aren't listening to you anymore, Hollywood. This is the dunce cap that Hollywood is putting on, which is a fitting tribute to a year in which the American people sort of just rejected Hollywood entirely, particularly when they stuck their noses into politics in the way they just sort of recoiled against.
GUTFELD: Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Kat, is there even an artificial stance you could take to defend this fashion --
TIMPF: Oh, no, I'm sincerely going to defend this. Absolutely.
GUTFELD: OK.
TIMPF: Of course, Jaden Smith is wearing a castle on his head. Do you know how impossible it must be to get any attention in that house?
(LAUGHTER)
TIMPF: Your dad is running around hitting people. Your mom is just like, I have sex with men who aren't my husband. No one is asking her, but every chance she gets, she is like, I have sex with other guys than my husband, who is known for being the genie in "Aladdin." Imagine those are your parents. You at how he's doing it. He is wearing a castle on his head.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Do you know who mad about this? Kanye West's wife, because she --
TIMPF: I'm surprised he wasn't naked. His mom would be like, I have sex with men who aren't my husband. Look over here, please.
TYRUS: I believe the word is "entanglement."
TIMPF: Entanglement.
TIMPF: I have entanglements.
TIMPF: What did you have for breakfast, yesterday? I'll tell you what I have had, sex with men who aren't my husband.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
TYRUS: Yes, the old kind of the castle complex.
GUTFELD: But it is true, that can't be comfortable when you are sitting there. What if you have got to go to the bathroom and you are wearing this head thing, and it's like you can't have a during.
LISSOW: I was at the gym the other day, and this guy was working on his neck. And I was like, why would you do that? Oh, castle hat.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, I'm glad I waited for that joke.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: We'll be right back.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Out of time! Jamie Lissow, Julian Epstein, Timpf, Tyrus, studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
