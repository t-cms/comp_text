BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Every once in a while, we'll be here on the North Lawn of the White House. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this Special Report. Fair, balanced and still unafraid. The Ingraham Angle starts now.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. Thanks so much for joining us. Promises made, promises kept. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. What a breathtaking 36 hours.
(VIDEO PLAYING)
INGRAHAM: On the campaign trail, he promised to never stop working for you, and I don't think we have ever seen a president who packed more into one day.
(VIDEO PLAYING)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Protect and defend.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Constitution of the United States.
TRUMP: The Constitution of the United States. Now, we just had a great time. We just had a great day.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Join me in raising a glass to the President of the United States, President Donald Trump. Here, here.
TRUMP: That's a big one, lot of big ones? There's never been a first day like yesterday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, holy cow, like the past few days have been like a bracing, but kind of welcome shock to the system, because we basically have had no president for the last four years. All we had was a sad old man who they shuffled out to read some things, and then who was shuttled back off the stage or the platform, and then he was put back into hiding. But yesterday and today and for the next four years, we're going to see a real president, and I was blessed to have had a bird's eye view of history.
(VIDEO PLAYING)
INGRAHAM: Now, people talk so much about how a president look, can he get a lot done in the first 100 days? But I was thinking about this today and watching what's happened over the last 36 hours, and we have to all just think of it this way, Trump is built differently because Donald Trump focuses on getting as much done. This means pushing his staff, by the way, but getting as much done as possible every single day. And of course, you still make the time to go to three balls at the end of that day. But Trump's an original. When before we had a president who, you know, could take a question every six months from the press, we had a president yesterday who signed stacks of executive orders and actually answer questions at the same time. It was, it was a sight to behold. Jesse Watters and I were watching this.
It was during our, both of our shows, and, you know, the shows got cut short, but it was unbelievable. And then you have to ask, really, why are so many people feeling positive right now? Because I think most of us felt a deep sense of unease and real anxiety in the world as it is, about having an actual -- not having an actual president capable of confronting crises and making critical decisions in the White House, having a strong leader in charge and a competent White House staff was something America really missed. And what about the transparency? Well, Trump told us what he was going to do, and now he's in the process of doing it.
Now, contrast that to Biden world, where covering up was their MO. They didn't just cover up his mental condition, though they lied about the condition of the economy, the truth about the border, the truth about the war in Ukraine, it was one giant cover up. But Trump is telling you what he's thinking on all the issues, even if you don't always agree. He puts it out there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you want to keep H-1B's, or do you want to get --
TRUMP: I like, I like both sides of the argument, but I also like very competent people coming into our country. And I'm not just talking about engineers, I'm talking about people at all levels, Maitre D's, wine, you know, experts, even waiters, high quality waiters.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now the Angle will dig into the foreign worker issue as we have in the past, but we'll do that in the coming days and weeks. But were Dems in the press really able to land a glove on Trump today? No, but they did sputter.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): It's a golden age for these fat cats, but Democrats are fighting for you.
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): His first actions as president haven't done what he promised voters he would do.
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): The very heart of what the American voter told us they wanted, just wasn't there.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This White House is about one simple thing. If you storm the Capitol in his name to keep him in power, he'll help you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now, what they're really mad about, it's not the pardons, the J6- ers, obviously Biden set a much more dangerous precedent. They're mad that he's actually delivering on his promises one by one, including his pledge to bring jobs into the United States with his announcement today called Stargate, where SoftBank and OpenAI and Oracle have all pledged to work together, and it will be a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MASAYOSHI SON, CEO, SOFTBANK: This is the beginning of golden age. We wouldn't have decided, unless you won, we would immediately start deploying $100 billion with a goal of making $500 billion within next four years.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now you heard him, they wouldn't have done this if Trump had not won. So the pace here is astounding. From his executive orders on gender and DEI, leaving the W.H.O, exiting the Climate Accord, plus he ordered a review of our trade policies. It hasn't got as much attention, but this is being done across government, and the individual agencies will have to report back on April 1st. That will pave the way, in a very smart way for new tariffs.
But every one of these orders was well-executed, all signed off by lawyers, with the ultimate goal, of course, of withstanding legal challenge, and there will be many. There are already legal challenges, but don't take what we've seen in Trump's first 36 hours for granted. This all takes real work, hundreds of hours of work by teams of people, and they were able to pull it off because his staff is devoted and competent and motivated. Americans just want to return to excellence, to merit, and they got it with Trump 47. Isn't it great to have a real president again? And that's the Angle.
Joining me now is Jonathan Turley, George Washington University Law Professor, Fox News Contributor. Professor, moments ago, President Trump signed another executive order, this one ending what they call illegal DEI. The White House says this will terminate radical DEI preferencing in federal contracting and direct federal agencies to combat private sector discrimination. Professor, how soon will we start seeing legal challenges to this?
JONATHAN TURLEY, GWU LAW PROFESSOR: Well, we saw a flurry of legal challenges immediately after Trump took office, but it's going to take more than a legal flash mob to reverse some of these measures. To some degree, Trump has been advantaged with the fact that we've had divided government in Congress, which meant that many of the things that President Biden did, he did with executive orders. And what you can do by an executive order you can usually undo by executive order, but this is really a flurry of executive orders that we're all trying to keep up with, I did glance at that recently minted EO, and it's very interesting.
One of the things that he asks the Department of Education and the Justice Department to look at is to fully enforce the Harvard decision by the Supreme Court. That was the decision that ended affirmative action in the admissions process, there have been complaints that universities had already prepared for the next round to circumvent the impact of that decision.
Trump is ordering the departments to get on that to use their powers, including their Investigatory Powers, determine if there's circumvention occurring. And that is the view of some after the Supreme Court handed down its historic ruling.
INGRAHAM: And Jonathan, he also wants his new attorney general assuming Pam Bondi, I'm sure she'll get confirmed to review all activities of all departments in the federal government over the last four years and identify any instances where the department or agency's conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of the order. And this is about the weaponization of government asking for appropriate remedial actions to be taken.
Now this is a big order, and some would say it might be a tiny bit general, but nevertheless, it makes a statement about what the Trump family and his associates have endured over the past, really, nine years.
TURLEY: Once again, this is within the navigational beacons for executive orders. They don't have binding legal authority, but they are basically directions to federal agencies, and this is a president who really is building on his first term. If you recall, when he first came into office, he was came face to face with an acting attorney general who ordered the entire department to stand down and not assist him in his immigration policy reforms.
I consider that order, by the way, to be grossly inappropriate, and she ultimately, as she had planned, left office. But Trump had spent his first term dealing with a lot of this resistance from within the agencies. That's why he's moving very quickly on not just weaponization, but also to remind all the employees that it is their duty to carry out constitutional, lawful orders of the president, regardless of whether they disagree with his policies.
INGRAHAM: And rescheduling federal employees for the viewing audience, that's an entirely new way of eliminating federal workers by, quote, rescheduling them, which is another way of approaching government cuts. And a lot of these agencies, the President believes are bloated and just loaded with people they don't need. They didn't come to work for the last four years, and no one really noticed.
TURLEY: Right. And that has already been challenged, and the thrust of that challenge is that other federal laws guarantee due process, and that by redesignating them, you are cutting back on legislative changes. A lot of these efforts are meant to slow things down, including the challenge to DOGE. You know, the challenge there is that is to say, what is DOGE and what the challenges insist that's an advisory committee, and advisory committees have to be open and balanced, but they're a bit premature. They pull that trigger, in my view, too quickly.
DOGE is very much a work in progress. But the other problem that they're going to have is they can throw sand in those works, but Congress has a parallel DOGE effort going on. They're not going to be delayed by litigation, so I'm not too sure how successful these initial attacks are going to be.
INGRAHAM: Well, Jonathan, this will be a pace that we haven't seen, and I don't think we didn't see it first term, but they know the territory now. They know the challenges. And do you agree with my assessment that each of these orders was reviewed by their legal team, and they understood that these lawsuits were going to be challenged, and I don't think a single one of them was issued without that in mind.
TURLEY: No, these are obviously well-prepared EO's, and some of them, by the way, may be intending to start a fight. The EO on birthright citizenship may be an effort to get this into the court. You know, there is that sweet spot for a two term president, the first two years, you really have to put a score on the board before half time, because those last two years, the pace slows down considerably. And so they may want this in court so that they can get that resolved, and if necessary, start a constitutional amendment process.
INGRAHAM: Jonathan, always great to see you. Thank you very much.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA (D) 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: This has been the most transparent government, most transparent administration that we have seen in a very, very long time.
JEN PSAKI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: His objective and his commitment is to bring transparency and truth back to government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Promises made, promises broken. Well, no one ever expected Obama, Biden to be transparent with the American people. They don't, much even, like most of the American people, Biden routinely ignored the press and only called on reporters if his aides gave him a card with a very specific list of names and probably knew a lot of the questions or the gist of a lot of the questions ahead of time. But what about Donald Trump? Well, he's not afraid of questions.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Does Biden never do news conferences like this? How many news conferences Peter has he done like this?
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Like this?
TRUMP: None.
DOOCY: Zero.
TRUMP: And it would be zero for the next infinity, for infinity, it would be zero.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Yes. So, as I mentioned earlier, for like almost 50 minutes last night, Trump signed executive orders, took questions at the same time, and then today, he went out again in front of the media. And again took questions.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Update on the Gaza ceasefire, and are you planning to travel to the Middle East soon?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you going to keep sending weapons to Ukraine, or are you going to send -- turn off the tap soon?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So this is just completely, again, a shock to the system. It's a new era of transparency, and even some old foes have to admit it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: He wanted to set a contrast with Biden. You know, by going sort of having this rolling press conference, I actually think it's refreshing for presidents to be, I mean, I was among those who was critical of the lack of exposure of President Biden. And I think it's good for presidents to be exposed.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now. Alina Habba, Counselor to President Trump. I was able to see her last night in our really uncomfortable shoes, standing, standing at the bar. Alina, first of all --
ALINA HABBA, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm still in pain.
INGRAHAM: First of all, your parents have adopted me, so I'm just saying I love your parents. They're amazing people. I got to know them.
HABBA: Yes, they let me know.
INGRAHAM: Incredible. Thank you for sharing them. But will the President commit Alina to doing press conferences every week, every two weeks, to continue what he says is going to be the most transparent administration. It seems like it's no problem for him.
HABBA: First of all, he doesn't need to commit it. I think he's shown everybody today, yesterday, the minute that he was sworn in, he got to work. Actually, we've been working since he was elected on November 5th. But there's nobody that speaks better about the President's thoughts, policies and reactions better than President Donald Trump himself, and that's the truth of it. We can all spin. We can do whatever, but we finally have a president, Laura, and we have somebody who's not afraid to answer tough questions himself directly from the boss's mouth.
And it's just been tremendous being there, seeing how hard everybody is working, these EO's that have been coming out, really reversing the damage that's been done and putting important things first, America first. Frankly, it's just been great. Yeah, he's going to be doing this a lot. That's President Trump's way. It's his words. You don't have to hear from anybody else.
INGRAHAM: I call it a shock to the system. But I actually think we got so used to a president in hiding and then aides kind of covering that up that you almost forgot what it was like to have a real president. So I think people are -- it's going to take a little while to get used to that again, but in a good way. Now the executive order Alina declaring two genders. I mean, it seems obvious to most people, but it set off one of the NBC reporters, Yamiche Alcindor, here's what she, quote, reported.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, NBC NEWS: A legal expert told me that if you're someone who's transgender, who has a passport that maybe has gender X on it, they would caution you not to leave the country, because you could literally be detained by border agents because you couldn't have your gender entered into the system if the Trump administration is no longer identifying it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Alina, is that fear well-founded?
HABBA: Yes, and you're going to be shipped to Mars. I mean, they're fearmongering. This is what we know they do. This is why CNN ratings are so low.
INGRAHAM: It's NBC.
HABBA: If they started arguing about facts, we'd be much better. It's all the same. There's Left-wing radical Left-wing media is giving you fake facts so that you think, my God, what is President Trump doing? You know what we're doing. We're restoring America. It's based in God. We were made a man and woman. We're not letting boys and girls bathrooms and vice versa. We're making you go to schools and get jobs based on merit, not on the identity, making people worried that they have to check a box and be another. We're getting America back. People need to have faith in that, and this is not a fearmongering thing. It's taking us to a simpler, more constitutionally protected America. It's the America we know. We haven't seen it for a while, but he's getting us back there very quickly.
INGRAHAM: All right, Alina, great to see you. Get some rest or a little bit. Thanks so much.
HABBA: Yes, thank you.
INGRAHAM: All right, just ahead, Trump's keeping his promises, including cracking down on birthright citizenship. The legality and the reality next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Birthright. That's a big one. It's ridiculous. We're the only country in the world that does this with birthright, as you know, and it's just absolutely ridiculous. But, you know, we'll see. We think we have very good grounds. Certain people have wanted to do this for decades.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Of course, the idea as a policy matter is completely correct. It's obvious the idea that a child born here should automatically get U.S. citizenship, even when neither parent is a U.S. citizen. Well, it's invited huge fraud upon our system. Birth motels in New York and California. It even has a name, birth tourism. But the 14th Amendment of the Constitution does present a legal hurdle for the President. Now the Supreme Court hasn't definitively ruled on this yet, and 18 blue states and the ACLU are already suing the 14th Amendment question.
Joining us now is Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt. Senator as a former state attorney general, this is going to obviously be subject to litigation. The court has not definitively ruled on this yet, but knowing this court, I'm not sure how it would come out, I tend to think it might come out against what the President and all of us would like. But why was it important for President Trump to issue this order?
SEN. ERIC SCHMITT (R-MO): Well, it's addressing a real perverse incentive that currently exists, whether it's Remain in Mexico, making Mexico the waiting room to get rid of the incentive of catch and release. That's an obvious one, but here in birthright citizenship, it has created this perverse incentive for people to come here legally. If they have a child, then at that point, that child would be a citizen under that interpretation. But here's why that's wrong. Senator Howard, who was the author of that amendment, was very specific. You can -- he's quoted, he's written about it. It wasn't intended for illegal aliens. It wasn't even intended for people here lawfully who had children like ambassadors.
So he was clear that sort of the intent behind it. It was specifically meant to address the Dred Scott case, which the Dred Scott case said, effectively, that slaves were not citizens. They weren't -- they weren't subject to the rights; they didn't get to enjoy the rights of being a citizen, the privileges and immunities of being a citizen. So it meant to address that specific issue at that moment in time.
And so Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit, who would you know, never could be considered a friend to conservative on these issues, he agrees with that interpretation this wouldn't apply. Also, Harry Reid, who's no friend to conservatives, also agreed that this is not intended to be for children of illegal immigrants. So you're right. It's going to get litigated, but I think President Trump spoke very clearly on this, and I'm glad that he did.
INGRAHAM: Yes, I mean, it's all about how you interpret the phrase and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, and so it will be fascinating to see how this plays out, but I think this is going all the way to the Supreme Court. Now the Democrat A.G. in Arizona apparently doesn't really know the people she actually represents. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KRIS MAYES (D), ATTORNEY GENERAL, ARIZONA: I don't think that voters in Arizona, whoever they voted for, ever thought that they would be voting to really voting to undermine birthright citizenship or to destroy birthright citizenship.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Senator, this is a very lopsided issue that runs against the Democrats, but that's a Democrat. State Attorney General, does this not confirm, in people's mind the idea that Democrats put illegal immigrants first and not American citizens rights.
SCHMITT: Yes, they also don't really understand. As you could tell by that quote, really what November 5, 2024, was all about. President Trump, you saw him on the campaign trail. Spent a lot of time with him on the campaign trail, he spoke about illegal immigration all the time. He would talk about this issue all the time. There are 15 million people here illegally because we've created an incentive structure for them to come. They get taxpayer benefits. There's no wall to prevent them from coming.
Mexico is no longer the waiting room. So the American people knew exactly what they were doing when they voted for President Trump. They wanted to end this invasion at our southern border. You would think that the Attorney General of a border state would understand it. But again, I think it goes to how out of touch these Democrats are on the issues that matter to real people.
INGRAHAM: All right, Senator, great to see you. Thank you very much. We come back, the faux outrage of Democrats on the January 6th pardons, what it really means, coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Right on cue when Trump did what he promised to do and pardoned the January 6th defendants, the never Trump media went bananas.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Trump is pardoning people who committed violence against cops and tried to overturn an election.
UNKNOWN: I guess, back the blue doesn't mean very much to this group.
UNKNOWN: A mother from Pennsylvania who took an ice axe and then a battering ram to a window to get people into the Capitol. She came out to her family, to these supporters, and then was putting on a Trump hat.
UNKNOWN: That is their biggest fear. There are now a group of people out on the streets who have shown a willingness to do -- to take -- to use violence in the name of Donald Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Okay, they found their new resistance line. They're back at it. But where was their demand for jail time and their outrage when the George Floyd rioters burned down American cities? They did billions in damage coast to coast. Several people, I think more than a dozen died.
And if they're really worried about unprecedented use of pardons, why aren't they pressing the issue of a president preemptively pardoning his family members and their spouses, and almost an entire congressional committee getting preemptively pardoned. From Trump's apparent point of view here, I guess it's been four years since January 6th, and he wants to put this entire episode behind us.
Clearly, we're a small minority who engaged in violence, but the overwhelming majority were charged with misdemeanors, was trespassing, and parading in the Capitol. Plus, were defendants really given their due process rights is another argument, considering the mysteriously missing and potentially exculpatory evidence in the case.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: The National Archive and records administration wants to know how the Secret Service lost text messages link to the assault on the Capitol. The agency confirmed yesterday that the messages cannot be recovered.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, how convenient. They cannot be recovered. Joining me now are two of the beneficiaries of Trump's pardons, Brandon Straka and Isabella Deluca. Brandon, do you believe that you, and I know the answer to this, but I don't think our viewers do, that when this went down, and remind us of what you were charged with, that you were given a fair trial?
BRANDON STRAKA, JAN. 6 TRUMP PARDON RECIPIENT: No, my case was a lie from the very beginning. I stood outside of the east side of the Capitol for eight minutes shooting a video. When I arrived, there were no police officers on the east side of the building. Nobody was rioting, nobody was committing violence or destroying windows or fighting with anyone, and the doors of the Capitol were open.
I stood outside of the building for eight minutes shooting a video. I never entered the Capitol, never engaged in any violence, vandalism, theft or destruction. But because of who I am and the success of my organization, the Walkway Movement, they decided to come at me and come at me hard.
And two and a half weeks after I posted that video, the FBI raided my home at dawn, got me out of bed, put me in handcuffs, began stripping my apartment of computers, iPads, hard drives, thumb drives, camera equipment, put me in handcuffs and took me to jail.
When I got out of jail, I learned that they were charging me with two felonies and a misdemeanor and threatening to add the now infamous 1512 obstruction of an official proceeding felony. So, I was potentially facing 30 to 35 years in prison for the eight minutes that I stood non-violently outside of the Capitol.
But to make this entire thing stick, they created this story that I stood outside of the Capitol shouting, go, go, go, to encourage people to enter the building and take it, take it, to encourage people to take a shield from an officer. I did no such thing. It never happened.
Nonetheless, I took a misdemeanor plea deal rather than choosing to go to trial. And part of my misdemeanor plea deal was signing their statement of offense saying that I did those things when I did not do those things.
INGRAHAM: Well, a lot of people signed a lot of admissions of guilt because of the same kind of situation. They didn't want to go to jail for 30 years. Now, Isabella, Congressman Raskin of the J6 committee says that his pardon from Biden is completely different from yours and other J6 defendants, watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): The people who were pardoned in the morning were pardoned because we were innocent and Donald Trump was threatening Liz Cheney and Benny Thompson and others with fraudulent political prosecutions. The people who were just pardoned a little while ago were pardoned because they were guilty.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Isabella, your reaction to that, given what you were charged with. Tell me, first of all, what you were charged with and why Raskin is off base here.
ISABELLA DELUCA, JAN 6. TRUMP PARDON RECIPIENT: Yeah, so I was charged back in March of 2024 with theft of government property for touching a table. They accused me of --
INGRAHAM: Wait, touching a what?
DELUCA: Touching a table. They accused me of stealing the table. They charged me with trespassing and obstruction of a government proceeding. But based on what Governor Raskin had said, I mean, I think there's a big problem when the people who were prosecuting the January 6 cases are pardoned before the people who were actually persecuted for January 6.
INGRAHAM: I'm trying to get my head around, take the table. Did you remove a table from the Capitol?
DELUCA: No, I touched a table. Like, I put my hand on a table and they accused me of stealing the table, theft of government property. And they came to me with a plea deal the day before the election saying that if I pled guilty to stealing the table, that carried a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine, that they would drop my trespassing charges.
INGRAHAM: This is -- Brandon, you've been on me for years on this. I'm so glad you told your story. Isabella, we're going to continue covering this because I think -- actually, people have to really understand what happens with these prosecutors and how these cases go down, because this could happen again unless this is prevented from happening again. Brandon, Isabella, both of you, again, we'll continue telling these stories and yours is important, thank you.
DELUCA: Thank you.
STRAKA: Thank you.
INGRAHAM: All right, coming up, a woke bishop tries to lecture President Trump and his family. It was supposed to be a national prayer service, but yes, it was another tedious liberal with Trump Derangement Syndrome. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: President Trump, Vice President Vance, and their families attended the National Prayer Service. It's a tradition after the inauguration, and it happens at the Washington Cathedral. But rather than a Christian service about God and country, they were forced to listen to the rantings of a lunatic.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARIANN EDGAR BUDDE, ESPICOPAL BISHOP OF WASHINGTON D.C.: In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country. We're scared now. There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic, Republican, and independent families. Some who fear for their lives.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And her diatribe didn't stop there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUDDE: And the people. The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, who labor in poultry farms and meat packing plants, who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants, and work the night shifts in hospitals, they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals.
I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now for a reaction is Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo. All right, Raymond, the faces of the Trump and Vance families. J.D. Vance, I think he had the best, but tell me what you saw there.
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it looked like a foul smell had been released into the National Cathedral, and maybe it had. I mean, look at Trump's face there. It's hilarious. But they were having none of it. And for this bishop to use this moment, Laura, that's supposed to be an interfaith prayer service into a political lecture, it's really a misuse of religion here.
And, I mean, you know, they came together, the Trump family, the Vance family, they came to pray for the nation not to be lectured by this woman who looks like, you know, Kate McKinnon after a rainstorm. I mean, she's a mess. And the speech was a complete, like, discarded propaganda you'd hear in Union Square or something.
INGRAHAM: Yeah. It was like an old NPR, one of those all things considered on NPR. You expected the old NPR music to pop up in the background, right? The people who pick our crops. Because Americans, let's just say, in their view, American citizens, they don't get the courtesy of having -- you can't have compassion for them, right? You have to only have compassion for the people who cross our border illegally. And if you don't, you're just not a good Christian. It's ridiculous.
All right. Well, afterward, Raymond, Trump reacted to this service like this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: It's a message of a call for justice, for swift justice for George Floyd, for systemic justice for all brown and black people who have been under the knee of this country in ways that we have witnessed time and again.
UNKNOWN: What is your message to President Trump today?
UNKNOWN: I've given up speaking to President Trump. We need to replace President Trump. We need leadership that will lead us in the ways that this country deserves.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: OK, obviously. Yeah, go that way.
ARROYO: Well, that was the Episcopal bishop, Mariann Edgar Budde. And here's the problem. The inaugural committee, frankly, should have bailed the moment they saw she was leading this prayer service. She's always been more politician than preacher, Laura. And look, when you unpack her strident hatred of President Trump, I don't know why they put him in this position, frankly. He should not have been in the room with this.
They should have moved the prayer service to the Basilica of the National Shrine. Got a nice priest or bishop to come out and lead it, and it could have been very pleasant. We need to pray, not P-R-E-Y on the president.
INGRAHAM: Raymond, anyone lecturing us about the George Floyd riots that they were -- with justice for George Floyd when it was destroying people's communities and livelihoods. In one of those N95 masks or those masks with the vents, I can't -- that brings back such a nightmare vision for most Americans to see some liberal individuals screaming through a mask.
I mean, we want to leave that behind, but we had to see that. It was 2020, that was the bishop.
ARROYO: If we have that reaction of President Trump though today after the service, this is why the man won. And you alluded to this early on in your Angle. And, you know, he comes out and just says it like it is. He's not holding back. He never did. But this term you feel he's not going to hold back at all.
INGRAHAM: Yeah. I guess we don't have that sound bite. So, that's right, we can just do that. Oh, OK. We do have it. Go play it.
ARROYO: Go ahead.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: What did you think of the service?
DOANLD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: What do you think? Did you like it? Did you find it exciting? Not too exciting, was it? I didn't think it was a good service, no. They can do much better.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That was understated, Raymond. That was understated for Trump. That was actually a cool kind of -- he threw in some shade, but like not the full Trump shade.
ARROYO: Yeah, that's not quite the Yelp review I think the National Cathedral was looking for, but boy did they get it. It's uncomfortable to put him there and his family in that position.
INGRAHAM: No, we don't want to elevate this anymore, but I thought that was so egregious, Raymond, and so out of touch. And I know a lot of denominations are struggling, not all, but some are struggling to put people in the pews.
ARROYO: Yeah, that one in particular.
INGRAHAM: I can't imagine the National Cathedral is attracting throngs of new worshipers with that kind of lecturing, OK. I don't think that's what people are looking for in faith today.
ARROYO: It's also -- it's a sour note at the end of a beautiful inaugural weekend that invoked the 80's and a triumphant ascendant America. Then you get this, you know, grumpy --
INGRAHAM: Throwback. It was like a throwback --
ARROYO: -- to the George Floyd march.
INGRAHAM: No, no, it was a throwback to the 70's. I felt like it was like I was in high school. It was like 1977. That's what it looked like to me. All right, Raymond, thank you for that. Sorry about the bumpy ride with the elements. All right, ahead, Trump making a big move to make America healthy, coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: The World Health Organization. Don't you see the importance of an organization like that to coordinate a global response?
DOANLD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Sure, I do, but not when you're being ripped off like we are by the World Health. World Health ripped us off. Everybody rips off the United States, and that's it. It's not going to happen anymore.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now, of course, Trump's right, and one of the WHO's priorities is to pass something called the Pandemic Treaty. Well, of course, that's a huge violation of U.S. sovereignty. One of the treaty's main goals will end up stifling free speech. Clearly, that's what they want to do because some of the early drafts tell you everything you need to know, requiring countries to identify and combat disinformation.
Yeah, so basically our whole show would be persona non grata during the pandemic when we talked about masks and the shot and mandates.
Joining me now is Dr. Peter McCullough, an internist and cardiologist. All right, Dr. McCullough, you and I would have not been anywhere, right? We wouldn't have been on television from February of 2020 through, what, 2022, under this draft of the pandemic treaty? Of course we shouldn't be there in this nonsense.
DR. PETER MCCULLOUGH, INTERNIST AND CARDIOLOGIST: The tipping point was that the global protests at the World Health Assembly last summer, the entire world is rejecting this international health regulations and pandemic treaty alliance.
INGRAHAM: Well, you know that people like Bill Gates are very serious about having global surveillance, and when they say surveillance they mean, you know, reporting of data and so forth. And on the surface that sounds like that would be fine, correct?
But when you get into disinformation and misinformation, I mean, given what Fauci was saying at the early stage of this pandemic with the wet market and masks and social distancing, I mean, all of that turned out to be disinformation.
MCCULLOUGH: We need bio-surveillance, but we need surveillance of biolabs that are creating gain of function dangerous pathogens. So not surveillance on one another. And I tell you, I think the response back from the WHO, to Trump said it all, in their letter, they said they've been working on accountability, transparency, and cost effectiveness for seven years. Well, Laura, they just got a 20 percent budget cut.
INGRAHAM: Well, People don't realize this, Dr. McCullough. But the WHO, just from the United States, and we're the biggest funder, $1.28 billion with a B, and their concern, Tedros is concerned, ahead of WHO, that we need health, quote, "equity." That's the main focus, too. What does that mean?
MCCULLOUGH: The WHO is a global money pit, is what it is. We have plenty of capabilities at the CDC. Our healthcare is not influenced at all by the WHO in the United States.
INGRAHAM: No, it's absolutely insane. Dr. McCullough, I haven't seen you in a long time. It was great to see you. Thank you for everything you've done on this subject.
All right, that's it for us tonight. Remember to follow me. Get on Instagram. All of the hijinks and the adventures of the inauguration time, three days, all there. Jesse Watters takes it next.
