BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: -- deals with bipartisan effort to help families of first responders who die or suffer permanent disability from service related cancers. Thank you for inviting us into your home tonight. A unique show tonight for Special Report, but we had you covered. Fair, balanced and still unafraid. The Ingraham Angle is now.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. As always, thank you for joining us. Just getting started. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody is coming in, and nobody is coming now because they know they're not going to be able to come in. So we've really stopped something that was very, very serious. But we have to get the bad ones out. We have many murderers, many very bad people in our country that they've allowed because of a ridiculous, actually stupid open border policy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: 956, that's the number of illegals, most with criminal records, who were deported by ICE just yesterday. In total, there have been 2370 arrests of border crashers since January 23rd. That's about an average of 592 a day. These were child molesters. These were gang bangers. These were drug and human traffickers and domestic abusers. Yes, there were rapists too.
Meet Edgar de la Cruz Manzo convicted child rapist and Mexican national arrested by ICE in Seattle on Saturday. And there are just cold blooded killers in the bunch too, like Cesar Augusto Polanco, who hails from the Dominican Republic and was just picked up in Boston a few days ago.
Now, seeing the deportation -- deportation flights begin, the troops on the border, the no nonsense Tom Homan doing what he does best, enforcing the law, protecting the homeland. This is all extremely positive. It has a phenomenal deterrent effect and anyone thinking of coming here at this point.
Now, one would think that keeping vicious criminals off the streets would be under controversial. How's that controversial? But singer, actress and skincare entrepreneur Selena Gomez, she's very upset.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SELENA GOMEZ, ACTRESS AND SINGER: I just want to say that I'm so sorry. All my people are getting attacked. The children, they don't understand. I'm so sorry. I wish I could do something, but I can't. I don't know what to do. I'll try everything I promise.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, she's really crying there. Well, she tried, until the fierce online backlash, and then Gomez deleted that insipid, weepy post. Notice she said, my people are getting attacked. One of my people. Is she an illegal alien committing crimes? Those aren't her people. Now, given that she's worth an estimated $1.3 billion, good for her, according to Bloomberg, I imagine Selena Gomez could establish homes for migrants in their home countries where they're actually citizens. But no, she apparently thinks that working people should be punished by having these illegals flood their communities.
And speaking of billionaires and even worse than Gomez caring about the -- not caring about the safety of the American people, is a governor not caring about the safety of the American people. Enter shameless deceiver Illinois's J.B. Pritzker.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): They're going after people who are law abiding, who are holding down jobs. Why are we going after them? These are not people who are causing problems in our country, and what we need is a path to citizenship for them. We also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Did he say protect people? What a farce. Chicago is already reeling from gang banger crime. They don't need any more problems. And raise your hand if you're tired of these rich politicians and CEOs and celebrities trotting out their immigration sob stories. I used to do this on my radio show years ago with complete with music. But every time enforcement has actually carried out or ramped up, it's always the valedictorian, it's always -- it's the same thing.
But first of all, if you are in the country illegally, and especially if you're a criminal, you are a deportable alien under U.S. law. And yes, the term alien is correct. Others here on phony claims of asylum, they are deportable as well, but just because wealthy Americans like cheap labor that doesn't change what's true.
Now Trump won, and he said this tonight when he was in Florida giving that speech to the Republicans. He won in large part because of his pledge to deport millions of illegals, and I mean millions, not thousands, millions. The explosion of the illegal population coast-to-coast has had hideously destructive effects on local communities, on their schools, on their health care budgets, and of course, the crime, including against children, as we've seen with recent horrors in Boston, where local authorities had released this freak into the community, and there are tens of thousands of other violent illegal alien criminals still loose across America.
And as far as the argument that garden variety illegal immigration is a victimless crime, you know what I say to that bull. Working families, first time job seekers, as usual, they suffer the most and also kids in school. Schools that are overloaded with ESL students, budgets are crunched.
Of course, wealthy Democrats, though, like J.B., like Gavin Newsom, with their multiple homes and their private jets, they float above the misery they're willing to inflict on you, but they ought to be very careful here, because interfering with the federal law enforcement operation is a crime. Listen closely to his state A.G., who parses his words very carefully.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KWAME RAOUL (D), ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL: I have no intent on interfering with legal immigration enforcement processes. State of Illinois that we have a Trust Act that says that local and state law enforcement resources cannot be used for such unless there's a federal criminal warrant. I'm going to stand by our Constitution. I'm going to stand by our state law.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: What the open borders uniparty did to America is, I'm sorry, it's treasonous. And until we remove all the threats to the homeland, we should have a pause on all immigration to the United States. We must get rid of this backlog. It is massive, in the tens of millions, and thousand a day is sadly, it's just a drop in the bucket. We need 10 times that number, which is possible if states and local officials actually cooperated. And you know what happens when America becomes as Teddy Roosevelt warned all those years ago, a polyglot boarding house.
Look at what went down in Dallas over the weekend.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CROWD: The people united will never be the (inaudible).
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: And we need not forget the NGOs and other groups that take in huge amounts of federal money to settle and help process illegal aliens, like the Catholic charities.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm an attorney at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and the Refugee and Immigration Services Program. This is a video about knowing your rights if Immigration and Customs Enforcement approaches you, if you are undocumented and immigration officers come to your workplace, be aware of the following. First, do not panic and do not run away. If you are questioned, you may tell them you want to remain silent. You can refuse to sign any or all paperwork until you've had the opportunity to speak to a lawyer.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: All the money has to be cut off to these groups. All of it. This money should be spent on American homeless individuals, drug addicted, vets on the streets, the elderly living alone, all of this, it's got to stop. Now, naturally CBS yesterday tried to pull the immigration sob story routine on Vice President J.D. Vance.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Trump, specifically those allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enter churches and to enter schools. Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school?
J.D. VANCE (R), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: As a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement that they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement. Let them talk about the children who have been sex trafficked because of the wide open border. If you had a violent murder in a school, of course, I want law enforcement --
BRENNAN: Of course.
VANCE: -- to go and get that person out.
BRENNAN: Of course.
VANCE: So what's the point of the question?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Enough with the immigration sob stories. There are just as many American difficulties out there because of the illegal immigrant crush. J.D. killed it in that interview. And don't you love how Democrats and their pals in the regime media have suddenly become fiscal hawks when it comes to the cost of deporting all the illegals that their policies allowed in.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They want to invest billions of dollars in mass deportation, which, by the way, will also drive up costs when we lose hard working immigrants that have been here for decades. Expect prices to go through the roof.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His plans to deport undocumented migrant workers and put tariffs on imports would likely drive up the cost to build more homes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These sorts of things are going to cost a lot of money. Going to need a lot of money to fund what he wants to do at the border, how he wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, yes, now they want to cut costs. Where were they four years ago? Now Tom Homan has the best response to all of this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM HOMAN, BORDER CZAR: There's consequences to enter the country illegally. If we don't show this consequences, you never can fix the border problems. Congress has a mandate to give us money we need. What price you put on national security? What price you put on all these young ladies have been raped and murdered and burned alive. What price you put on that? What price you put on Laken Riley's life? What price you put on national security?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: America needs to be America again. Immigration, the right kind, once we get our house in order, it's beautiful. People who love our country, our culture, our language, our flag, it's a beautiful thing, but divided loyalties are poisonous to our national purpose. But the Left, they want us at each other's throats. They love it. They love scenes like that in Dallas. Constant strife. They depend on it.
Remember Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals. It's all in there. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. Look, we're only a week in and so far so good. But with approximately 15 million illegals here, probably more. Tom Homan and the DHS will need to move with deliberate speed. They'll need to get creative. Everyone here illegally needs to return home so we can have peace in our home. And that's the Angle.
Joining us now is Vashon Tuncle, Chicago resident and activist and Joe Borelli, minority leader of the New York City Council. Vashon, Tom Homan's deportations in Chicago, you heard your governor and you've heard your mayor. They're really upset by this. They say, oh, we're going to -- we're not going to interfere, but --
VASHON TUNCLE, CHICAGO RESIDENT: But OK, I just want to say this. First thing I want to say is thank you, Tom Homan for doing an absolute great job, for cleaning up the city of Chicago. I know you're not done yet, and I have another thing to say to Brandon Johnson and J.B. Pritzker, how do you guys sleep at night knowing that there are rapists out here that committed these heinous crimes against the children and the women? How do you guys sleep at night knowing that we're half a billion dollars in debt when it comes to these illegals? How do these men sleep at night knowing that you're putting illegal immigrants that are committing crimes over the American citizens? I just can't believe that they're doing this.
INGRAHAM: Well, and Joe, each illegal immigrant in the United States, I got an illegal alien, immigrants are the people we welcome in because they want to be part of the national fabric. They want to contribute to the society. But Joe, they cost on average $8,000 a year in subsidies, health care, schooling, all the other vouchers they receive from various entities. So the idea that this is some -- this doesn't cost us anything. This costs us hundreds of billions of dollars.
JOE BORELLI, MINORITY LEADER, NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL: Yes, we have the receipts here in New York. So far, the migrant crisis has cost 6.5 billion with a B out of pocket. So if there's no other elected official in New York, maybe it's just me, but I want to say thank you to President Trump. Thank you to Tom Homan, because as a taxpayer in this city, I don't know how long we can possibly sustain this wave of illegal people living on our dime. I mean, thankfully, we have seen a reduction in the numbers thanks to some of the work that Trump has done on the border already. So we are closing some of our migrant shelters. But how do we get back that $6.5 billion that could have gone to schools, to hospitals, to nurses, to firefighters or even, you know, making the flowers in the park grow nicer? All these things were taken from us because the Democratic Party fundamentally failed us at the border and here in our large cities.
INGRAHAM: Well, Vashon, what's happening in places like Fairfax County, Virginia, which is right outside of D.C., it's very wealthy area, but the public schools have seen -- have seen a decrease in enrollment, COVID, but a lot of the politics in public schools, a lot of -- especially Christian parents have pulled their kids out. So the illegal influx of students is actually helpful to the teachers unions, a whole new generation to propagandize to, I guess. So that's also kind of an unholy alliance, along with Catholic charities, sadly, Lutheran services, all these other NGOs.
TUNCLE: So here's the thing, we have to just start putting Americans first. Like it's just as simple as that, and I believe Tom Homan is doing the right job when it comes to putting Americans first. And I just want to say this to all the criers out there who are crying over the undocumented immigrants who's been here for years and whatever like Selena Gomez, Tom Homan has already made this clear, if you are here illegally, you're not off the table. You are committing a crime within itself if you're here illegally in America.
INGRAHAM: I mean again, but they just want to like, say, oh, that doesn't matter. Well, that's why we have millions of people here, Joe, it does -- if they -- they told the world that if you come here illegally, you can stay indefinitely, they broadcast that to the world, and you in New York are suffering, and you in Chicago and Oakland and St. Louis and little towns across America, you're all suffering as a result, Joe.
BORELLI: Right, Tom Homan is fundamentally right. He talked about consequences as being the negative and being the reason people don't come, but the consequences when they're giving you free stuff and free health care and free schools and fundamentally, the life that many of them do hope for. Of course, more people are going to come. It doesn't take a genius to realize it. In fact, even Eric Adams tried to fly down to South America at one point during this crisis to try to convince people that this wasn't in their best interest. But until we stopped giving them basically everything they possibly need for free, they weren't going to stop coming. That changed when Donald Trump took office on day one, and I suspect it's going to get better from here on in.
INGRAHAM: Yes, there's a lot of people that have to be removed, and it's got to be a pace that is -- it's going to be hard to maintain, but we just have to do it that. Vashon, Joe, thank you so much.
All right, the president of the country at Colombia, not the university, apparently thought that America had no right to return the Colombian nationals living here illegally and refused to accept our repatriation flights. So in response, Trump immediately announced tariffs on Colombia, which set off the usual gas bags.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The only way that Donald Trump knows how to, quote, lead is by acting like a bully. That doesn't demonstrate anything other than incompetence.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That just seems like something that is a really bad idea.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This shows the hastiness of the policy Trump and Homan are implementing. You can't just bully your way onto a tarmac in a sovereign state.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: But they were wrong, of course, because using a strong hand against foolish leaders actually does work. Now, Colombia is crawling back to us, even sending the Foreign Minister and ambassador here to smooth things over. And yes, they will accept Colombians who return as deportees.
Joining us now, Kevin McCarthy, former Speaker of the House. Kevin, it's good to see you tonight. This is something to behold with the Left refusing to learn what just happened in the presidential election, and again, standing up for the illegals over the rights of Americans. It's unbelievable.
KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: It's unbelievable. What's so remarkable is, when are they going to learn what President Trump says he means. Not only did that flip, the Colombian President offered to send his own presidential plane to start picking them up, to bring them back.
INGRAHAM: Good.
MCCARTHY: That is the strength of what President Trump was able to handle. And it was only like in a six hour time period, but it also sent a message to everybody else across the world, you're not going to treat America that way. And what's so unique, when you look back at this, remember Joe Biden saying he needed the tools to protect the border. He's the one that broke it, and you're watching what Tom and President Trump is doing. They are protecting that border, but now they're removing criminals, and the Democrats are complaining about rapists leaving that are illegal aliens sitting here.
INGRAHAM: And Pete Hegseth has now said, of course, confirmed as the Secretary of Defense, has said that the military will be at the disposal of U.S. authorities if needed. And obviously it is needed right now, once President Trump declared these cartels to be foreign terrorist organizations that freed the military up to be able to take that active role. I think most Americans are much more in favor of the U.S. military helping us, then sadly, a lot of these foreign adventures that just haven't worked out too well.
MCCARTHY: They need to help us, I'd tell you, America needs to learn what's happening down on that southern border, especially with these cartels. These cartels have weaponry like a military. The Sinaloa Cartel in Arizona, you cannot cross that border without paying them. They will pick you up and kill you. They will string you up. They burn individuals. You'll also find when they cross the border, they're wearing camouflage. They've got carpets under their shoes because they don't want to get caught. But those cartels have become so powerful and so wealthy by moving illegals up to, from 160 other countries. Wait till they start finding the individuals that came from China into America through here. What type of pods within there.
We need the military there to set a very strong tone that we're not going to allow this. And Mexico can't control their own cartels. They're more powerful than their military.
INGRAHAM: Mr. Speaker, don't you think if in the future, one of these countries says we're not going to accept these hardened criminals? I mean, we do have Gitmo. Gitmo used to, you know, before the enemy combatants, Gitmo held Haitian refugees initially. So Gitmo is available, we could use Gitmo if necessary. I mean, honestly, then you don't have to deal with the court system here. That's why Gitmo was set up.
MCCARTHY: Exactly. But remember, the executive order that Barack Obama, he was going to close Gitmo, but it was a Republican majority that was able to keep it open. But this is the individuals that we should be sending people down there to and sending a very clear message that if you want to come to America, come here legally, where we are country of immigrants, but legal immigration, and don't send the criminals into America, because we'll send them back.
INGRAHAM: Got to go home. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Ahead, Trump drops a bomb on DEI in the military.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Now it's a little wishful thinking here. DEI isn't DOA just yet, because race hustlers like Al Sharpton are on the scene.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
AL SHARPTON, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Corporations came forward and said, we're want to do diversity. We're going to do this because racism needs to be dealt with. And for Donald Trump to be able to cancel the commitment they made is an outright front to the black community, brown community, LGBTQ and gay community. That is why we will stand with those that stand with us. Costco's immediately stepped out and said that they will not crack on DEI. Today, we are calling a buy-in.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Sharpton, and the few who still follow him, they're back to their old shakedown, demanding that companies embrace their racial vision, or else.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SHARPTON: People that do not stand with us, let Donald Trump stop us in 90 days from boycotting there. We will not pay to be rejected and disrespected.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: But what is there to boycott here? The end of racial discrimination in hiring is exactly what ending DEI does. People of all races voted against this DEI divisiveness and Sharpton; he's not paying attention to the facts though. They're too inconvenient for his narrative supported by his comrade of Left-wing media ideologues.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The majority of white people voted for this. This is the disgusting version of America that people want. And oh, by the way, eggs are still more expensive, so you even get that, great job white folks. DEI is a policy invented by white folks who try to stop other white folks from being racist. If they want to end the policy, the next media question shouldn't be like, oh, my God, you're ending DEI, the next media question should be OK, so what are you doing to combat racism and employment and hiring?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining us now, I'm delighted he is with us, Josh Hawley, of course, the great Senator from -- wait, no, well, there you are Josh. Hawley, I'm sorry we're not sure you were with us. Senator Hawley, thank you so much for joining us. This DEI madness, and I know Missouri has been grappling with some of this over the years as well, but the DEI madness has actually, or had actually infected our military and Pete Hegseth is having none of this, taking his orders from Donald Trump. But the Left, they are going crazy, insisting that this is causing people to have hurt feelings, lose job opportunities, and the trans crowd is very, very upset.
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Well, he's doing exactly the right thing, Laura, I'm so glad to see him doing it. And listen, DEI, let's just speak the truth here. DEI is unconstitutional. What did the Supreme Court say just a year or two ago? You couldn't use race as the basis in college admissions now, if not college admissions, why the United States military? Here's the other truth, Laura, DEI is what the elites use to stay in power, because they use it to divide working people. They try to turn whites against blacks and blacks against whites, and Hispanics against everybody else. It's their way to maintain their power. That's what they want. That's who invented DEI, the elites, and they are scared to death now that what's going to happen is everyday people, working people across this country are going to unite, and they're going to say, we're going to take our country back.
INGRAHAM: Now, Senator Hawley, of course, as I noted, the Left is going crazy or at least pretending to. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There seems to be an element of glee and sort of traumatizing people, this DEI leave is just another example of kind of cruelty and pettiness.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We as a country strive to create a more equitable space for everyone.
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Diversity, equity and inclusion are American values. These are values that everybody in this country should embrace.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: No, no, no, no, wrong. This is cruel and petty, Senator? Isn't it cruel to say because you're not the preferred skin color for this job, don't even apply. Isn't that what DEI does?
HAWLEY: Yes, it's not only cruel. I mean, it's unconstitutional and it ought to be illegal. We ought to make it absolutely illegal in law. Nobody should be relying on skin color in order to hire or fire. But what I just heard, Laura in those clips you display, what I see, there are people who are desperately afraid, they are losing their power.
It's people who look out at the electorate, and they look at Donald Trump's gains with Hispanic voters and with African-American voters and they say, whoa, this can't happen. Why is this happening? No, we've got to get back to the old lines and the old religion of DEI.
What they're seeing is working people are saying, we're not going to fall for that anymore. We're not going to fall for identity politics anymore. We're going to unite around love of country, unite around our shared interests, and they're going to take back power from the elite. And that's why those folks that you just played, that's why they're so hysterical.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah, you're right. People of color, women, young, old, all coming to see the pragmatism of Trump's policies. It doesn't matter what your skin color is. You want to make a decent living in this country and be safe. You hit the nail on the head, Senator. Thank you so much.
All right, liberals, of course, trying to smear RFK Jr. Just saw him in the airport last week before his confirmation hearing. Again, you can almost smell the desperation. Next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: All right, this will be fun. RFK Jr.'s confirmation hearing to head up HHS will start in about 48 hours. But of course, the left is hyperventilating over his goal. It's just to make America healthy again.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: He does not listen or look at the proven science. He does not listen or look to the experts in the field, but he has found his own experts to listen to. And has very, very pronounced views on a wide variety of issues, which are just out of step with, I think, the mainstream of the scientific community.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I hardly recognized her. That's Kathleen Sebelius. Does that name ring a bell? She was the failed HHS secretary under Obama. And she's also worried about Trump's withdrawal from the WHO.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: I'm afraid what it will be is the World Health Organization. If the United States withdraws, it may well collapse. And what that does is not just make Americans far less safe and secure, but it really sends ripples throughout the world in terms of not being able to detect and prevent and restrain diseases at a very early stage, not being able to share information.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh my God. I just fell asleep. I'm sorry, that's so boring. Now, this comes from the same woman who oversaw the failed launch of the Obamacare website. Do you remember that? Now, remember when no one could access it. Well, no one can access what she's saying now. It took them three years to figure that out.
Now, left is upset because most of all, Trump is doing what he promised to do, fix large parts of our government, frankly all of it. Joining me now, Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, NYU Langone Professor of Medicine. Dr. Siegel, your response to Kathleen Sebelius if you didn't fall asleep, like I almost did.
DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, I was thinking of the irony here which kept me awake. Listen to what she did under Obama. She brought in Obamacare, as you mentioned, the failed websites. But how about the fact that it extended the sick care system, where more and more people got coverage which didn't give them care.
And it was, let's make everybody sick so the insurance companies are happy, and then we'll cover it and we'll pump you full of pharmaceuticals and you'll get heavier and heavier. You know, you'll drink more alcohol, obesity epidemic. All of the things that RFK Jr. and President Trump under Make America Healthy Again are trying to reverse.
In other words, it's before you ever get to the doctor's office that you want to have clean food that's not full of chemicals, that isn't full of red dye, that isn't full of things that make you obese, which then leads to the very health problems that I have to see in the office all the time.
High blood pressure, diabetes, dementia, sleep apnea, even cancer. And guess what? Obamacare is promising to cover that. So how dare she come forward now after her system increased the federal spending in this situation to about a trillion and a half dollars now with Medicare and Medicaid alone. Of all people to be spokesperson here.
INGRAHAM: Well, now the CIA on another topic, Dr. Siegel, is agreeing with the theory, it seems, indicating that they kind of agree the theory that COVID-19 did come from a lab leak. We were saying that in 2020. So now they're joining the FBI and Department of Energy in supporting the lab leak theory.
Now, doctor, how significant is this and what took them so long?
SIEGEL: This is huge. Because the CIA is the agency we really want to listen to about what's happening on foreign soil, what's being kept from us, what's being hidden, what's being suppressed. I remember in early 2020 when Tom Cotton, who's now the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee where he belongs, was being ridiculed, mocked.
But we were covering him on TV here, Laura, you were, I was, and we took him very seriously while Tony Fauci and others were suppressing the lab leak theory. But look at all the evidence for it. Where did this virus come from? How come it suddenly start spreading wildly? What happens in that lab where there are safety problems? How come people were getting sick in the lab and being sent to hospitals in the summer of 2019? How come we didn't hear about any of this?
How come, and this is the part that involves the WHO, the WHO was saying China bought the world time, and China, it was only a regional problem only. So, no wonder President Trump is saying, because he's after all a great businessman, how some China is paying $38 million and we're paying $500 million to an agency, the political top of that agency is busy carrying water for China and helping them suppress emerging pandemics.
He's basically shaking the stick at them and saying, you are not helping America, why should I pay for you?
INGRAHAM: Well, when you think of the billions we spend on the CIA budget, the billions and billions, and we're just hearing that they now favor the lab leak? I mean, that's just a total indictment of the CIA. I mean, we knew it was a lab leak and they're just telling us now. We're supposed to applaud the CIA. It's a complete embarrassment.
SIEGEL: A quick point on that. The Biden-CIA hit it. They knew it. It took John Ratcliffe to come forward and get it to be revealed. This information was being suppressed by the Biden-CIA, which is a disgrace. And we all know what else they hit, which is President Biden's mental status, etcetera.
INGRAHAM: Well, turn over all the rocks and you'll see all the little creatures crawl out. Doctor, thank you so much. All right, the massive cultural shift that's going on is also a point of great consternation to the left. On both coasts. Jillian Michaels is here next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(CROWD CHANTING "USA")
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I have friends that were there, and they were completely just blown away by Trump just showing up. They didn't know. People there did not know. The Secret Service kind of showed up. But of course, we know Joe Biden could never pull that off. Well, he'd stag through maybe. Stagger, kind of, which, where's the exit? But look, few people could.
But I think it's another sign that things are changing. Look, we know Donald Trump is the best retail politician of our time, no doubt about that. He's better than Obama, better than Clinton. I don't think anyone really comes close, at least in this day and age.
But something else is going on. And you saw it when he was sitting with the city council members and Karen Bass and with Gavin Newsom, that Trump has made conservatism cool again. Yeah.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: The man was impeached twice. He was convicted on 34 felony counts. And the American people still said, he's closer to normal than what we see left.
UNKNOWN: Exactly.
UNKNOWN: You're talking about the issues that pertain to less than 1 percent of the population. The Democratic Party came, of course, as if that was a priority more so than the other issues. What voter out there can look at the Democratic Party at this moment in time and say, there's a voice for us, somebody that speaks for us, that goes up on Capitol Hill and fights the fights that we want them fighting on our behalf. They didn't do that. And that's why their behinds are home, and that man is back into the White House.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Hakeem Jeffries should sit down with him. Joining me now, Jillian Michaels, health and wellness expert. Jillian, what's going on here? How did this cultural shift? And again, it's not complete, but without a doubt. Like I see people landing in LaGuardia Airport with the MAGA hats on. Now, I don't even bat an eye.
JILLIAN MICHAELS, HEALTH AND WELLNESS EXPERT: It's definitely a significant shift. And just yesterday, my teenage son looked at me and said, mom, being Republican is punk rock. My jaw hit the ground and I was like, buddy, what would make you say that? You know, because I like to think of myself as issue by issue, you know, person by person and take things one case at a time.
But my son literally looked at me and he said, well, it's anti- establishment. It's people over profit. And I do appreciate the fact that Donald Trump is pro-business. But there is a trickle, an element to that is for the people. The right is now the free speech party and the left is associated with censorship. The right is building a more diverse coalition and the left is canceling and purging people who don't agree with them.
The left has ceded the mantle of health which was always, traditionally, a left-wing, like, crunchy granola West Coast thing, and now the right is taking it head-on. It's issues like this that have brought people from the left, or the center, over to center-right.
INGRAHAM: And Jillian, I think this issue of authenticity, we hear that word bandied about quite a bit, who's authentic, who's not. And he comes across as authentic, whether you agree with him or not. But in this exchange that he had with Karen Bass on Friday, you saw authentic Trump, watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: We could get people back building as fast as possible. And we're going to continue doing that.
DOANLD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The one thing is, they are saying they will not be allowed to start for 18 months.
UNKNOWN: No, that will not be the case.
TRUMP: OK, I just hope you're right.
UNKNOWN: You can hold me to it.
TRUMP: Four groups said that.
UNKNOWN: No.
TRUMP: That would be -- they should be able to do it. They should be able to start tonight. You have emergency powers just like I do and I'm exercising my emergency powers. You have to exercise them also.
UNKNOWN: I did exercise them.
TRUMP: I mean, look, you have a very powerful emergency power and you can do everything within 24 hours.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Yeah, authentic Trump hits L.A. And, Julian, that was like a normal conversation that you'd have with anybody in this same situation, yet he has the experience of actually building large projects. So, he knows what the Coastal Commission is all about. He knows the pitfalls and the hurdles that, in this case, have to be cleared quickly.
MICHAELS: Well, Trump, I think, he's actually not a politician. Even though he is the President of the United States, that's what's so appealing about him is that he's a businessman. He is not there to say the right things and massage egos and be politically correct. He's there to get stuff done. And what you see is what you get.
And even though there are times I don't like some of the things he does or I don't agree with some of the things that he says, at least I know what I'm getting. At least you know you can trust what he's saying, because he really doesn't care what anyone thinks. And there's just something reassuring about that for people. The authenticity factor is irrefutable with him.
INGRAHAM: Well, and you can't imagine -- I mean, obviously, Joe Biden could never have done anything like that. I mean, that's just, it's like obvious, we shouldn't even say it anymore. But Jillian, we love having you on. Thank you so much for joining us.
All right, up next, liberals, all of a sudden, they're caring about dollars and cents. How much are we spending? Inflation. Wow, that's a change. Next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: All right. For years the press, you know, they peddled this narrative on the economy, that Bidenomics was working, they told us don't worry, the rise in grocery prices, inflation, none of it. But now that Trump's been in office for one week, suddenly the economy is a real concern.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: You campaigned on lowering prices. We've seen all of these executive orders. Which one lowers prices?
J.D. VANCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: And there have been a number of executive orders that have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices. If you look at our slate of executive orders -- no, Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it's going to take a little bit of time, right? The president has been president for all of five days. I think that in those five days, he's accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now, Ari Fleischer, Fox News contributor, former White House press secretary. So, Ari, four years of Biden had some of the worst inflation we've had in decades. We know what's happened with the price of food. But Trump was supposed to fix it all, that they said wasn't a problem, in a week.
ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, you know, the velocity of that question, let's talk about that for a second. I remember when Barack Obama went through his transition, and the Washington Post sent a reporter to watch him on vacation in Hawaii, and the reporter wrote about President-elect Obama's chiseled pectoral muscles.
This is what you get when the press is in full-fawn to the left, and then you get a guy like Trump coming in and they go into full and high dungeon asking a ridiculous question like that as if it was supposed to have been accomplished in five days.
But the real answer is he's going to accomplish it, first off, because of one phone call. His first phone call to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, just watch, Laura, they're going to increase oil production, the price of energy is going to come down. That's what J.D. Vance was talking about. Biggest driver of cost is energy.
INGRAHAM: No, Ari, it's just the whole thing is just happening so fast. I think people can't keep up with the news cycle. Scott Bessent confirmed today, he's going to be a terrific Treasury Secretary. He floated the idea, as did Trump, he came close to it, of getting rid of the income tax altogether, and having something closer to a consumption tax. That was today.
I mean, really quickly, Ari, 10 seconds, how exciting is this time?
FLEISCHER: Oh, this is huge, Laura. I mean, I think a lot of it is over the top. I mean, I don't think they're going to be able to just abolish the income tax like that, especially with a one vote margin in the House. But this is what we've been waiting for.
INGRAHAM: And it's going to be fun to watch and have you with us. Ari, as always, thank you. All right. That's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on Instagram. A lot of new videos up there. Jesse Watters, he takes it from here.
