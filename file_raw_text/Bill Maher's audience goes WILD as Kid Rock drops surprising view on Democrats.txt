Bill Maher's audience erupted in applause after his guest Kid Rock proclaimed his backing band was one of the most diverse, and void of 'DEI s***.'
Rock, real name Robert James Ritchie, appeared alongside Maher on his show 'Real Time with Bill Maher', on Friday night.
Maher asked the 54-year-old about his 2022 song 'My Kind of Country' which includes the lines 'My kind of country has a Trump and a JFK, an NAACP and a NRA.'
Rock, a Trump supporter, interjected saying had he known Robert F. Kennedy Jr was to be part of Trump's administration in 2022 he would have changed the lyric to RFK.
The comedian asked him if RFK was the last Democrat he liked, to which he said: 'My whole business is Democrats so to speak. 
'That's the world I've operated for years, half my band is liberal, gay, or black. I have one of the most diverse bands out there, not because of this DEI s***.
'Just because they are the best at what they do, we all love each other and get along', prompting a round of applause from Maher's audience. 
Maher questioned the star about performing at the Trump inauguration, to which he responded that he also played at the inauguration of President Barack Obama. 
Rock added: 'I didn't vote for him, I played for him at the Kennedy Center. Everybody's just gotta calm the f*** down a little bit.'
In the same show, Rock had chimed in on the decision by the Boy Scouts of America to change their name to Scouting America to promote inclusion.
Maher said: 'The whole f****** country is an Onion headline, the Boy Scouts of America cannot be called Boy Scouts anymore because it's exclusionary.
'Like there isn't a girl scouts, like this is some crime against nature. People are different, it's now Scouting America.'
Rock said: 'Sorry to put it so harsh but we lost a good portion of a few generations of men who just turned into complete f***ing p***ies.' 
His appearance on Maher's show comes after Rock abruptly ended his performance inside Jon Bon Jovi's bar in Nashville last week. 
Seemingly frustrated with the audience's lack of participation, he stormed off the stage while attending Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan's birthday. 
He became irate while singing a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's Proud Mary, as the crowd failed to clap like he had asked them to.
He stopped the performance mid song, as seen in footage shared on YouTube, and told the female singer of the band, which also included Bryan himself, 'F**k them. F**k them. Hey, hey, stop.' 
Rock then demonstrated how he wanted the crowd to clap, telling them, 'If you ain't gonna clap, we ain't gonna sing. That's how it's gonna go.'
A few people clapped briefly, but it wasn't enough for the All Summer Long hitmaker, as he stormed off the stage. 
He then told the audience, 'You know what, f**k y'all. You ain't gonna clap, I'm gone.'
Rock is next set to hit the stage in April for his Rock the Country co-headlining tour with Nickelback.
