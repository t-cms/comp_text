Key Facts
Amemosent by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to all federal agencies offered guidance on enacting Trump s executive order to dismantle federal diversity efforts.
It directs the heads of federal agencies and departments to place all staffers overseeing DEI efforts on administrative paid leave by 5 p.m. on Wednesday and lay out plans for staff reductions by Jan. 31.
The agencies and departments have also been ordered to take down any websites and social media accounts by the Wednesday evening deadline.
The memo also orders the immediate withdrawal of any  pending documents, directives, orders, materials, and equity plans  regarding DEI in the federal workforce and the cancellation of related training initiatives.
By Thursday, the federal agencies will be required to share a complete list of all diversity-related offices and employees who were staffed in those offices as of Election Day (November 5) and all DEI-related agency contracts.
The memo also orders the agencies to share a list of all  contract descriptions or personnel position descriptions  that were changed since election day to  obscure their connection to DEIA programs.

What Are The Agency Staffers Being Told?
Agency heads will need to send a notice informing all employees in the agency about the changes. The OPM has provided a template for wording the notice, which informs all employees about the move to close  all agency DEIA offices and end all DEIA-related contracts.  The notice adds that:  These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination.  The staffers will also be informed that the Trump administration is  aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language,  and urged to report this within 10 days. The notice ends by saying there will be no repercussions  for timely reporting this information,  but warns that not doing so could  result in adverse consequences. 
Key Background
Shortly after taking office on Monday, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders, among them one titled  Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.  The order called for the elimination of federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, calling them  illegal and immoral discrimination programs.  The order also attacked the  infiltration  of the federal government with DEI programs and directed federal agencies to stop considering diversity during its hiring process. The president and his allies have attacked DEI programs, claiming they are discriminatory and in his inaugural speech, Trump said he would end  the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.
