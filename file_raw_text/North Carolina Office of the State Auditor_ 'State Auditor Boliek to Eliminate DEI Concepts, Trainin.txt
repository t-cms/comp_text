Today, State Auditor Dave Boliek announced his intentions to strike "Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion" (DEI) from internal policies at the North Carolina Office of the State Auditor.
The move follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to eliminate DEI in the federal workforce and the decision by Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to remove DEI from the North Carolina Department of Labor's performance evaluations.
"DEI is divisive and brings little-to-no return on investment of time and resources. My goal in the Auditor's Office is to establish a professional workplace where individuals are valued and measured based on merit. Corporations across the country are abandoning DEI, as are colleges and universities, and it's time for the government to do the same," said State Auditor Boliek.
The negative effects of DEI are backed by years of research and studies. A recent report by researchers at Rutgers University's Social Perception Lab and the Network Contagion Research Institute found that DEI can heighten racial suspicion, prejudicial attitudes, and authoritarian policing. As part of a comprehensive internal review, DEI will be eliminated from internal policies at the Office of the State Auditor, including any training, performance requirements, preferencing, and directives.
