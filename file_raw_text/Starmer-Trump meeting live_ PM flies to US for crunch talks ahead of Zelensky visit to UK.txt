Sir Keir Starmer is heading to Washington DC after pledging to  to help sway Donald Trump to back security in Europe and maintain support for Ukraine. 
Kyiv and allies are scrambling to respond after President Trump spoke to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, on ending the war. Sir Keir's visit to the White House on Thursday is part of European efforts to ensure Kyiv gets a voice in negotiations.
Ukraine's President Zelensky is set to join a meeting the PM is hosting on Sunday in London for European leaders.
Earlier, Sir Keir declined to say whether money for a deal with the
He told the Commons the increase was for "our capability on defence" and that the controversial deal with Mauritius as "extremely important" for the nation's security. 
The Institute for Fiscal Studies accused ministers of playing "silly games with numbers" after Sir Keir suggested £13.4bn more would be spent by including   numbers for the financial year 2027-28.  
However, defence secretary John Healey suggested the real-terms increase "would be something over £6 billion".

Cabinet united over cutting aid to boost defence, Rayner insists
16:38
Angela Rayner has said the Cabinet is united in its decision to increase defence spending while cutting the UK's aid budget.
The Deputy Prime Minister said: "No-one could have predicted the situation we are in in Europe at the moment, and, of course, it was absolutely right that the Prime Minister said that we had to increase defence spending because the number one responsibility of any government is to keep people safe.
"It is devastating that we've had to reduce the overseas aid budget, but we had to set a balanced budget. 
"We understand the economy was in a very difficult position after 14 years of the Tories, and we've taken the decisive action to protect our country and to make sure that the economy is in a strong position, so that going forward we can increase the budget for overseas aid as the money becomes available.
"The Cabinet had a discussion on it and we were all united that the number one responsibility of any government is to keep its citizens safe."
Russia accuses UK and France of 'heating up' Ukraine war amid defence push

The UK and France are "heating up the conflict" in Ukraine rather than seeking peace, Russia has suggested as Sir Keir Starmer travels to the US for crunch talks with Donald Trump.
The Prime Minister also hit back against accusations the Government was playing "silly games" over the amount of extra funding which will be raised for Britain's defence.
Sir Keir announced the extra funding in response to "tyrant" Russian President Vladimir Putin and ongoing uncertainty over the US's commitment to European security, although it comes at the expense of cuts to the UK's aid budget.
Speaking during a visit to Qatar, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed European nations, including the UK, were now seeking to prolong the war in Ukraine.
"The approach that is being imposed by the Europeans, first of all France and the British, is aimed... at heating up the conflict further and stopping any attempts to calm it down," he said, according to a translation from Russia's state news agency, Tass.

Lib Dems accuse Tories of 'scaremongering' over pint under threat claims

Holly Evans
Daisy Cooper, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said the Tories' claim that the pint is under threat is "scaremongering" and "total nonsense".
She told MPs: "What on earth is this absurd idea in the Opposition day motion that the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill will somehow put the British pint under threat?
"The pint is well and truly safe, something that I'm sure this entire House wants to hear. The pint is enshrined in law, in the Weights and Measures Act, so this scaremongering is just total nonsense. I would be tempted to call it a load of old codswallop but I would not want to insult the makers of that very fine pale ale.
"I could instead accuse them of scraping the barrel but let us just say that the Conservatives' claim that the pint will be abolished is as fanciful as Labour's claim that punters will see a penny taken off the price of their pint. They won't. Frankly, if the Opposition think that they are standing up for pubs, they need to think again."

British firms not swayed by US push to scrap diversity goals, says minister

Holly Evans
The UK's employment rights minister has said he does not expect British businesses to follow the lead of US rivals scrapping diversity goals despite concerns following Donald Trump's presidency in the US.
Labour MP Justin Madders said UK firms have their "own approach" to equality, amid pressure from the American government to scale back initiatives.
"There's obviously an extra level of dialogue going on in terms of internal company discussions but I think the commitment and the benefits are very clearly laid out and I don't see UK companies going down that road," he said. 
Several large businesses in the US, including Google, Meta, Amazon and McDonald's, have scaled back their diversity programmes following Mr Trump's presidential election victory.
Mr Trump signed a flurry of executive orders after being sworn in last month, including dialling back transgender protections and ending federal government diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.
But on Tuesday, Apple shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the technology giant to join Mr Trump's push to abandon programmes designed to diversify workforces.

Badenoch suggests 'cover-up' of Chagos money deal

Speaking after Prime Minister's Questions, a spokesman for Mrs Badenoch said: "I think this all points to what amounts to really a cover-up of where this money for the Chagos surrender is coming from.
"It is incumbent on the Government as soon as possible to come and explain where the money is coming from, and if it is coming from the defence budget it makes all of the announcements over the last 24 hours seem (to be) ringing increasingly hollow."
On Tuesday a Conservative former defence minister suggested that money earmarked for the Chagos deal could instead be spent on the armed forces.
Andrew Murrison asked the Prime Minister: "Will he look at other things that perhaps present easier choices, and in particular, his choice to spend billions of pounds on Mauritius? And will he repurpose that money in defence of our armed forces?"
Starmer declines to say whether defence spending increase includes Chagos cash

Sir Keir Starmer has declined to say whether money for a deal with the Chagos Islands would come out of the increase in defence spending.
The Prime Minister told the Commons that the increase to 2.5% of GDP announced on Tuesday is for "our capability on defence and security in Europe", and described the deal being negotiated with Mauritius as "extremely important for our security".
The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory, but leasing back the strategically important Diego Garcia military base which is used by the US.
The Conservatives have called on ministers to explain as soon as possible if money for the deal will come out of the uplift announced on Tuesday.
Earlier on Wednesday, Defence Secretary John Healey did not say whether the Chagos money was included when asked, and the issue was pressed by Kemi Badenoch at Prime Minister's Questions.

Dominic Cummings has called for voters to back Nigel Farage's Reform UK in the May local elections. The former Boris Johnson aide did not say who he would vote for if there was an imminent general election. 
But, amid a furious backlash at Labour's policies so far, he said everyone should back Mr Farage's party in May.
Asked who he would vote for in a national election, Mr Cummings said: "Dunno yet, but obviously everyone should vote Reform this spring, no downsides, just upsides."
A mass Reform vote, with the party surging in the polls, would pile major pressure on Sir Keir Starmer while helping Mr Farage paint his party as the real opposition to Labour.

Investigations will be launched into seven organisations criticised in the Grenfell Tower Inquiry report, with the potential they could be banned from public contracts in future.
They are: Arconic Architectural Products SAS; Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK Limited which previously owned Celotex Limited; Exova (UK) Limited; Harley Facades Limited; Kingspan Insulation Limited; Rydon Maintenance Limited; and Studio E Architects Limited.
Cabinet Office parliamentary secretary Georgia Gould said the firms would be investigated under new debarment powers in the Procurement Act 2023, which came into effect on Monday.
She said: "These investigations will establish whether the organisations have engaged in professional misconduct for the purposes of that Act."
The organisations will be notified when an investigation is opened, she said, adding that investigations into other organisations could also take place.

Angela Rayner, who is also Housing Secretary, said: "We are acting on all of the inquiry's findings, and today set out our full response, detailing the tough action we are taking to drive change and reform the system to ensure no community will ever have to face a tragedy like Grenfell ever again.
"That means greater accountability, stronger regulation, and putting residents at the heart of decision-making.
"We must deliver the fundamental change required. We owe that to the Grenfell community, to the country, and to the memory of those who lost their lives."
Grenfell Next of Kin, a group representing some of the bereaved, said it will be "paying close attention to these words and intentions" from Government, as it repeated criticism of the "grave mistakes, failures, corruption" it said had led to the deaths.
The group: "We can never forget our beloved kin and we can never forgive the negligence and corruption that led to their deaths.
"The injustice is so great and the measures being put in place now with new laws and reforms are welcomed, but should have been basic requirements for a developed country such as ours.

She also added that to her "disgust and their shame", several of those companies involved had shown "little remorse" and had failed to rectify the issues in the construction of the tower.

"NATO's strength comes from the US and European partners and others working together and that is absolutely the focus of my work at the moment."

"And I want to strengthen our already strong relationship with the US, because I think it's vital that we do so.

Diane Abbott rebukes Keir Starmer over aid cut

Sir Keir Starmer has once again come under attack from Diane Abbott, this time over his decision to fund a defence spending increase by cutting aid to some of the world's poorest people.
The veteran left-winger said the "whole country stands behind the people of Ukraine", but added that "taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe".
"The desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter," Ms Abbott added.
It comes after a fierce power struggle between the two before the general election, in which senior Labour figures attempted to force Ms Abbott out of the party, which she eventually won. Sir Keir responded by saying he is proud of what Britain has done on international aid in the past, and he did not take the decision to cut it lightly.
He also promised to return to higher levels of aid spending in future.

The Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington told the Commons: "The whole country stands behind people of Ukraine but there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armament and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe, because the desperation and the poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and developed money is meant to counter."
Sir Keir Starmer responded: "It's not a decision I took lightly or wanted to take but at this point it's important we put defence and security spending for this country at the uppermost importance." 
He stressed that he hoped the Labour government would be able to return to investing in overseas aid in the future.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said a short break in hostilities in Ukraine rather than sustained and lasting peace would be "the worst of all outcomes".
Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the Commons: "We are still not clear where the money is coming from. We want to support him. He's also said that we should put British troops on the ground in Ukraine. We haven't seen the detail of any proposals. Would his new spending plans allow him to fund this commitment effectively?"
Sir Keir replied: "I think it's the same question again - it's £13.4 billion, that's the difference between this year and 2027/28.
"She asks a serious question about the security guarantees in Ukraine, and that is extremely important because the worst of all outcomes - if there's to be a cessation of hostilities - is that it is a short break rather than sustained and lasting peace.
"And I think that that means there's got to be security guarantees. I've indicated that we will play our full part. There has to be US backing, because otherwise I don't think it will deter (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.
"We are working on that. I am having extensive discussions about it. I'm not in a position to put details before the House, as she well knows, today but I'll continue down that route because I want a lasting peace in Ukraine and Europe for the safety and security of Ukrainians, of Europeans and of course, for everybody in this country."

This comes as Mr Trump moves further away from Europe amid his calls for the continent to take more responsibility for security issues, as US diplomats prepare to meet with Russian officials. 
The prime minister stressed that the UK and US have a "special deep relationship" with a shared interest in security, defence and intelligence issues. 
He added: "We also work with our European allies and it is that ability to work with the us and European allies that holds the peace and will hold the peace for many years to come."

Sir Keir Starmer has repeatedly refused to set out how much his deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius will cost.
He now finds himself in a difficult position, with Conservatives claiming much of his uplift in defence spending will actually be accounted for by the deal to leaseback a key UK-US military base in the archipelago.
Sir Keir was twice unable at PMQs to say that none of the uplift in defence spending was made up by the Chagos Islands deal, leaving an open flank for the Tories to attack him after an otherwise well-received announcement.
As long as Sir Keir refuses to set out how much the deal will cost, he leaves Labour open to attack as what he calls "wild off the mark" figures fill the void.  
Analysis: Kemi Badenoch's attempt at statesmanship falls flat

Kemi Badenoch has made an unexpected attempt at statesmanship during this week's PMQs, telling the Commons she and Sir Keir Starmer are "completely united" in their support for Ukraine, as well as wishing the PM "every success" on his visit to Washington DC for talks with Donald Trump.
It mirrors the position Sir Keir took when he was leader of the opposition, choosing not to challenge Rishi Sunak's government on issues of national security. 
Perhaps the change in tactic was sparked by her last performance at PMQs, which was so poor it left senior figures in the party feeling extremely rattled about her ability to hang on as leader.
But her latest attempt at civility is not a muscle Kemi Badenoch flexes often, and was quickly rebuffed by Sir Keir who shortly after accused the Tory leader of being on a "desperate search for relevance" - as well as mocking her for being the self-appointed "saviour of Western civilization".

 Sir Keir Starmer has taken the gloves off with Kemi Badenoch, launching an unusually brutal attack on the leader of the opposition.
The prime minister responded to Ms Badenoch's attempt to claim credit for the defence spending increase, accusing her of "appointing herself the saviour of Western civilisation".
"She didn't feature in my thinking at all," the PM said, eschewing a more conciliatory or diplomatic response."I was so busy at the weekend, I didn't even see her proposal," the Tory leader added.
He then repeatedly mocked Ms Badenoch for asking the same question - about his muddled defence spending figures - multiple times.

Questions raised over defence spending figure

Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said on Tuesday that ministers were playing "silly games with numbers" and had provided "totally inconsistent figures" measured against different benchmarks.
The think tank's associate director, Ben Zaranko, had earlier suggested the increase in spending would amount to around £6 billion, rather than the £13.4 billion the PM had indicated.
Mr Zaranko said: "As a minor note to what is a major announcement, the Prime Minister followed in the steps of the last government by announcing a misleadingly large figure for the 'extra' defence spending this announcement entails.
"An extra 0.2 per cent of GDP is around £6 billion, and this is the size of the cut to the aid budget. Yet he trumpeted a £13 billion increase in defence spending.
"It's hard to be certain without more detail from the Treasury, but this figure only seems to make sense if one thinks the defence budget would otherwise have been frozen in cash terms."

Defence secretary John Healey has suggested the real-terms increase in defence spending is "something over £6 billion", after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggested it would mean spending £13.4 billion every year.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Healey was asked about criticism of the figures and said "the definition of defence numbers can be done in different ways".
He explained: "You can take it as a percentage of GDP, you can take it as cash terms.
"What Keir Starmer was talking about yesterday was the increase in hard cash that will be spent on defence in two years' time compared to what's being spent today."
Pushed on whether the £13.4 billion figure would be correct if the assumption was that the Government did not increase the defence budget year on year in line with inflation, Mr Healey said: "Yes, that's the cash... that's a cash number.
"If we were increasing it ... in real terms, taking in inflation, it would be something over £6 billion. Either way, this is a big boost for defence."
'This is a stepping up on defence spending and a stepping up on support for Ukraine'

John Healey said Donald Trump has been "very direct in his challenge" over defence in recent weeks.
Asked whether the increase in defence spending announced on Tuesday is linked to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the US president, the Defence Secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge.
"He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way."
Asked whether the decision means it is expected the US president will be more willing to engage with the UK, Mr Healey said: "I've never had any doubt that President Trump and the US administration ... recognise that the UK is the US's closest defence and security ally, they've challenged us to help lead in Europe."
He added that Sir Keir will be able to say to his American counterpart: "You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base. We are, and we will step up further."
Healey denies Trump is sole cause of defence budget boost

Defence secretary John Healey has insisted pressure from Washington is not the sole reason for the unexpected hike in defence spending, which will be funded by cuts to international aid. 
Speaking from Wellington Barracks, Healey was asked if it is fair to say the UK would not be boosting defence spending if it weren't for Donald Trump."No, it's not", Healey says. "I was with Sir Keir Starmer back in April last year in Barrow when we made the commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of what this country produces.
"That's a level we've not spent in this country for 15 years."
He added that that this promise was made in Labour's election manifesto but is being acted upon now as "the world has changed".

New figures shared on the rise in defence spending by the Government "don't seem to be completely right", the shadow defence secretary said.
James Cartlidge told Times Radio: "It's in the national interest that we increase defence spending, so I do support that in principle.
"Obviously, we've got some questions to follow up on some of what was said in terms of the figures because they don't seem to be completely right in the cold light of day, it's fair to say.
"But we obviously need to look at that, understand what it means, because there was this £13.4 billion extra - that is the entire aid budget and the aid budget is being cut by, we understand about 40 per cent, so we're looking at where the difference arises."
Starmer keen to see relationship with US go 'strength to strength'

John Healey has said he thinks Donald Trump will welcome the UK's increase in defence spending.
Sir Keir Starmer will travel to Washington on Wednesday for talks with the US president.
Asked on Sky News whether he thinks Mr Trump will be welcoming the Prime Minister given this announcement, Mr Healey said "I do" and suggested that Mr Trump has indicated as such.
"The new defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said publicly look, 'Keir Starmer's step was a strong step from an enduring partner and the US-UK relationship'.
"They are our closest security ally, we are strong partners on trade, on economic growth, on technology.
"And Keir Starmer will be saying to President Trump, look, we have a special depth to our relationship that goes back decades, not just on security and defence, but that's at its heart.
"And Keir Starmer will say we want to see that relationship go from strength to strength."
