Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers' proposed budget for 2025-2027 includes several unpopular policies, including axing gendered terms and funding free college tuition for Native Americans.
The nearly 2000-page bill introduced Feb. 18 proposes making references to spouses and parents “gender neutral” by removing terms like “mother,” “father,” “wife” and husband and opting instead for “spouse” and “parent who gave birth to the child,”  to the budget's text. The $119 billion budget also suggests mothers be referred to as the “person inseminated” for birth records relating to artificial insemination.
“Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers' latest left-wing push isn't just out of touch, it's offensive to mothers,” Sara Craig, executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said in a . “Being a mother is the greatest privilege I will have in my lifetime, and every mother I know feels the same. If Tony Evers can reduce motherhood to an 'inseminated person' then our society is lost.”

“As a proud mother of two, it is absolutely insulting that the Governor, in his 2025-27 budget bill, would reduce me and millions of other mothers across Wisconsin to 'inseminated persons,'” Republican Wisconsin Rep. Amanda Nedwesk said in a . “It is not only deeply offensive, but it is an outright attack on the very essence of motherhood. It is unconscionable that the Governor has the audacity to take the most beautiful, life-giving act a woman can perform-bringing children into this world-and turn it into nothing more than gender-neutral, virtue-signaling jargon to appease his far-left base.”
As President Donald Trump has moved to affirm a federal recognition of only two genders and work to end  (DEI) practices, many states have taken to , promising to continue teaching radical gender ideology to children and  into women's bathrooms and locker rooms.  have begun putting a stop to  and made efforts to uphold protections for women's spaces. 
“Governor Evers is a former science teacher,” Nedweski said. “It appears to me that he needs a refresher on basic biology. Last I checked, only one gender is capable of giving birth-women. Anyone who says otherwise is denying science.”
Another stipulation of the bill allows for illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition costs at Wisconsin universities. Wisconsin residents who are part of any federally-recognized native American tribe will also receive free tuition to attend a state university or trade school under the proposed bill.
Despite the Biden administration's  to cancel student loan debt, few Americans strongly support the government  college tuition costs.
Evers' office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.
