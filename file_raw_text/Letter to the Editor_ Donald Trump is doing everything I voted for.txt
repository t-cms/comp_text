Yes, I voted for President Trump, and no, I do not regret my vote. President Trump's 2020 campaign slogan of, "Promises Made Promises Kept" was created 5 years too early. In about a month, the President has made tremendous progress in righting the ship that had strayed, arguably to the edge of the world, under Former President Biden.
To start, President Trump is beginning a long process of enforcing federal law and restoring common sense immigration policy. Border crossings have plummeted by over 90% under President Trump. On day one, the President discontinued service to the CBP One app, which was being used to fly illegal aliens around the United States using taxpayer funds.
The Department of Justice has filed suit against the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago for its derogation of the basic principles of federalism. Tom Homan is working in the field with ICE agents to remove dangerous, criminal illegals from our country. Lastly, President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are working to return to their country-of-origin students at institutions of higher education who are supporting the terrorists in Gaza, Hamas, and furthering anti-semitic vitriol in our country. The President is working to deliver on his promise to send home all 21 million illegal aliens who violated federal law, 8 U.S.C. § 1325, when they broke into our country and derogated our most basic laws under the Biden Administration.
President Trump has also begun the process of clawing back Former President Biden's assault on women and children. Let me be clear, the question of what is a woman does not require any level of critical thinking to answer. For those who might be confused about the definition, please allow me to help, a woman is a biological female who has XX chromosomes.
No number of plastic surgeries, amount of makeup, and significant mental delusion can change that. The President has instituted swift federal action to restore that basic definition of a woman to the forefront of our society. He has signed executive orders preventing men from playing in women's and girls' sports. He has ended Former President Biden's campaign to trans our military and our kids.
The President has restored basic order to the military by limiting those who suffer from gender dysphoria, all transgender individuals, from serving in the military and forcing the taxpayer to fund their mental illness. The President's swift action to prohibit experimental, arguably science experiments, on our nation's youth with puberty blockers and "gender-affirming care" from being pushed onto our youth by those they are meant to trust the most. This is a return to normalcy, something 77,000,000 Americans voted for, and 60% of Louisianians did.
President Trump's crusade against DEI could not have come fast enough. DEI is a Marxist concept that aims to pit the American people against one another. DEI has been used to expose countless children to pornography and borderline grooming materials in our schools.
One must ask themselves, why are their books with graphic depictions of oral sex provided to school-aged children? DEI is not just a battle fought in schools. It must be fought in the workplace as well. Those who purport DEI to be a successful business practice have derogated the simple American idea that merit and merit alone is what makes a person a good candidate.
It was the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. who stood at the Lincoln Memorial and pleaded with the American people to judge people by the content of their character. Why have we begun to stray away from that commonsense standard? President Trump's executive order to impound and stop future funding of any recipient of federal funds that promote DEI is excellent. Why should the taxpayers be asked to fund the destruction of America's culture of meritocracy?
President Trump's reelection was a referendum on radical leftwing social ideology and the perversion of our laws. There are 47 more months of the second Trump Administration and as the President himself always says, "The best is yet to come!"
