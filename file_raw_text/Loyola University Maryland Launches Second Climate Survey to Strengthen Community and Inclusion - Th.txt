Loyola University Maryland Launches Second Climate Survey to Strengthen Community and Inclusion

Loyola University Maryland is asking students, faculty, staff, and administrators to take part in its second climate survey, a tool designed to understand and improve campus life. The survey, created in partnership with Rankin Climate LLC aims to gather feedback about the experiences of Loyola's community members, focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion .
Rankin Climate LLC is an experienced consulting firm that has conducted climate assessments at over 190 schools. Loyola works closely with the firm to adjust the survey questions, making sure it best addresses the unique concerns of the university. The goal is to learn more about the lived experiences of students, faculty, and staff, especially when it comes to inclusion and belonging on campus. 
Loyola's Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer, Dr. Rodney Parker, explained how important it is to get input from all parts of the Loyola community. In his position, Dr. Parker leads the university in overseeing DEI initiatives and actualizing the mission of the university. 
When Dr. Parker joined the Loyola community in 2002, he served for two and a half years as an assistant director in what is now the Center for Community, Service, and Justice. His combined interests in diversity, inclusion, intercultural engagement, and the overall well-being of students have made him an integral part of the Loyola University Maryland community for nearly 20 years. 
"This survey is not just about numbers, it's about understanding how everyone at Loyola experiences the campus. We want all voices to be heard and for everyone to feel valued," Parker said.
The survey is also part of Loyola's ongoing effort to make the campus more inclusive and welcoming for everyone. Dr. Parker noted that Loyola has a DEI plan with the goal of achieving 75% progress over the next three years. This plan focuses on issues that are most important to the campus community and works to make sure every person's dignity is respected. 
"Every voice matters, whether it feels like it does or not. We want everyone to feel like their opinions are important, and that they're helping make Loyola a better place," Parker shared.
Loyola's Diversity and Inclusion Specialist, Rhona Little, shared that the survey will help the university understand where improvements can be made. Little provides direct support to university community members and has a significant role in the implementation of the university's vision and strategic plan for DEI.
A majority of her responsibilities include developing and leading inclusive training for students and employees, collaborating with campus partners to implement DEI best practices, and overseeing the Undergraduate Diversity Advisory Board. 
Little also serves as a Title IX Intake Officer, Sister to Sister Mentor, Restorative Practices Facilitator, and member of the Mental Health Taskforce and the President's Council for Equity and Inclusion.
"The survey is a chance for us to listen to our community. It's a key step in making sure that Loyola is a place where everyone feels included and respected," Little said.
Inclusive Programming Graduate Assistant, Tova Turner, is excited about what the survey will do for the campus. Tova is an emerging leader in event management and is dedicated to creating impactful and engaging experiences for diverse audiences. Currently planning to finish her MBA as part of Loyola University's Emerging Leaders MBA program, Turner brings a strong foundation in business strategy and programming to their work. 
"This survey is a way for people to share their experiences and help us understand what's working and where we can do better. By filling out the survey, you're helping us improve the campus for everyone. It only takes a few minutes, and your voice really counts," Turner said.
To encourage participation, Loyola is offering raffle prizes for those who complete the survey. Students, faculty, and staff have the chance to win free parking for the next academic year or an Apple Watch. Participants must first complete the survey, then follow a separate link to enter the raffle. This ensures that survey answers remain confidential. 
The survey is available both online and on paper to make it accessible to everyone. Loyola's Student Government Association has also played an important role in promoting the survey and encouraging people to take part. 
"It's so important for everyone to be heard. We need as many voices as possible to get the full picture of what's happening on campus," Turner said.
The survey will be open Feb. 4 to March 7 and the raffle winners will be selected after the survey closes. Loyola urges everyone to participate. As Dr. Parker said, "Your voice matters, and together we can make Loyola an even better place for everyone."
