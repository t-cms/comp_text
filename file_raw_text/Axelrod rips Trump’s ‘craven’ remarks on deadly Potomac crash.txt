Democratic strategist David Axelrod  President Trump for “craven” remarks in the aftermath of the plane crash in Washington, D.C.
“Even as the hunt for bodies continues, and before an even preliminary probe could be completed, the @POTUS incredibly, despicably appears to blame the plane crash in Washington on DEI programs at the FAA, and turns a moment of national tragedy into a craven political opportunity,” Axelrod posted .
In a press briefing Thursday,  diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for weakening security following the deadly crash.
An American Airlines flight collided with a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing more than 60 people. Officials said early Thursday that they were switching operations from a rescue mission to a recovery mission, . 
During his briefing, Trump called the tragedy an incident of “terrible proportions,” but he quickly shifted to slamming the Biden and Obama administrations. He criticized hiring initiatives that sought to employ more diverse people.
Axelrod also criticized Trump for slamming former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
“Trump also does a driveby and heaps blame for the plane crash on fmr Transportation Secy @PeteButtigieg, who, not coincidentally, has been touted as a potential candidate for an open U.S. Senate seat in Michigan,” . “Families are grieving and the @POTUS is dining off their tragedy.”
In , Buttigieg responded to Trump’s remarks, calling it “despicable” that the president was using the tragedy as an opportunity to lambast him and the FAA. He called on Trump to show “actual leadership.”
Trump in the White House press briefing room said of Buttigieg:  “He’s a disaster now. He’s just got a good line of bulls‑‑‑. Well he runs it, 45,000 people, and he’s run it right into the ground with his diversity.”
Other Trump administration officials echoed the president’s criticism of the past administration and DEI initiatives. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would be “colorblind” going forward and Vice President Vance suggested that changing hiring standards means they “don’t have the best people” in place.
