The Dangers of Trump's Executive Orders
Lauren Armstrong, Associate EIC
February 19, 2025
Courtesy of Shutterstock Trump has issued a number of executive orders during the first month of his second term.
Since taking office just one month ago, President Donald Trump has signed more than 60 executive orders, many which threaten populations of American citizens. Members of the LGBTQIA+ community, people of color, women and more are under attack, and these ambushes are far from over. From orders reinforcing gender stereotypes to working backwards against the fight on climate change, Trump is putting every American at harm only a month into his term.
Trump's second term began on Jan. 20, 2025, and on that day, he signed 10 orders, the majority of which reversed work done under the Biden administration. These efforts include strides within diversity, equity and inclusion that Biden helped implement nationwide. In the executive order titled "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing," Trump and his administration outline what they believe to have been radical workings towards promoting and enforcing "illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name 'diversity, equity and inclusion ." 
Trump's order was referring to Biden's executive order "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government." Biden's administration aimed to dismantle barriers that prevent marginalized groups from having equal and equitable opportunities throughout the country. Their implementations of this executive order gave funding and resources to federally funded agencies and organizations in order to help change and adapt policies, gain access to increased resources, as well as ensure that all communities throughout the nation were able to implement these actions. Biden's attempts at DEI installations and furthering education were not perfect, yet by setting up the blueprints, Biden was working towards continued progress and long-term solutions that would pave the way for a more inclusive and just society for all Americans, especially those in marginalized communities.
Growing up, I was always told that America was a melting pot where people of different backgrounds, ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, ability levels and sexual orientations could come together to live out their dreams and carve their paths forward. I was taught that America was the land of opportunities and to dream big, because I could accomplish whatever I set my mind out to. However, the Trump administration continues to put forth actions to dismantle this reality, discouraging American citizens to follow their dreams, and from living their authentic lives.
On Feb. 5, 2025, also known as National Women and Girls in Sports Day , Trump signed the executive order "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." There is no irony that Trump chose NWGSD to discredit transgender women across the country, as this act ensures that federally funded organizations no longer allow for transgender women to partake in women and girls sporting leagues and teams. 
Putting the debate of what is fair and equal opportunity in sports aside, the harmful rhetoric used by Trump, his administration and his followers of continuing to refer to transgender women as men, furthermore showcases the increased opportunity of harm towards members of the community. 
Similarly, on Jan. 26, 2025, Trump signed the executive order "Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling," which claims "in many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics," and "similarly, demanding acquiescence to 'White Privilege' or 'unconscious bias,' actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity."
The work being done by the Trump administration to dismantle and ignore the needs for furthering diversity, equity and inclusion measures is shameful. We live in a country divided into sides that share more ideas and values with each other than we believe at first sight. With our political representatives fighting head to head everyday, we as citizens lose sight of the common good. 
The history of this nation is rich, yet it is irresponsible of our country's president to encourage the lack of education of wrongdoings by white citizens, just because he identifies within that group. It is reckless of him to put rules into place to limit the athletic freedom of aspiring athletes, to ignore the privilege of having white skin in this country and to make members of marginalized communities feel even less safe than they previously did. Trump has only been in office for a month, yet the work he has done has already been enough to catch the attention of American citizens, and not in a positive way. Trump poses a danger to all Americans, and the question lies in what we, as a nation, will do to stand up against these policies and protect the rights of every individual, ensuring that no American is left behind in the pursuit of equality and justice for allmpCou
