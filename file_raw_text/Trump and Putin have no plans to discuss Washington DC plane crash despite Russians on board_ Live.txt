More Americans are in favor of President Donald Trump's attempt to curb birthright citizenship than are against it, a new poll reveals, as presidential approval is improving post-inauguration.
The controversial executive order issued by Trump at the inauguration aims to end birthright citizenship for children of migrants, who are in the US on temporary visas or illegally. The move has already faced lawsuits from dozens of states and affected parties.
Yet a new poll from Emerson College post-inauguration, carried out from 27 to 28 January, shows 45 per cent of Americans support Trump's efforts to roll back birthright citizenship for children of undocumented migrants.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday that the Trump administration has revoked a decision that would have protected roughly 600,000 people from Venezuela from deportation, putting some at risk of being removed from the country in about two months.
Noem signed a notice reversing a move by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, in the waning days of the Biden administration to extend Temporary Protected Status. The change is effective immediately and comes amid a slew of actions as the Trump administration works to make good on promises to crack down on illegal immigration and carry out the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history.
"Before he left town, Mayorkas signed an order that said for 18 months they were going to extend this protection to people that are on Temporary Protected Status, which meant that they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months," Noem told "Fox and Friends."
"We stopped that," Noem said.

Sec. of Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan spoke with press on the North Driveway of the White House and answered questions about President Donald Trump's announcement about a migrant facility at Guantanamo Bay.
Homan said: "What you probably don't know, is there's already a migrant center there, it's been there for decades. So we're just going to expand upon that existing migrant center."
He added that ICE would run it. "ICE has the highest detention standards in the industry," he said, whether federal, state, or local. "So every facility, including GITMO will have the highest standards."
Noem said this is something the White House is working on, "to use resources that we currently have."
"We're going after these guys," she added.
"We're already doing it," Noem said. "We're building it out."
In answer to a question about civilian oversight, Noem said "Civilian oversight would be the same as current civilian oversight in federal government today."
"We had an election in November that clearly says the American people don't want these criminal and dangerous individuals on our streets anymore," she said.
"The law applies to everybody" - American citizens, people who come to the country illegally, Noem said. "You will be held accountable for breaking our laws."
Both referred to Guantanamo Bay as being for "the worst of the worst."

U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Wednesday to combat antisemitism and pledge to deport non-citizen college students and others who took part in pro-Palestinian protests, a White House official said.
A fact sheet on the order promises "immediate action" by the Justice Department to prosecute "terroristic threats, arson, vandalism and violence against American Jews" and marshal all federal resources to combat what it called "the explosion of antisemitism on our campuses and streets" since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you," Trump said in the fact sheet.
"I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before," the president said, echoing a 2024 campaign promise.
Rights groups and legal scholars said the measure would violate constitutional free speech rights and would likely draw legal challenges.
