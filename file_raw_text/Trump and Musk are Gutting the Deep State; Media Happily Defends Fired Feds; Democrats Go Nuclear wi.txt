LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": Alayna, thank you so much. Great to see you as always.
And that's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media, of course, on X and Instagram, and thank you for watching.
Remember, it is America now and forever, and it is only getting better.
Jesse Watters, he takes it from here.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
RENE MARSH, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What is the general feeling across government?
UNIDENTIFIED DEI GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE: Grief. They're angry. Many that are confused.
WATTERS: The shadow government is getting DOGE'd.
ELON MUSK, CO-DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: The future is going to be amazing.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They say the most successful two weeks in the history of any presidency. Now all we have to do is keep it going for another couple of hundred weeks.
WATTERS: Trump has a need for speed.
TRUMP: Step on it, Willie.
FORMER BIDEN SUPPORTER: This (bleep) political party. This is a cadre of criminals and losers. This party lied to me while stealing my tax dollars.
WATTERS: The Democrats have fallen and they can't get up.
FORMER BIDEN SUPPORTER: Y'all are never going to win another political race ever again.
WATTERS: Plus --
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: Do you want to spend your tax paying dollars on Sesame Street in Iraq?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sesame Street in Iraq?
WATTERS: The DOGE father is on the loose, and no federal job is safe. Their plan for the Deep State, gut it all.
Over 40,000 federal bureaucrats have already taken buyouts, and we're only in week three.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We expect that number to increase, and that alone, just the 40,000 again, we expect it to increase. It's going to save the American people tens of millions of dollars, and we encourage federal workers in this city to accept the very generous offer.
If they don't want to show up to the office, if they want to rip the American people off, then they're welcome to take this buyout, and we'll find highly competent individuals who want to fill these roles.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Elon and his Nerd Army have been combing through agencies blasting away bloat. Twenty-year-old DOGErs are clashing with lazy old timers who don't know how to use a computer and are calling them idiots.
And breaking news, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has just fired 90 percent of the administrators at USAID. They took a 10,000-man agency and streamlined it to 300 employees.
The media is calling it the Trumpocalypse.
CNN cast off Oliver Darcy says "The American experiment is convulsing before our eyes," and he is flabbergasted that the media hasn't gone into round the clock special coverage. "Media executives need not fret about being the boy who cried wolf. The wolf is now in the barn and mauling the livestock."
The Democrats and the media have never seen a president execute a mandate with speed and precision. The country voted for change, and we're watching representative government in the 21st Century.
The feds, they call that war.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANDREA GALBRAITH, FEDERAL WORKER: Nobody wants to work in this type of condition where we're going to be in a psychological warfare -- for how long?
NBC NEWS REPORTER: Other federal workers not revealing their names because of concern over retribution, described to NBC News, fear and panic, an Orwellian nightmare.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Federal workers are worried about payback and psychological warfare. How do you think the whole country has felt for the last 20 years, having to tiptoe around DEI, hauled into HR for jokes, canceled for an opinion, watching Black Lives Matter light us on fire, a guy wearing a dress raped a girl in the girl's bathroom, and the girl's dad got arrested for raising his voice?
A DEI bureaucrat at the Department of Justice making six figures, who's going to get a buyout with an eight-month severance deal. They're not a victim.
CNN is putting spot shadows on feds like their lives are in danger.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARSH: What is the general feeling across government, amongst your fellow federal workers right now?
UNIDENTIFIED FEDERAL WORKER: Grief. They're angry, many that are confused, but all kind of grieving in their own way.
MARSH: How does it feel to be targeted for the work that you're so passionate about?
It's okay. You could take your time.
UNIDENTIFIED FEDERAL WORKER: It actually makes me proud of the people that I've worked with and the things that we've done.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACDONALD: CNN spot chatting a woman who's worked from home, and now she's crying because she doesn't want to go back to the office. This is insane.
CNN just laid off hundreds of employees to cut costs because their books aren't balanced because no one is watching them. No one is interviewing fired CNN staff, not even Don Lemon.
Getting fired isn't a war crime. I've been fired four times, and thank God, because it turned out all right.
Since when has CNN cared about people losing their jobs? They didn't weep when Biden whacked the Keystone pipeline workers. CNN has been trying to get everybody fired at Fox for years.
If CNN doesn't like what you say, they call your boss, they call your advertisers. They try to bankrupt you and boycott you.
Random Americans who crack jokes on Facebook, CNN was putting them on blast, trying to get them canceled. CNN cheered on Biden for firing Army officers who didn't get vaxxed, guys who were willing to die for this country.
CNN said, good, get them out of here.
CNN's boss can lay off people. Why can't Trump?
Bill Clinton fired almost 400,000 federal workers. That wasn't a constitutional crisis. The government had to slim down. Bill and Newt cut the fat, balanced the budget, and Democrats are acting like we're witnessing a genocide.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): Let me remind you who set the house on fire. It was y'all. It feels as if y'all have just decided that y'all are going to castrate your constitutional duty and hand it over to someone who was unelected.
REP. GREG CASAR (D-TX): Fire, Elon Musk.
Elon Musk took control of our country's financial nuclear codes.
REP. NANETTE BARRAGAN (D-CA): House Republicans have allowed billionaire, Elon Musk and his gang of thieves to enter the US Treasury Department; fire the people entrusted with secret private information about Americans and give them that access.
REP. MARK POCAN (D-WI): Elon Musk is destroying our federal government. He feels he bought himself a president.
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): Now, we've got Donald Trump and his co- president, Elon Musk, and they're just running a wrecking ball through it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats want to audit you for a $600.00 Venmo payment. But when Elon audits the trillion dollar government, they're ready to storm the castle.
Why are Democrats shocked?
We're putting the government on a diet. Trump and Musk campaigned on it and won on it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MUSK: We're going to be very open and transparent and be very clear about this is what we're doing, here are the issues. This is -- this is the math for what is being spent, and what -- you know, and we're going to make it - - we're going to make the spending lower.
If somebody has got a better idea for how to make the spending lower, well, tell us. But if we don't, we're going to bankrupt the country.
TRUMP: I will create a Government Efficiency Commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms.
As the first order of business, this commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months. This will save trillions of dollars -- trillions.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats aren't surprised this is Trump's agenda, they are surprised he's able to execute it because, after years of incompetence, no one thought anyone was capable of doing anything in Washington.
Elon says there's a way to know when you're over the target.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
MUSK: One of the things I remember from the PayPal days was that you know who complains the loudest? It is the fraudsters. Okay, so, like the -- so when somebody is trying to defraud PayPal, where we would see the most amount of righteous indignation, like it would be like, immediate over the top righteous indignation was from the fraudsters, not from honest people, because honest people are like, I think there's something wrong with my account, I guess, I wonder what's wrong. Let me inquire.
But the forces will come at you immediately. This is -- it's like -- it's like a tell that someone is actually doing fraud, because the level of sort of faux outrage is way over the top.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
WATTERS: Elon doesn't care about bad press. He's trying to save the Republic. It's good cop, bad cop. Trump's the good cop. He's the bad cop.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We're catching them left and right. We're catching them. We're catching them to a point where they don't know what the heck is going on. They can't believe they're getting caught. And I have great respect for the people that are doing it.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Elon Musk is helping us on it. He's pretty good. He's pretty good.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The government has been robbing us blind. We've been writing checks, $6 million for tourism in Egypt. Lake Egypt needs help with that. They have the pyramids.
We should be spending money on cleaning up California so that tourists can vacation in California. $2million to help the BBC value the diversity of Libyan society.
We're bribing the BBC to cover Libya better. Why?
A million for a gay group in Armenia. There it is.
We paid $20 million for Iraqi Sesame Street.
(IRAQI "AHLAN SIMSIM" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WATTERS: You paid for Bert and Ernie in Baghdad. Weren't we just bombing these people? Now, we're paying for their Muppet shows.
We're sick. There is something sick with us.
You also paid for an Irish DEI musical.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On behalf of Ambassador Cronin, it is an honor to welcome all of her guests to Deerfield tonight for this important event.
Increasing access to opportunity and equity is a cornerstone of the Biden administration, and we're so proud to play a small part in that here.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: This is a government theft ring. We spent $2 million for trans surgeries in Guatemala. I'm going to go out on a limb. One Guatemalan dude got breast implants, and we probably kicked back the rest of the cash to a crooked Guatemalan politician and the corrupt liberal CEO of the group they laundered the money through.
Because all this money we're spending, we could have turned the whole world trans. We could have made every man a woman, and every woman a man with this kind of money. You really think it costs $20 million to produce an episode of Sesame Street? You could hire Tom Cruise to play Oscar the Grouch for that money.
Check this: Biden paid nearly $5 billion to unnamed foreign sources. Whoever is getting our money is so shady our government can't even put it in writing. They just call it "aid."
I bet a lot of this money is to bribe foreign officials to win bids for American companies, or to bribe foreign politicians just to have in our pockets, or just to subsidize far left foundations.
Most of the people getting money from these grants aren't in the country. They pump it into overseas organizations, and then we never see them. Any liberal with an International Women's Studies degree can launch a 501 c3, apply for a government grant and spin it off into a left wing piggy bank.
USAID paid $235 million to the National Democratic Institute. Well, that sounds benign. No, millions of that money went to executive compensation, meaning salaries for all the liberals with no skills.
I bet most of that money didn't go to supporting democracy. It went to supporting liberal lifestyles.
Democrats have been sucking off the teeth of government for decades, and Trump caught them. As one Trump insider says, "You bring USAID to heal, and you end the Democrat gravy train." USAID is just the beginning. You start peeling back at the layers of every agency, and all you find out is pork that winds up in the wrong people's pockets.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): The white coat waste project exposed more than 10 million in taxpayer funds that were spent creating transgender mice, rats and monkeys.
The Biden-Harris administration spent 2.5 million taxpayer dollars, 2.5 million taxpayer dollars to study the fertility of transgender mice.
We spent over a million dollars to find out if female rats receiving testosterone therapy were more likely to overdose on a date rape drug.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: One of those multimillion dollar studies was at the University of Michigan. How much do you want to bet a Democrat wants to go to a game at Ann Arbor, front row seats? Anyone from the Biden team wants to land at Ann Arbor? Here's an office, a campus, an apartment and a no show job with benefits.
Government has fed the pigs so much it turned into a hog. You know what happens to hogs? They get slaughtered. And the American people love a good butcher.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FORMER BIDEN SUPPORTER: This (bleep) political party. The Democratic Party have lied to us about everything. What the last several weeks have proven to us all is that this was a part -- this is a cadre of criminals and losers and spoiled children of affluent parents who were more concerned about looking good than actually doing good.
Now, we come to USAID being probably the largest money laundering operation in American history.
Congratulations, Dems, you have outdone -- you've outdone even Bernie Madoff.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Chris Rufo joins me now.
All right, Chris, you know a lot about this DEI corruption gravy train. So if you have some lesbian Sesame Street episode in Baghdad for 20 mil, where is that $20 million actually going?
CHRISTOPHER RUFO, SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Well, we know exactly where these kind of grants go. They are padding the pockets of left wing activists in the United States and abroad.
The government is the single largest benefactor of left wing ideologies anywhere on the planet. These are ideologies that are popular nowhere, except for a few pockets of East Coast and West Coast cities. But when the public sees waste, the left sees patronage, that's exactly what this is.
They're taking hard earned taxpayer cash from every Trump voter in the United States, and they're giving it to the gender theorists. They're giving it to the critical race ideologies. They're giving it to the DEI activists.
Trump is right to shut it down. Elon Musk is exactly the man for the job. He's laser focused.
I was at the White House yesterday and everyone is buzzing about these DOGE boys going in and getting the keys to the castle, rooting out this waste, and that's why the left is squealing, because they're losing their lifeline and they're losing the only way that they can survive.
WATTERS: So this money is like a meal plan for the liberal army, and you send it, let's say, to a -- what was that like -- a DEI opera in Ireland. So that's like, what Joe Biden's cousin's opera? Is that how this works?
RUFO: Yes, it could be. I would actually love to see the opera. That would be something fun to watch. But look, there's no shortage of examples. I saw one last night on the database that was teaching transgender, pansexual and non-binary people in New York City how to farm vegetables.
It's not really clear were they making a pansexual plantation. I'm not really sure what it was, but the fact is, is that the reason that left wing activists can show up on a Tuesday morning and protest in any major city is because the government is paying their bills through these NGOs. The American people should not stand for it. It's time to shut it down.
WATTERS: I didn't know the soil was so fertile here in Manhattan. What is a pansexual by the way?
RUFO: A pansexual is someone who appreciates and loves all different bodies, sexualities, and identities. It's essentially taking the bar and putting it all the way to the bottom. If it moves, if it breathes, they're interested.
WATTERS: Okay. I'm scared that you know that, Rufo, but thank you for answering accurately. We like that.
RUFO: Only through research, not through personal experience, Jesse.
WATTERS: All right, Chris Rufo knows a lot about this. It looks like this is going to never stop. Thank you so much.
Up next, Donald Trump and God.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Trump slammed into Washington like a typhoon, and there's a lot more rain in the forecast.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The first two weeks have been probably, they say, the most successful two weeks in the history of any presidency. Now, all we have to do is keep it going for another couple of hundred weeks.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Joe rode a bicycle, 47 is flooring a Ferrari. "Trump has made public appearances and taken media questions almost every single day. Each EO signing turns into a press conference. Every trip on Air Force one, an impromptu gaggle with hacks. Trump has dominated every moment of the news agenda. Joe Biden, he is not."
This isn't by accident. Trump's inner circle has been plotting for years.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: So what we've got to do is just hit, hit, hit, and keep it. It's momentum, momentum that the opposition party is the media, and the media can only because they're dumb and they're lazy, they can only focus on one thing at a time.
All we have to do is flood the zone every day. We hit them with three things. They'll bite on one, and we'll get all of our stuff done -- bang, bang, bang. These guys will never -- will never be able to recover.
But we've got to start with muzzle velocity.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The momentum continued today.
Attorney General Pam Bondi dropping the investigation into Project Veritas. Remember, they got their hands on Ashley Biden's diary back in 2020, and Bondi is suing Illinois and Chicago for interfering with ICE deportations.
Secretary Rubio is now in charge of the persnickety librarians at the National Archives. Remember the ones who kicked off the Trump raid.
And the President met with Congress to lay out his tax plan. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: No tax on tips, which is obviously a very public campaign promise that the president made. No tax on seniors' Social Security. No tax on overtime pay. Renewing President Trump's 2017 middle class tax cuts.
Again, these are the president's priorities: Adjusting the SALT cap, eliminate all the special tax breaks for billionaire sports team owners, close the carried interest tax deduction loophole, tax cuts for made in America products. This will be the largest tax cut in history for middle class, working Americans.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump isn't just cleaning house, he's doing some new decorating.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The stories of legends like Washington, Winthrop and Williams remind us that without faith in God, there would be no American story. Every citizen should be proud of this exceptional heritage.
I have signed an executive order to resume the process of creating a new National Park full of statues of the greatest Americans who ever lived.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The president attended the National Prayer Breakfast today and where he told us how facing death changed his life.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: None of us knows exactly when our time on earth will be over. You never know. A truth I confronted a few short months ago.
If I was a little more than that 90-degree angle, it would be no good. And if I was a little less, it would be -- it had to be perfect. The thing went right along the edge.
It didn't affect my hair. Can you believe it?
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: It might have touched it, but not where it counts, not the skin part, but it's -- no honestly, it's a very -- it changed, it changed something in me, I feel. I feel even stronger.
I believed in God, but I feel -- I feel much more strongly about it. Something happened. So thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Then Trump called for every American to bring God back into their lives.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We want to come together and -- the happiest -- the person, the element, the everything that's going to be happy. People of religion are going to be happy again. And I really believe you can't be happy without religion, without that belief. I really believe it. I just don't see how you can do.
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: So let's bring religion back. Let's bring God back into our lives.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And then we learned what motivates the president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: One floor below us, Reverend Graham's statue stands with an open Bible. The page turned to a letter from the Apostle Paul, which reads, "Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season, we will reap if we do not give up." Never give up. Never ever give up. You can't.
How about me? If I would have given up, I would not be here right now. Who the hell knows where I'd be. It might not be a good place. If it was up to the Democrats, it would not be a good place at all.
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: Never, ever give up.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Jillian Michaels is the host of the "Keeping it Real" podcast.
All right, Jillian, you strike me as someone who maintains incredible discipline, focus, energy, endurance. Is that what you're seeing right now in Washington?
JILLIAN MICHAELS, BUSINESSWOMAN AND NUTRITIONIST: Jesse, I'm seeing that squared.
When Steve Bannon said that the media is too lazy and dumb to keep up with him, I was ashamed, because I can't keep up with him.
I was keeping score in the beginning because there was so much winning, you know, and I was doing a little bit of gloating. And now I'm just -- every day you wake up to a new headline like, oh, Panama, Greenland, the USAID. I mean, he's incredible. I don't know -- I honestly don't know how he's doing it.
WATTERS: You know, if you're against what he's doing, all you're doing is complaining, but these are good things for the country, so I guess he's right. You're not going to get tired of winning.
When you hear him say, never give up. I know you're highly motivated. Jillian Michaels, how do you think the country takes that?
MICHAELS: Well, I'm hoping they're inspired. I can tell you personally, having gone through hardships in my life and knowing that success is a matter of attrition, and you persist, but this is a guy that has been sued so many times with criminal charges, just one lawsuit is enough to make you lose hair and lose sleep, right?
This guy endured all of that and then got shot in the head, and you cannot help but think, okay, hold on a second, if he can do all of this and keep fighting and come out on top, what am I capable of?
I don't even look at this guy as a politician anymore. I look at him, honestly, as a source of inspiration of what am I capable of if he can live through all of this and come out on top? It's amazing.
WATTERS: He's not going to fall asleep at the beach, that's for sure.
How do you think RFK, Jr. is looking now? He got out of committee on a good vote. I think next week we should find out.
MICHAELS: I'm feeling exceptionally positive. You know, I hear little whispers -- I'm on the outside of everything, but there are little birdies, they give me tips and little bits of information. So I feel extraordinarily optimistic.
And quite honestly, there is something about this administration that does feel destined. Just the fact that the president got shot in the freaking head and survived, and this grassroots movement with RFK, like we've come so far, I can't even imagine it falling apart now.
And another shoutout that I would like to give the president, he could have thrown RFK to the wolves. You could have said, listen, you know, I got the independent vote. I got what I wanted, like, I don't need to die on this hill with private industry and special interests like he didn't make it, he didn't make it.
And he and JD Vance went down there and they spoke to the senators, and they fought for them. And I'm so impressed. I'm so grateful, and I'm excited to see what comes to be honest.
WATTERS: It is a destiny situation, you're right, and it's good. It's about time.
Jillian, great to talk to you. Thank you so much. Have a great evening.
MICHAELS: Thanks, Jesse. You too.
WATTERS: The Democrat knife fight just got nastier.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Democrats in the media held each other's hands for years. When Democrats needed a shoulder to cry on, legacy media was there for support.
But now they're both hot messes. The head of AXIOS says liberal media has never been weaker.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES VANDEHEI, CEO, AXIOS: For the first time in our lifetimes, I would argue the media ecosystem favors the right more than it favors the left. The MAGA movement, podcast, X, how people get information favors Republicans and really favors Trump.
And so he has everything working for him in terms of his ability to do a lot fast and stretch the boundaries of what we're used to, in terms of the power of the presidency.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And the Democrats are just downright toxic.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TARA PALMERI, JOURNALIST: Why is the Democratic Party viewed as toxic by so many? Like even people inside the party acknowledge that.
SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): I think their primary currency was shaming and scolding and talking down to people and telling them, hey, I know better than you, or you're dopes, or you're a bro, or you're ignorant, or, you know, don't you -- you know, how can you be this dumb?
If you go to an extreme and you become a boutique kind of a proposition, then you're going to lose -- you're going to lose the argument.
PALMERI: How do Democrats win back White men like yourself?
FETTERMAN: I don't know. And truthfully, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure if that's possible to be honest.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: They're dying on the strangest hills, too.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: He is describing what is currently the dumbest strategy in politics, which is Democrats taking the 20 percent side of every 80/20 issue in America.
USAID, people want this pared down. They want to streamline it. They want to know where the money is going. Democrats have a meltdown.
Today, Donald Trump signs executive order on keeping boys out of girls sports. Democrats take the 20 side of that issue as well.
All of these issues, this is like Trump's superpower, finding a bunch of 80/20 issues getting on the 80, and everybody who are sort of reflexively against him gets on the 20, and now the Democratic Party has like a 31 percent approval rating.
This is why.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: It's a simple fix. All the left has to do is listen, but Democrats are defiant. They have no interest in getting it together, not a book plug, but might as well be, so instead, they keep latching on to identity politics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CARI CHAMPION, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It's not popular issues. I don't want to interrupt you. I thought it was about eggs. We're not talking about eggs anymore. It's not about it. It was never about eggs.
It was about race. And if we're honest, if I see something, say something, we've been told that since we were kids, if you see something say something, it's not about eggs.
ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It is --
CHAMPION: It is not about -- it's not it's about -- it's about making sure that there is White Supremacy in this country. And if we're honest, we will say that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The left is miserable, which is why Americans voted them out. All they care about is victimology.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm not talking about how you felt, I'm talking about how I feel. Me, a Black woman in this country.
I've got a law degree, a masters and two bachelors, probably more education that all y'all added up together at this table.
ARTHUR AIDALA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Okay. Fine by me.
ALLISON: All right, and I have always been the least paid person on payroll at every institution I have worked in, and it's not even --
AIDALA: Even the White House?
ALLISON: Even in the White House.
AIDALA: Well, whose fault is that? I don't think you worked for George W. or Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Did that argument not convince you?
AOC says you're a victim of a vast right wing conspiracy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): It was really hard watching people and communities that I am aligned with fall for right wing misinformation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Yes, that's not what happened. People just got tired of Democrats lying.
So the whole party is in shambles and Pelosi not helping. She is twisting the knife and the Big Guy's back. She says things would have been worse if Biden was at the top of the ticket.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Well, all I know is that we won a seat in the House. We did not lose any seats. People were like, well, the Democrats lost. No, we did not.
I think it would have been quite different with President Biden at the top of the ticket.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: She still hasn't even talked to Joe or Jill, but she says she would coup him again for the children.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC HOST: The former First Lady, Jill Biden, has spoken out saying she was disappointed in you. Is there any way to patch that up? Have you spoken to the former president?
PELOSI: Well, I certainly hope so. No, I haven't, but the fact is that we're all on a mission for the American people, for the American people, for America's working families.
My whole passion about being in politics is for the children. So what is it that we're doing for the children? I think that it would have been important for the children to not have Donald Trump be president of the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Sorry, kids, Trump is back, and so is the Golden Age. The rest of the party should take that as a warning call.
If you want to salvage whatever political careers you have left, scrap everything and start over.
Howard Dean screamed at the best.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HOWARD DEAN, FORMER DNC CHAIR: the Democrats need to have a complete reboot. They've been functioning inside the beltway and that's what their tendency is. The name Democrat has been branded really badly, and we don't run enough local candidates to un-brand it.
We leave whole swaths of legislative seats unchallenged in red states. That is insane.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Jimmy Failla is the host of "Fox News Saturday Night."
So Dean says the Democrats have to reboot, Jimmy.
JIMMY FAILLA, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST "FOX NEWS SATURDAY NIGHT": Oh, man. Think about this, Justin Baldoni is less popular with Blake Lively than the Democrats are with American voters, like we're at historic inflection point here for them, because the issue they have, and this is where Trump wins.
Trump is a businessman, he is listening to the customer. The Democrats are trying to change the customer's preferences. Okay. Nobody out there wanted a transgender superhero.
There's not a kid out there looking to read a comic book called Wonder if it's a Woman, okay. And that's their biggest problem.
When you talk about 80/20 issues and dying on the wrong hill, okay, they need to take L's in the areas they should take them in and kind of live to fight another day. But the people that are just blindly challenging everything look like idiots. That's the problem.
WATTERS: The customer is always right.
FAILLA: Thank you. That's the point.
WATTERS: And you know that better than anybody.
FAILLA: Hey, girl, especially when you get into a taxi, if they go and go to the South Street Seaport, you go, you should try the Intrepid.. Okay, that's what the Democrats would do. Like, what do you mean? I got my kids in the back. They want to go see the pirate show.
WATTERS: So Nancy says we have to do this for the kids.
FAILLA: Yes.
WATTERS: Everything is for the children.
FAILLA: It's so funny, because everybody in the Democratic Party who talks about children looks like they don't belong around them, you know. And she has that energy going on.
And I love the thing with her and Biden, and to be clear, he did try to call her, but he was talking into a banana. You know what I mean??
It's such a shamble. But how do you not love this? And by the way, to the point of AOC --
WATTERS: Yes.
FAILLA: Does she ever discuss her district?
WATTERS: No.
FAILLA: Never. You will never catch her -- I will talk in public about my search history more than AOC will talk about her district.
WATTERS: Her district is a red light district.
FAILLA: Dude, it is the hooker Hall of Fame, dude. So every ex cabbie I worked with, that's where all the night business is now. You go to the Boulevard of Sweethearts and it's just lawless migrant hookers.
Homan, get on it. Let's go, Homan.
WATTERS: All right, let's go ICE some hookers at AOC's district.
After you get the guy who is living above the garage at the governor of New Jersey's house.
FAILLA: Yes, yes.
WATTERS: Can you believe Murphy?
FAILLA: No, I love that. And yes, he called it out. Yes, good luck trying to get her. I believe it was you on "The Five" the other day was like, easiest raid ever. You just kind of doxed her.
WATTERS: Yes.
FAILLA: Which is like, some of these people, no one is listening to themselves and that's the point, and he is crushing it.
WATTERS: All right. So are you.
FAILLA: Hey, girl. I am fine.
WATTERS: The ratings fairy.
FAILLA: The ratings fairy back.
WATTERS: Saturday night.
FAILLA: 10:00 PM.
WATTERS: Anything could happen.
FAILLA: Except the Michelle Obama joke.
WATTERS: That was even too much for me.
