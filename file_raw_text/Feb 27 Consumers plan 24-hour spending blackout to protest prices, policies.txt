This Friday, a consumer boycott is planned to protest excessive spending. The blackout has been widely shared on social media, with organizers calling for a 24-hour halt in consumer spending on Feb. 28. The protest stems from opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, as well as former President Donald Trump's efforts to roll back federal DEI programs since taking office. The movement, called the "blackout," was organized by The People's Union.
While the boycott is primarily driven by political concerns, many participants are also protesting rising prices and the state of the retail industry. In addition to general price increases, delivery and shipping fees have surged due to higher gas prices. As a result, organizers are urging people to refrain from making online purchases from major retailers such as Amazon and eBay.
The boycott also extends to the food industry, with participants encouraged to avoid fast-food chains. Food prices have risen significantly over the past five years, with meals that once cost $8 now priced at around $13. While fast-food apps offer reward programs, they require consumers to spend a certain amount to earn benefits, which some argue has contributed to financial strain and an increase in unhealthy eating habits.
If consumers must make purchases, they are encouraged to support local businesses instead. However, small and family-owned businesses could be more vulnerable to the economic effects of the boycott than larger corporations. Local restaurants remain a recommended option, even beyond the blackout.
The consumer boycott is set to begin at 12 a.m. Friday and last for 24 hours. However, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on overall retail sales. While participants hope to send a message, the short duration of the blackout may not lead to lasting economic change.
