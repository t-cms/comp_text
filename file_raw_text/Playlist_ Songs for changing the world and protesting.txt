This past month, Grammy award winning rapper and artist Kendrick Lamar performed at the Super Bowl halftime show. While there was reference of his rival Drake throughout the show, Kendrick also decorated his performance with subtle political messaging.
The most direct shot came when Kendrick said "the revolution is about to be televised, you picked the right time but the wrong guy", referencing the newly elected president Donald Trump.
The recent election of Donald Trump, his eradication of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies in education and the overturning of Roe V. Wade in 2022 has seen many protest come about. On Feb. 17, protestors stood outside the statehouse in Columbia to protest the Trump-inspired policies.
In a political climate like this, it is imperative we use our voices to promote change. Protest in the streets with anthems such as "Alright" by Kendrick Lamar, "Get Up, Stand Up" by Bob Marley & The Wailers and "HIND'S HALL" by Macklemore.
