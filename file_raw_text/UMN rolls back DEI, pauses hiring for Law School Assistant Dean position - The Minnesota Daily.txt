UMN rolls back DEI, pauses hiring for Law School Assistant Dean position

The search for a new assistant dean of diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Minnesota Law School is paused as the University reassesses its DEI programs, according to an email from Dean William McGeveran to Law School students, faculty and staff on Friday.
It is unclear whether the University will implement more hiring pauses or roll-backs on DEI as it could face fines from the federal government for the continuation of these programs.
The University has resources available for students on its Office for Equity and Diversity page, but multiple Minnesota Daily reporters called the office and found the number appears to be disconnected.
"This is a disappointing development for many, and I know it brings questions and uncertainty for our community," McGeveran said in the email. "My commitment to supporting all of our students, faculty, and staff remains unchanged, as does the Law School's mission of building a legal profession representative of the people it serves."
McGeveran said all finalist visits for the dean position were canceled, but many programs within the law school will continue.
This pause comes just weeks after President Donald Trump's executive order banning DEI initiatives in any programs receiving federal funding.
Trump said he would fine schools with diversity programs - which he called discrimination - up to the full amount of their endowment, the Associated Press reported.
The Minnesota Daily reached out to University public relations, but they did not respond. This story will be updated upon their response.
This is a developing story. Check back here for updates.
