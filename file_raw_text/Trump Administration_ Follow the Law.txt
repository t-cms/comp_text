Trump Administration: Follow the Law
President Donald J. Trump and his administration have a simple message: follow the law. Since taking office, the Trump Administration has wasted no time taking action against states and entities which have opted for defiance.
Here are only a few examples:
* The Department of Education has launched investigations into the California Interscholastic Federation and the Minnesota State High School League over their failures to comply with President Trump's executive order protecting girls in sports. The department has also announced probes into the widespread anti-Semitic harassment at five public universities across the country.
* The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sued the State of New York and its top officials over their willful failure to comply with federal immigration laws. The DOJ has also filed lawsuits against the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago over their dangerous and illegal so-called "sanctuary" policies.
* The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has announced referrals to the Office of Inspector General and the DOJ over a scheme by outgoing Biden EPA staffers to bury billions of dollars in federal funding at an outside financial institution in an effort to shield the funds from oversight and accountability.
* The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opened an investigation into discriminatory DEI policies at Comcast -- an entity which it regulates -- following President Trump's executive order ending such policies. The FCC has also taken action against a Soros-backed, San Francisco-based radio station after the station broadcasted the locations of undercover federal immigration authorities conducting dangerous operations in the area, and has launched an investigation into NPR and PBS over potential violations of federal laws.
* The Department of Homeland Security has "clawed back" tens of millions of dollars in funds paid by rogue FEMA officials to house illegal aliens in luxury New York City hotels.
