Highlight: Proposal by think tank for tech giant to ‘cease DEI efforts’ rejected by shareholders
Body


Apple shareholders have voted to keep the iPhone maker’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, despite pressure to drop them from President Trump and conservative activists. 
At Apple’s annual meeting on Tuesday, shareholders rejected a proposal by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, that called on Apple to “cease DEI efforts”. 
The think tank criticised Apple’s “inclusion and diversity” programme, including policies to employ a “VP of Inclusion & Diversity”; to allow employee member groups for those deemed “diverse” but not for others; and the contribution of shareholder money to organisations that advance DEI. 
However, investors at the company’s annual meeting backed Apple’s management, which had opposed efforts to
. 
Proponents of the proposal argued that recent legal changes meant Apple would see an increase in discrimination cases if it continued with DEI policies. Apple said it has a “well-established compliance programme” and the think tank’s proposal “inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple’s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies”.
Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, said the company has never had quotas or targets in its diversity programmes. “As the legal landscape around these issues evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,” Cook added.
Apple’s inclusion and diversity programme includes a commitment to “create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level”.
The company says its products and services are designed to be inclusive, citing the development of Face ID, where its designers worked to ensure that its machine learning model had extensive, diverse data. 

A conservative backlash to DEI policies has put pressure on companies including Meta Platforms and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, to 
 before and following Trump’s return to the White House. The president has criticised corporate DEI programmes, suggesting that the US Department of Justice could investigate whether they violate the law.
Shareholders in 
 voted against a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research asking for the company to report on the risks of maintaining its DEI initiatives at a meeting in January.
