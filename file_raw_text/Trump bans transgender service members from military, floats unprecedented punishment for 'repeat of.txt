It's not going to be an easy road for Tulsi Gabbard to be confirmed as Donald Trump's director of national intelligence.
For one, she will almost surely be asked about whey she  and about her parroting Russian talking points.
But that's not the only area where she might face significant questioning.
Senator Angus King, an Independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, told The Independent that she faces significant questions about her previous support for Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency intelligence contractor and whistleblower who leaked classified documents revealing the existence of U.S. global surveillance programs. 
Gabbard went so . She'll also have to deal with other areas where she'll likely encounter opposition.
"There are still issues about her position of the 702 for example," Collins told The Independent.
Some Republicans object to her stance on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the gathering of foreign intelligence on non-Americans outside of the United States without a warrant. Gabbard has tried to walk back her earlier criticism of the program, but Collins said she had issues with Gabbard's responses.

Justice Department fires officials who helped with Jack Smith's Trump prosecutions

 that several officials who worked on the criminal investigations into Donald Trump have been fired.
In a letter to the officials, acting Attorney General James McHenry said they cannot be "trusted" to "faithfully" implement Trump's agenda.
You played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump. The proper functioning of government critically depends on the trust superior officials place in their subordinates. Given your significant role in prosecuting the President, I do not believe that the leadership of the Department can trust you to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully. As a result, pursuant to Article Il of the Constitution and the laws of the United States, your employment with the Department of Justice is hereby terminated, and you are removed from federal service effective immediately.
Some of the individuals worked with special counsel Jack Smith, whose office was closed after he dropped the two criminal cases against Trump.
A Justice Department official told : "Today...McHenry terminated the employment of a number of (Justice Department) officials who played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump."
"In light of their actions, the Acting Attorney General does not trust these officials to assist in faithfully implementing the President's agenda," the official said.
Smith, who resigned before Trump took office, concluded in a report released this month that the president engaged in an "unprecedented criminal effort" to hold on to power after losing the 2020 election. However, Trump's November election victory thwarted his efforts to bring the case to trial.
Trump's lawyers have called Smith's report politically motivated. The president denies any wrongdoing in the cases, which Smith dropped shortly after Trump's election win.

DOJ's senior career ethics official removed from post, report says

,
Oliver O'Connell
Citing a person familiar with the matter, Reuters reports that the Trump administration has removed the Justice Department's senior career ethics official from his post. The move will likely stoke fears about whether the department can remain insulated from political pressures and conflicts.
The source told Reuters that Bradley Weinsheimer, a department veteran who was appointed associate deputy attorney general during President Donald Trump's first term, was ordered to report to a newly created working group on "sanctuary cities" based in the office of the Associate Attorney General.
When asked earlier on Monday by a Reuters reporter, Weinsheimer declined to comment about the reassignment. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Weinsheimer is among dozens of top career officials who have been reassigned to that office and other posts from areas across the department, including the Civil Rights, National Security, Criminal and Environment and Natural Resources divisions, as well as the Executive Office for Immigration Review.
His reassignment follows the Trump administration's removal of Corey Amundson, the senior career official who ran the section in charge of public corruption and election fraud investigations, and his reassignment to sanctuary cities. According to Justice Department rules, that section must be consulted on all politically sensitive investigations.
Reuters reported earlier on Monday that Amundson had resigned from the Justice Department. His resignation letter did not address his reassignment.
Several current and former Justice Department veterans told Reuters that the removals of Amundson and Weinsheimer together raised serious alarm bells for the department.
Without apolitical career officials in those roles, they said they feared the Trump appointees would be able to launch politically charged investigations and run roughshod over the department's ethics rules to avoid conflicts of interest.
Lisa Murkowski comes out against Trump's Greenland plan

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the moderate Republican from Alaska, put out a statement opposing President Donald Trump's plan to purchase Greenland.
Murkowski put out a statement with Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament that represents Greenland, released a joint statement.
"The appeal of Greenland is easy to understand. It is strategically located for defense, shipping, and more," the joint statement said. "It is also a storehouse for all sorts of minerals, the building blocks of society that will determine who leads-and controls-the industries of the future."
Trump has openly discussed the United States . His son Donald Trump Jr. . Alaska's other senator, Dan Sullivan, also a Republican, told The Independent.
But Murkowski and Chemnitz's statement dismissed the idea.
"As legislators representing Greenland in Denmark and the United States, we see a better path forward. The United States, like Denmark, should recognize that the future will be defined by partnership, not ownership. To ensure our alliance reaches its full potential, Americans must view Greenland as an ally, not an asset. Open for business, but not for sale."
Murkowski has regularly come out to oppose a handful of Trump's initiatives. Most recently, she opposed his nomination of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, alongside fellow moderate Susan Collins. Their opposition, along with that of former majority leader Mitch McConnell, forced Vice President JD Vance to break a tie in the Senate to confirm Hegseth.
