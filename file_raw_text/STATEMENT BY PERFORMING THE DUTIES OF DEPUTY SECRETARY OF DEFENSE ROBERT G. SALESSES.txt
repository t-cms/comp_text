The following information was released by U.S. Department of Defense:
President Trump's charge to the Department is clear: to achieve peace through strength. We will do this by putting forward budgets that revive the warrior ethos, rebuild our military, and reestablish deterrence.
To achieve our mandate from President Trump, we are guided by his priorities including Securing our borders, building the Iron Dome for America, and ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferencing.
Accordingly, Secretary Hegseth has directed a review to identify offsets from the Biden Administration's FY26 budget that could be realigned from low-impact and low-priority Biden-legacy programs to align with President Trump's America First priorities for our national defense.
The Department will develop a list of potential offsets that could be used to fund these priorities, as well as to refocus the Department on its core mission of deterring and winning wars.The offsets are targeted at 8% of the Biden Administration's FY26 budget, totaling around $50 billion, which will then be spent on programs aligned with President Trump's priorities.
The Department of Defense is conducting this review to ensure we are making the best use of the taxpayers' dollars in a way that delivers on the President Trump's defense priorities efficiently and effectively.
Through our budgets, the Department of Defense will once again resource warfighting and cease unnecessary spending that set our military back under the previous administration, including through so-called "climate change"and other woke programs, as well as excessive bureaucracy. The time for preparation is over we must act swiftly to deter current and impending threats and make the best use of taxpayers' dollars in doing so.
