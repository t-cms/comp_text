The Department of Education has created a portal where the public can make complaints about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in K-12 public schools as the Trump administration works to purge DEI from the government.
The Thursday announcement of the “End DEI” portal comes towards the end of the two-week deadline the agency gave K-12 schools and universities  of DEI practices.  
The department says parents, students and others should “submit reports of discrimination based on race or sex in [a] publicly-funded K-12 school.”
“For years, parents have been begging schools to focus on teaching their kids practical skills like reading, writing, and math, instead of pushing critical theory, rogue sex education and divisive ideologies — but their concerns have been brushed off, mocked, or shut down entirely,” Tiffany Justice, the co-founder of Moms for Liberty, said in a press release for the portal on the department’s website.
“Parents, now is the time that you share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools. This webpage demonstrates that President Trump’s Department of Education is putting power back in the hands of parents,” she added. 
The top of the portal form says, “schools should be focused on learning” and has an individual give their name, school name, zip code, a 450 word-limit box to describe the complaint and a spot to attach forms.  
The department says on the form submissions will help guide areas of investigation the agencies should focus on.  
The American Federation of Teachers on Tuesday  over its letter warning schools of investigations and funding cuts if DEI programs are still active on their campuses.  
Last week, a judge  that sought to terminate DEI-related contracts across the executive branch.
