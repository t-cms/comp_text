The following information was released by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton:
Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today released the following statement about the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to become Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services:
"When I met with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I was pleased that he made several commitments to advance President Trump's pro-life, free-market, common-sense agenda. He pledged that hewillcut programs that waste taxpayer dollars on illegal migrants, abortions, DEI, and 'research' aimed at infringing on the rights of gun owners, while prioritizing Medicaid work requirements and respecting the widely used and scientifically based practices of Arkansas farmers. I also appreciate that Mr. Kennedy repeated most of these pledges during his confirmation hearings. I believe Mr. Kennedy will faithfully implement President Trump's agenda and I will therefore support his nomination. I look forward to working with him once confirmed."
