(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Thanks to Jamie Lissow, Joe Machi, Kat Timpf, Tyrus, our studio audience. "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT" is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Trace Gallagher. It's 11:00 p.m. on the East Coast, 8:00 here in Los Angeles, and this is America's late news, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.
And breaking tonight, the Department of Government Efficiency, again, pulling back the magic curtain, and the wizard of DOGE, again, finding a wicked list of inefficiencies, including a very real and very bizarre limestone mine in Pennsylvania, used to process retirement documents for federal workers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELON MUSK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SPACEX, TESLA, AND TWITTER: So, this mine looks like something out of the 50s, because it was started in 1955. So, it looks like -- it's like a time warp.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Or maybe we could borrow that time warp to send members of the media back to an era where it was off limits to go after the children of public figures.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WHOOPI GOLDBERG, HOST, ABC: Elon Musk took his son, X, to a press conference.
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW, ABC: X?
GOLDBERG: I did not name the child. Any who. He took little X to the --
BEHAR: A little -- a little Instagram.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Meantime, New York City officials, accusing the Trump administration of highway robbery for taking back millions of dollars being used to house illegal immigrants in fancy hotels.
Plus, the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine, as President Trump talks to both Putin and Zelenskyy.
But first, the senior national correspondent Kevin Corke, live in D.C. with the latest on DOGE. Kevin, good evening.
KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Trace.
Another day and another round of cuts by the government of -- I think that the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, obviously saving taxpayers a lot of money, and I mean a lot of money, all while raising new questions tonight at today's DOGE subcommittee hearing.
You know, lot of questions like, just how did some of these expenditures end up on the books in the first place? And even more questions about the people who opposed looking into it all.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): The whole D.C. swamp is freaking out that the unelected officials from DOGE were allowed access to these systems. That makes no sense.
Federal judges were not elected, the treasury bureaucrats were not elected, and they have failed to fix the problem that is enabling American taxpayers to be robbed.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CORKE: M-T-G. Still, Democrat lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to focus on, you know, the man behind the examinations, Elon Musk, and a lot less on waste, fraud, and abuse.
And while it is true that Congress maintains the power of the purse, once those funds are allocated to the executive branch and the agencies under its auspices or under the aegis of the executive him or herself, well, you get it, those funds can be distributed on schedule or paused, or maybe even nullified, at least, that's the argument from the administration.
Meantime, the folks over at DOGE are very busy cutting -- oh, how about this? A million dollars for diversity communications campaign. What? And that's just at Ag, how about 4 million over at the Labor Department for DEI consultation services? You got to be kidding me.
All this as DOGE announces it's also looking into that limestone mine in Pennsylvania, where about 700 federal workers process about 10,000 federal retirement applications per month by hand. Incredible, Trace.
GALLAGHER: Kevin Corke, live for us in D.C. Kevin, thank you.
Well, more promises kept tonight as the White House takes back millions in federal funding from New York City, after illegal immigrants were put up at luxury hotels.
Christina Coleman is live with that side of the DOGE story. Christina, good evening.
CHRISTINA COLEMAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, good evening, Trace.
Yes, the Trump administration clawed back more than $80 million in federal funding to house and provide services for migrants in New York City. Mayor Eric Adams says he will discuss the claw back in FEMA funding when he meets with borders czar Tom Homan tomorrow. New York City's comptroller also weighing in.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRAD LANDER, COMPTROLLER, NEW YORK CITY: This was money awarded in the prior administration, spent by the city in the prior administration.
$80.5 million less in our bank account is just $80.5 million that the city doesn't have to meet all the expenses that we have.
COLEMAN (voice over): The Trump administration standing firm in its decision. The homeland security secretary, saying, "I have clawed back the full payment that FEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to New York City migrant hotels. FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations, and was used to house Laken Riley's killer. There will not be a single penny spent that goes against the interests and safety of the American people."
BONDI: NEW York has chosen to prioritize illegal aliens over American citizens. It stops. It stops today.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COLEMAN: Also, a senior DHS official tells Fox News, since February 1st, the daily average of known got aways at the southern border has seen a big drop to 132 a day.
During the all-time highs of the Biden administration in fiscal year 2023, there were more than 1800 got aways every day. A big drop, Trace.
GALLAGHER: Massive. Christina, thank you.
Well, the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT "COMMON SENSE DEPARTMENT", finds it fascinating that CNN, MSNBC, and others are not reporting on the cuts that DOGE is making, or the money DOGE is saving.
Instead, they are reporting on how they believe Elon Musk is lacking transparency.
CNN anchor, Kate Bolduan, said this about Musk, "By definition, he is not being transparent."
"COMMON SENSE" would ask, by whose definition? Because the one that we found defines transparent as clear and easy to see. DOGE has a public tracker, clear and easy to see that gives updates on how much money is being saved. Musk is answering questions almost every day.
We have learned about $1,300 cups of coffee, 150-year-old receiving social security, paying 8,000 percent too much for soap dispensers. And we could list hundreds of other cases of boondoggle-ish behavior. Yet the legacy media is accusing Musk of hiding something. Hiding what?
The left is so defenseless, the ladies on "The View" are mocking Elon's 4- year-old son. During a DOGE subcommittee, a Democrat called Musk a male body part, Anderson Cooper called the former governor of New Hampshire, the same body part.
"COMMON SENSE" finds it interesting that when the left disagrees with Donald Trump, they call him a dictator. And now when they disagree with Elon Musk, they also call him a dictator without the tater.
Let's bring in California GOP chairwoman, Jessica Millan Patterson, the author of "Toxic Empathy" and relatable podcast host, Allie Beth Stuckey; along with former Democratic campaign operative, Evan Barker, thank you all for coming on.
Jessica, to you first. Kristi Noem, posted the following here on X: "I have clawed back the full payment that FEMA deep state activist unilaterally gave to New York City migrant hotels. FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer."
I mean, strip back $80 million, because that's how money -- the much money was actually spent. But, you know, it's a claw back, and they are complaining about it.
JESSICA MILLAN PATTERSON, CHAIRWOMAN, CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY: And Americans were very clear when they voted in November. They voted for this. We had a 95 percent decrease on illegal border crossings when President Trump took office. He took action right away.
When we saw over the last several years, every single state in the country becoming a border state, even thousands of miles away from a border, when New York and Chicago are breaking to the pressures of the migrant crisis, this was a big deal. This is what Americans voted for, promises made, promises kept by the Trump administration.
GALLAGHER: But you have the New York City comptroller, Brad Lander, Allie, saying the following here -- runs about 17 seconds. Watch it. It's worth it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LANDER: I find it terrifying that the federal government had the ability to seize money from us, in a way that we did not know before. Do I understand how it is that Elon Musk was able to get our money back. I don't yet have that clarity. I thought it was important to let you guys know to sound the alarm bell.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: I mean, they sound baffled, Allie, that the federal government wouldn't allow them to fund illegal immigrants who broke federal law.
ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AUTHOR, TOXIC EMPATHY: Trace, I find it far more terrifying that the government can take my taxpayer dollars, send them to New York City to fund the housing and luxury hotels of illegal aliens, one of whom ended up going down to Georgia and murdering Laken Riley
GALLAGHER: Yes.
STUCKEY: I found -- I found that so much more terrifying and disturbing than this amazing endeavor that Elon Musk is undertaken and actually getting back that money, as well as Kristi Noem.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Evan Barker, to you now. California Congressman Robert Garcia, going after Elon Musk by saying the following. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): In the last Congress, Chairwoman Greene, literally showed a dick pic in our oversight congressional hearing. So, I thought I'd bring one as well.
Now, this, of course, we know, is President Elon Musk.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: There it is. The whole dictator without the tater part of that, Evan.
EVAN BARKER, CONTRIBUTOR, FREE PRESS: And what I'll say, Trace, is that this is extremely embarrassing for me, especially being a former Democrat, that this is the way that my party is behaving. When all Elon Musk and DOGE are trying to do is just simply do an audit.
And in fact, they are being incredibly transparent about this audit. They are going on television nearly every single day, doing press conferences, posting on X about it.
You know, the Democrats are just behaving with children at this point. I think that this video shows this as well.
GALLAGHER: Yes. So, the big news is, Tulsi Gabbard is now the DNI. Right? Director of National Intelligence.
Mitch McConnell voted no. Everybody else voted yes, and Republicans, all the Democrats voted no. Mitch McConnell voted no. What do you think?
PATTERSON: Four-time congresswoman. She -- excuse me.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: Oh, I'm sorry -- for Jessica.
PATTERSON: She is very clearly ready and up to the task. She has gone through major scrutiny, and I think that Americans, once again, put forth a very clear vision for what they wanted America to be, and the way that our intelligence community is, is part of that vision, and director Gabbard is certainly up to the task.
GALLAGHER: Yes, you can -- you can take a swing at Mitch McConnell if you want to, Allie.
Washington Post Dan Diamond said the following, quoting here, "Senate Democrats gave themselves only a one in five chance of stopping Kennedy's nomination, according to one democratic staffer involved in the process. But it continues to mystify many doctors, liberal lawmakers, and even some conservatives that Kennedy's confirmation is on the verge of reality."
I mean, Kennedy is tomorrow. And Allie, it looks good.
STUCKEY: Yes, I think this is surprising for a lot of people, even on the conservative side. But for those of us who have been following this Make America Healthy Again movement, which has really gained so much traction, we are not surprised that this is such a high priority of the Trump administration.
And that these congress people are feeling the heat, not just from the Trump admin, but for all of us who voted for President Trump, to carry out the Make America Healthy Again agenda.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: Yes.
STUCKEY: There is no one really better to do that than RFK.
GALLAGHER: Yes. And Evan Barker is a former Democrat. You look at RFK, you look at Kash Patel, they get both of those through. It appears to be almost a clean sweep. Very little the Democrats could do.
BARKER: Very little indeed. And I just want to say I am extremely disappointed in Bernie Sanders, especially for his vote.
Tulsi Gabbard basically sacrificed her future ranks in the Democratic Party to back him.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: Right.
BARKER: And this is how he repays her, is incredibly disappointing.
GALLAGHER: Yes, it's exactly right. It was. And we were going to show the tweet where he came out and he said, she is not all the things you say she is. Back in 2019, she stood by him and he ran from her.
Jessica, Allie, Evan, thank you all.
STUCKEY: Meantime, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, issuing a takedown to the latest anti Trump talking point, that the president's wave of executive orders is triggering a "constitutional crisis".
Ashley Strohmier is live in New York City with the new information on this. Ashley, good evening.
ASHLEY STROHMIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Hi, Trace. If you ask the members of the mainstream media, President Trump, Elon Musk, and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, are not simply trying to trim the fat fraud and abuse in the federal government, they are setting off a full-blown constitutional crisis.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAITLAN COLLINS, ANCHOR, CNN: There are warnings that the U.S. is dangerously close to a constitutional crisis.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are we in a constitutional crisis?
STROHMIER (voice over): And according to The Daily Caller News Foundation, the term constitutional crisis has been used on CNN and MSNBC more than 200 times since DOGE announced it was shuttering USAID on February 3rd.
And just yesterday, Trump said he would, "always abide by the courts," and then appeal their orders if necessary.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, said it's activist judges that are the real problem.
KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The injunctions that have been issued by these judges have no basis in the law and have no grounds.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STROHMIER: And Trace, one could argue the media's latest buzz words, also have no grounds, if the president, as he said, plans to abide by the legal process. Back to you.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Ashley Strohmier, live for us in New York City. Ashley, thank you. Let's bring in Walk Away spokesperson and former Democrat, Natalie Beisner; along with the author of "What's Killing America", Seattle talk radio host Jason Rantz. Welcome to you both.
Jason, to you first. Joe Rogan stood pretty strong for Elon Musk today. He said the following.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE ROGAN, HOST, THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE PODCAST: This other thing about Elon. Elon is going to steal everybody's money. He has $400 billion. I'm telling you, he's not going to steal your money.
Like, wow. We have a brilliant mind that is examining these really -- corrupt and goofy systems, and bringing in a bunch of psychopath wizards.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Yes, say what you want, Jason Rantz, about Elon Musk. He is not going to steal your money.
JASON RANTZ, TALK SHOW HOST, KTTH RADIO SEATTLE: Yes, it's just -- it's so silly. I mean, no one buys this. No one believes this. I know that they are using Elon Musk as the punching bag because all the smears against Donald Trump not only didn't work, but blew up in their faces, but they are going after someone who is relatively popular.
People actually like Elon Musk. And so, going after him for what the sin of trying to cut spending that's out of control, I think is just shining a spotlight on the fact that he is trying to cut spending that's out of control.
GALLAGHER: That's exactly right.
Meantime, Anderson Cooper on CNN, talking with the former New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu, when he said the following.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANDERSON COOPER, ANCHOR, CNN: Some of the details that have come out, like the, you know, $59 million spent on luxury hotels, it's actually not --
GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): FEMA money for migrants. That's OK now?
COOPER: No, I'm not saying it's OK -- I'm not saying it's OK. Don't put words to my mouth.
SUNUNU: So, would you stop that? Would you stop that process?
COOPER: Don't be a -- the portrayal -- what I'm saying is the portrayal by him is just not factually accurate. He is --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Natalie, if I say that to Mike Huckabee, who is -- he would hit me upside the head, rightfully so.
NATALIE BEISNER, SPOKESPERSON, WALK AWAY: Yes, Trace. I think it's another example of TDS, just making people -- he apologized later, and he said, I don't know what happened and I think it's your TDS, Anderson Cooper.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: I don't care.
BEISNER: And then, he tries to make a point that the money all didn't go to luxury hotels, but all of that money went to illegal immigrants.
GALLAGHER: Correct.
BEISNER: And possibly, we -- maybe shouldn't be doing that. Maybe shouldn't be giving millions, no matter what it's going to, to illegal immigrants. And that's the entire point.
GALLAGHER: And the point is they clawed back $80 million, right? We're talking about $59 million.
They clawed back $80 million because they went back and did a little, you know, did a little addition and subtraction, they found it was $80 million.
Here is "The View". They don't really have a comeback for Elon Musk, but they decided to go after Elon Musk's -- his child. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOLDBERG: So, yesterday, Elon Musk, took his son, X, to a press conference.
BEHAR: X?
GOLDBERG: I did not name the child.
BEHAR: That's the --
(CROSSTALK)
GOLDBERG: And I don't want to hear any more mess about our names. OK? OK? Any who. He took little X --
BEHAR: A little -- a little Instagram.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn't own Instagram.
GOLDBERG: He doesn't own Instagram.
BEHAR: I know.
GOLDBERG: He just took little X with him.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: If you watch the rest, Jason, it just nonsensical stuff about Elon Musk and what he's doing, and then, they go after the kid. What do you think?
RANTZ: Yes. So, I'm going to get yelled at for this.
I don't know if he went after -- if they went after the kid, so much as they went after Elon Musk's choice to name his son, X. It's low hanging fruit. It's lazy, it wasn't particularly funny. But I don't think they went over the line here.
I think we can all envision what that might sound like, unfortunately, because the folks at "The View" have done that before.
It was just -- it was unnecessary. I'm not necessarily outraged by it.
GALLAGHER: Yes.
RANTZ: But I do think that it was completely unnecessary. They don't know what else to say. So, they're going after something that they think is easy to go after, and it just shows you how truly lazy and uninspired they are.
GALLAGHER: Yes, fair enough. Meantime, Karoline Leavitt talked about what she believes is the true constitutional crisis, Natalie. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEAVITT: In fact, the real constitutional crisis is taking place within our judicial branch, where district court judges and liberal districts across the country are abusing their power to unilaterally block President Trump's basic executive authority.
We believe these judges are acting as judicial activists, rather than honest arbiters of the law.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Yes. I mean, she makes a better point than the Democrats who were saying that, you know, Trump and Elon are causing a constitutional crisis. What do you think?
BEISNER: I mean, this is just another example of the hypocrisy. AOC in 2023 is told Biden that he should ignore a Texas federal judge regarding the abortion pill, and Biden's HHS secretary said that, well, they might actually ignore it. And these are the Democrats that want to pack the Court.
I mean, they don't actually care about a constitutional crisis. Is just another lie to get everyone all emotional as usual.
GALLAGHER: Yes. And it works.
BEISNER: Yes.
GALLAGHER: Natalie, Jason Rantz, thank you both.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think President Putin wants peace, and President Zelenskyy wants peace, and I want peace. I just want to see people stop getting killed.
I'm back in Ukraine. I'm back in Ukraine. Don't say that. I'm approving, but I do want security for our money.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Let's bring in Marine veteran Chad Robichaux from the Mighty Oaks Foundation. Chad, great to have you on the show.
It really sounds like these negotiations could lead to the possibility of a peace deal. I mean, they are going as far as we've seen them go in the better part of three years.
CHAD ROBICHAUX, FOUNDER, MIGHTY OAKS FOUNDATION: Yes, for sure. I mean, look, President Trump said it in the -- in the presidential debate, that even as president-elect, he would -- he would find to -- find a peace deal. And we've seen that right away.
I mean, when he said that at a debate stage, you had a response from Putin, you had a response from Zelenskyy. And here we are, you know, two weeks into President Trump's administration, and we're seeing a potential peace deal.
The Ukrainian war should never happen. It would not have happened if President Trump was in office. This was allowed to take place because of President Biden's weakness in Afghanistan and president -- and Putin took advantage of it. And now, over a million people have died. It needs to end.
GALLAGHER: Yes, and, you know it's kind of one of those things where you look at both sides, and you look at the chess board over there, and you look at this. This is the Zelenskyy X post from today, and it says, quoting here, "No one wants peace more than Ukraine. Together with the U.S., we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. As President Trump said, let's get it done. We agreed to maintain further contact and plan upcoming meetings."
I mean, Pete Hegseth has already said, Ukraine would have to give up some territory here. So, Zelenskyy, even knowing that is still talking peace, it sounds like there is -- it sounds like there is desire on both sides.
ROBICHAUX: There is. Didn't look -- I've been to Ukraine over 10 times in the last few years, since all this has started. I've been on the front lines with the people there, people that have lost, you know, their family members and no one wants peace more than them. They lost everything.
And some of those areas, like Crimea are already lost to the Russians. And no one wants to give up territory, but it's going to -- in order to have peace. And Secretary Pete Hegseth said this, they are going to have to give up some territory. This is not going to be a 2014 border, and it is unfortunate, but some of the people there are agreeing with it anyways.
GALLAGHER: While I've got you, Chad, I wanted to get your take on one of the big stories today.
Here is Chuck Schumer on the Democratic opposition to Tulsi Gabbard.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Every single Democrat, I am proud to say, will oppose the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard, because we simply cannot, in good conscience, trust our most classified secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for conspiracy theories.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: He is proud that every Democrat voted no against a former Democrat.
ROBICHAUX: Thankfully, no one cares what he has to say. Chuck Schumer and his den of thieves have been exposed. The American people see right through them. They are desperate. They will do anything to stop what President Trump is doing. And President Trump is doing exactly what the American people elected him to do, to make America safe, secure, healthy, be the world economic leader, and bring a government accountability to return it to the people.
And we the people have spoken. We want Tulsi Gabbard in. I can tell you, our service members want Tulsi Gabbard in to be the Director of National Intelligence for the CIA, DIA, and NSA.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: Yes.
ROBICHAUX: She is the right person for the job. She is a patriot.
GALLAGHER: Yes.
ROBICHAUX: And, by the way, I think one of the most things outside of her being a uniform in combat, she is one of the few people in Washington, D.C. that stood up against a political party and partisanship to do with American people wanted. In 2020, they ousted her for it.
(CROSSTALK)
GALLAGHER: Right. Yes. Chad Robichaux, great to have you on the show as always. Thank you, sir.
Coming up, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT hits the streets in D.C. to talk DOGE. What they think about the crackdown on government waste might surprise you.
And later in the "NIGHTCAP".
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Constitutional crisis.
COLLINS: Constitutional crisis.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A constitutional crisis.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Democrats in the legacy media, stoking fear across the nation by calling President Trump's executive actions a constitutional crisis. What do you think? Do you believe we're approaching a constitutional crisis? Is anybody buying this? Let us know. X and Instagram @tracegallagher. We'll read your responses coming up later in the "NIGHTCAP".
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GALLAGHER: Well, Elon Musk, now finding out that FEMA reportedly spent millions on luxury hotels for illegal immigrants, after Democrats insisted it was not true. Many of you were both shocked and thankful at what Musk uncovered. But what does D.C. think? We sent Jilly (PH) back into the swamp to get a temperature check, and it was not pretty.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What are your thoughts on Elon Musk?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I like what she did with Tesla. I think he's a crook.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he's got to go. He is a threat to the nation.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He makes too much god damn money.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is putting aside all of the law that we have to fill his own agenda.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's his own agenda?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is trying to get more power in the executive branch.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is disgusting.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right. How is he getting more power to the executive branch?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is not following the process that's outlined in the Constitution.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think the federal government should prioritize its citizens over illegals -- immigrants?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think that I accept the premise of the question.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elon Musk doesn't care. He is in China right now. He is in -- he is -- he is advocating --
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is actually here in Washington, D.C.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. I know, right now -- right now. Yes, because he is a government contractor.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elon Musk recently discovered, just last week, FEMA designated $59 million towards illegal immigrants.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I'm not going to talk about this, and I don't know who you are, so, I'm not talking to you.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is that fair?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nothing is fair unless you really go out and get it or steal it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Totally unfair. I mean, sorry, we have to follow the rules.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thoughts on Elon Musk?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not a fan.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why? Donald Trump ran on making the government more efficient with Elon Musk, with Elon Musk by his side. The people elected Donald Trump and Elon Musk.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you say about Project 2025?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What are your thoughts on Elon Musk?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not a fan.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why? I feel like you've interviewed me before.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Playing both, like half his presidency so far because he isn't running this stuff.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think Joe Biden spent a lot of time on vacation?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was not elected to anything he is a South African apartheid.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Well, the first house subcommittee hearing on DOGE came to order today, and Democrats use the majority of their time to attack Elon Musk. Let's bring in a Republican member of that DOGE subcommittee, Texas Representative Pat Fallon. Congressman, it's great to have you on the show. Your fellow Texas resident, Jasmine Crockett, democrat, said the following today. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASMINE CROCKETT, TEXAS RESIDENT: I'm trying to figure out exactly what it is that the Republicans believe our job is, because right now they have relinquished their constitutional duties over to in unelected bureaucrats.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Relinquished your constitutional duty, sir.
REP. PAT FALLON (R-TX): You know what, Trace, it's just getting tired. Listen, Democrats can't get through their five minutes statements on committee without saying either oligarch, billionaire, unelected billionaire, or Elon Musk. They have Elon Musk derangement syndrome. The fact of the matter is when you're wasting -- we've burned in the last 20 years up to 2.7 trillion with, a T, dollars on improper payments to folks. We've got to do something about it. 764 billion just under the Biden administration.
And finally, finally we're taking bold action under President Trump's leadership. Republicans on the Hill. We're doing something about it. We're not talking about it anymore.
GALLAGHER: One more, one more soundbite from the gathering today. Here is Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): A wrecking crew, a wrecking crane, a wrecking ball is not going to do it. And we're not going to support that approach to waste, fraud and abuse from the federal government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: I think the wrecking ball is actually working. It's paying dividends.
FALLON: I think that's what we need. When you find out that there were $250 billion stolen during COVID, and we recruit $5 billion of it, yes, it's time to actually make people prove that they deserve the benefits or they're eligible, I should say, for the benefits of federal government offers -- not just take their work for it in the honor system. Because the honor system is really costly to the American taxpayer.
GALLAGHER: And Elon Musk said this about people, people saying that he is not transparent. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELON MUSK, TESLA CEO: Transparency is what builds trust, not simply somebody asserting trust. So, not somebody saying they're trustworthy, but transparency so you can see everything that's going on. And you can see am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: I mean like, like common sense, we could not figure out a way to see somebody more transparent than Elon Musk.
FALLON: Yes, we all know who he is, what he's done, he's a genius, certifiable. And every, you know, a couple centuries, somebody this brilliant comes along, and guess what, he's going to work for free to help us save money and the American taxpayers are going to finally get a bang for the buck and let's go. Anybody out there that thinks the federal government is working at maximum efficiency will sell you a bridge in Brooklyn, and you know what, they're in orbit around Neptune.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Congressman Pat Fallon, thank you, sir.
FALLON: Thanks, Trace. God bless. Take care.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE WITKOFF, SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST: This, sort of, secret sauce when you work with, with President Trump, it's hard for me to describe, but everybody operates in the same way. It's this can-do atmosphere, and we're all out there to get it done.
(END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: The president's going a major diplomatic victory with the release of American prisoner, Marc Fogel, from a Russian prison. It comes six months after the teacher from Pennsylvania told his family he felt like his, quoting here, "soul is dead," following his exclusion from a Biden administration prisoner swap. Let's bring in a refugee from the former Soviet Union, Stop Anti-Semitism Founder Liora Rez. Liora, great to have you on the show. I want to play a soundbite. We're going back here to August, where Joe Biden was answering a question about Marc Fogel being in Russia, still. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In a Russian prison Is still Marc Fogel, the Pennsylvania teacher. He's still in a Russian prison.
JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: We're not giving up, we're not giving up on that.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What more can you do? What more can you do?
BIDEN: You want me to tell you ahead of time, so it doesn't get out?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: I mean, we could play different soundbites from the Biden administration. Nobody would say anything about it. And they really didn't do anything about it either, Liora.
LIORA REZ, ANTI-SEMITISM FOUNDER: It's infuriating, especially to watch this. And when that soundbite came out where Marc said, you know, my, my soul is dead. It's just heartbreaking to hear that, specifically when we still have U.S. citizens being held hostage in Gaza as you and I talked tonight. We have Eden Alexander from New Jersey, and we have Sagi Dekkelhen from Connecticut being held in the hells of Gaza by Hamas terrorists. So, we're so thankful that Mr. Fogel was home. We're so happy for his family. And we applaud President Trump and the administration and Steve Witkoff for getting it done.
GALLAGHER: Yes, I want to kind of switch to Russia if I can very quickly. Trump talked with both Putin and Zelenskyy today, and he had this to say.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: We had a great call, and it lasted for a long time, over an hour this morning. I also had with President Zelenskyy, a very good call, after that. And I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelenskyy wants peace, and I want peace.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Rarely does a president talk to leaders that are at odds, that are at war on the same day. It may not be anything but boy it sure sounds like it is optimistic.
REZ: I certainly hope that it's the first of many steps towards peace like the President had just said. Every single one of us is completely sick and tired of the bloodshed whether it's Russia, Ukraine or in Israel. We've just had it. It's -- enough is enough. There's so many innocent lives lost -- women, children, and again we hope that this is the first of many steps towards that.
GALLAGHER: I know you know Russia. I've got about 10 seconds for you, but what do you think about the living conditions in Russia right now?
REZ: So, what Marc Fogel went through, again, I can't even imagine, I mean he was in a Russian penal colony since, you know, 2021. And again, just hearing his voice where he said my soul is dead, that's just -- it rips at your heartstrings. And again, we're just so happy he's home and out of Russia.
GALLAGHER: Yes, and his family as well. Liora Rez, great to have you on as always. Thank you.
Well, coming up, a Massachusetts town votes to become a transgender sanctuary city. The Wild City Council meeting is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GALLAGHER: Well, the Trump administration now wrapping up its war on woke. Let's bring in PragerU Kids Host and Outreach Director, Jill Simonian; along with podcast host and political commentator, Noelle Fitchett. Thank you both for coming on. So, Randi Weingarten, the President of the American Federation of Teachers protesting Lin McMahon, the whole, you know, Department of Education had this to say today. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: What is now coming down the pike in this aura of efficiency, it's not efficiency, it's a desolation. It is an attempt to take the funding and take the rights away from each and every child.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: The union that shut down the schools during COVID is now complaining about somebody taking rights away from children, Jill?
JILL SIMONIAN, PRAGERU KIDS HOST AND OUTREACH DIRECTOR: Pardon me for laughing, Trace, but I cannot help but laugh at this because the Department of Education has been failing students and families across this nation for decades. I mean, since I was literally in kindergarten many, many years ago, don't do the math.
On the Web site of the Department of Ed, and I brought my notes because I wanted to be precise, it says they foster global competitiveness, they want to complement the efforts of the schools, and they want to encourage parent involvement.
Randi Weingarten and the teacher unions of this nation are literally doing the opposite of that, and proficiency scores have been plummeting so that less than half of students K through 12 are proficient in math and English. It's a shame. It's a failure.
GALLAGHER: It is. It is a failure. Noelle, to you, here are some people in Worcester, Mass., pushing to be a transgender sanctuary city. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't want to spend an hour applying glitter on my face so that you will hear and see me.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I need the city to protect me because the federal government won't and if you think you're afraid of Trump, you should see how afraid of Trump I am.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It demands a response from our elected officials to say we recognize that you are under attack, and in Worcester, we are going to protect you.
(END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: They got their wish, but it's not like that ICE is going to come. What do you think?
NOELLE FITCHETT, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, I think it's so interesting that they, I'm curious what they're so afraid of, and what they're afraid of happening. The majority of Americans agree that minorities, that minors, should not undergo any sort of sex change. I mean, that's just common sense policy. So, are they against that? Do they think that it's OK for minors to be able to change their gender when they can't even drink alcohol? It makes zero sense. And so, it's really interesting.
GALLAGHER: Yes, they can't get an aspirin without the school calling the parents saying, can I give your kid an aspirin? Axios writes the following here, exclusive Disney making changes to its DEI efforts, "Disney changing its diversity, equity and inclusion programs to focus more closely on business outcomes." Who knew Disney wanted to make money?
SIMONIAN: Who knew that we would see a return to merit and results? I mean the fact that they are reversing and walking back everything that they just, you know, fought for the last four years proves that DEI has been an abject fail, a certified failure on so many levels for them, profit-wise and audiences. Parents want wholesome entertainment and experiences for our kids. Return to merit, return to truth. This is good.
GALLAGHER: Yes, Disney changing content warnings ahead of movies like Dumbo and Peter Pan. Variety says the following, "Disney is changing the disclaimer that auto-plays before these titles. The previous version noted that the film includes negative depictions and or mistreatment of peoples or cultures while the new version reads this program is presented as originally created and may contain stereotypes or negative depictions."
In other words. they're saying it might offend you but deal with it, right? So, Disney has kind of gone the other side like you know what it's, it's fine.
FITCHETT: Yes, absolutely. I mean, there's not going to be a trigger warning for everything in life. We need to be able to just see things and not be offended by it every two seconds. And DEI is terrible. I mean, me as a minority, I don't want to be hired or recognized because of the way that I look, but rather for merit. And so, I'm glad that DEI is going away because it absolutely helps no one.
GALLAGHER: Yes. Noelle, Jill, thank you both.
SIMONIAN: You're welcome.
GALLAGHER: Well, Democrats in the legacy media calling President Trump's executive actions a "constitutional crisis." What do you think? Is anybody buying this? Let us know, X and Instagram, @TraceGallagher. We're back with the "NIGHTCAP" crew, including you next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GALLAGHER: We are back with the "NIGHTCAP" crew: Kevin Corke, Christina Coleman, Ashley Strohmier, Jason Rance, Jill Simonian, and Natalie Beisner. Tonight's topic, constitutional crisis. Democrats in the legacy media stoking fear across the nation by calling President Trump's executive actions a constitutional crisis. Do you believe we are approaching such a thing? Are you buying this, Jason Rantz?
RANTZ: I am now because Senator Chris Murphy. He said, in the said interview, we've got democracy hanging on by a thread. And the constitutional crisis, I don't know how that threat holds, and I'm terrified.
GALLAGHER: I'm with you. Murphy is that man you think, oh, if he said it, then it's definitely true. Christina.
COLEMAN: No, I don't believe it's a constitutional crisis. And if Democrats continue act like the sky is falling and it's the end of the world, no one is ever going to take them seriously.
GALLAGHER: Ashley Strohmier.
STROHMIER: Yes, following up on what Christina said, I don't think anyone does take them seriously. And anytime CNN says something more than 200 times and MSNBC in the course of weeks, you just don't need to listen. Just turn the other way.
GALLAGHER: Yes, we did a reporting on the call that happens. Media people get on this call on Sunday afternoon, they get kind of the talking points. And when you hear constitutional crisis, Kevin Corke, a thousand times in the week, you're like, well, they were on the call.
CORKE: I know those calls very well. That's exactly how it plays out. And no, nobody believes them at this point.
GALLAGHER: Yes, it's kind of incredible.
CORKE: No really.
GALLAGHER: Not really. Natalie Beisner.
BEISNER: As a former Democrat, I used to buy it, but now I'm not buying it. You know this is also Biden who bragged about the fact that the Supreme Court couldn't stop him from handing out federal student loan forgiveness. So, no, I mean, it's -- they react one way to Trump and one way to everyone else, and it's not a constitutional thing.
GALLAGHER: And it's kind of funny, Jill, because, you know, we really did that. We did a common sense on this thing where Joe Biden said a couple of times it was affirmative action. He's like, we -- this cannot be the final word. Well, actually, the Supreme Court is the final word. What do you think?
SIMONIAN: The biggest constitutional crisis there is, is that most Americans have not read the constitution. So, for all of the people screaming constitutional crisis guess what we have resources at PragerUKids.com for free.
GALLAGHER: There's the -- Jill got her plug in, thank goodness for that. We asked the audience what you think.
April says, "Anyone that has read and understood the constitution knows they are lying."
Melody says, "Probably not anyone watching Fox News!" Although more Independents and Democrats watch Fox News than any other cable news channel.
Tammy, "Of course, no one is buying this. What I want to know is who's sending out the memo so that all are using the same talking points." The call is sending it out on Sunday afternoon.
Bruce, "I don't buy it. I can't buy it. USAID spent all of our money."
And Shemron says, "Absolutely not. Trump is fixing this country and has achieved more than any other president."
Sean says, "Yes, a constitutional crisis is occurring because people believe the garbage spewed by the liberal media."
Tommy says, "We the people voted for this. There is no crisis, period." And many others have kind of echoed that.
And finally, Michael says, "Undoing all of Biden's messes is not a constitutional crisis. It's actually quite the opposite."
And thank you all for joining the "NIGHTCAP," thank you for watching America's late news, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles. See you back here tomorrow.
