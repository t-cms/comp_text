SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: As always, thank you for being with us. Thank you for making this show possible. Please set your DVR, so you never, ever, ever, ever miss an episode of Hannity. In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Guess what? Greg Gutfeld is standing by to put a smile on your face. Have a great night.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: OK. OK. OK. All right, all right, all right. I expect nothing less. Happy Tuesday, everyone. So, Elon Musk and DOGE discovered that there are millions of dead Americans collecting Social Security payments, and they trace one payment to a home in Delaware. They also found out that the government was sending a Social Security check to a man listed as 360 years old. Here's a picture of that man.
Meanwhile, millions of Americans in the Social Security database are between the ages of 101 and 159, while others are twice that age. And not surprisingly, they spend all their social security checks on the same thing. Did all that for one ad. They're not even paying us. OK, a truck overturned on a Florida Highway and spilled 44,000 pounds of beer. What? No pretzels? Asked one man. But, to clean up an alcohol spill of that size, Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis called in an expert.
Love that picture. Speaking Kamala over the weekend, the former VP attended two Broadway shows. Yeah, two Broadway shows. It's part of her new strategy to gain popularity with straight working class males. That's funny. After a failed woke rebrand, Playboy has returned to showing actual real naked women. For those -- for those who still want to see a naked trans person, you'll have to hit me up later.
According to a study, Republicans are having way more kids than Democrats. They credit this outcome to a moment when one man switched parties. Trump announced there aren't going to be any more drag shows at the Kennedy Center. So now, if you want to watch men in dresses singing, you will have to go see Taylor Swift. Unnecessary. An MSNBC guest called on the U.S. to cancel Presidents Day in protest of Trump. Meanwhile, we're canceling Halloween to protest Joy Reid.
Finally, an 81-year-old sex professor says the key to sex is to ask the right question. The number one question that he hears most is, why is that purple? I thought about not putting that in the show. Too late. All right. So remember the good old days when Trump was a threat to Democracy?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LIZ CHENEY, AMERICAN ATTORNEY AND REPUBLICAN POLITICIAN: Donald Trump presents a challenge and a threat fundamentally to the Republic.
KAMALA HARRIS, ATTORNEY AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Donald Trump is an existential threat to our Democracy.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't give them the power. Look, are they a threat to Democracy? Yes.
CHRIS MURPHY, UNITED STATES SENATOR: Donald Trump presents an existential threat to Democracy.
JOE BIDEN, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Biggest threat to our Democracy in American history.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A person who is a threat to our Democracy.
HARRIS: We are fighting for a Democracy.
BIDEN: He is a genuine threat to our Democracy. And that's not hyperbole.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Well, that age about as well as my timeshare on Epstein Island. Because it turns out, when it comes to Democracy, Americans don't see Trump as a threat at all. Yougov.com asks which issues are Americans most likely to trust Trump to handle as President? And they trust him on almost everything. On immigration, over 60 percent trust him at least a little bit, which is about how much I trust Jim Acosta when he was driving my Uber.
Trump gets similar numbers on the economy, foreign policy and crime. But what about Democracy? The thing hyperventilating Democrats keep saying he's going to destroy. Even then, 38 percent trust him a lot, and 17 percent trust him a little. That's 55 percent, Kat. I'm singling you out for no reason at all.
KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. You're admitting now.
GUTFELD: To put that in perspective, most Americans couldn't even trust Joe Biden to put his shoes on the right feet. Now, keep in mind, these people who trust Trump aren't starry-eyed fans. Take this panel of CNN voters who supported Biden in 2020, who much to CNN chagrin, love what Trump is doing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DANA BASH, NEWS ANCHOR, CNN: Our friends at, engages, talked to some Arizona voters who switched from voting for Joe Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024, and so far, they mostly like what they see.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just think he's trying to get America back on track as quickly as possible.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Feels more married and transparency that I'm getting from the administration so far.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I approve of a lot of the stuff that he's doing with the border and everything.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But the most part, I feel like he's -- he's on the right track.
BASH: All 11 Biden Trump voters say they approve of Donald Trump's first weeks in office.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Poor Dana having to spit those words out. I haven't seen someone regret their words so deeply since Abe Lincoln said, is this seat taken?
TIMPF: Too soon?
GUTFELD: Yeah, too soon. It's got a great, great grand cousin who's upset. Write your letters, but it sucks for Dana Bash, because none of those voters are typical Trumpers. You never catch those voters in a MAGA hat. They probably never even been to a NASCAR race. Neither have I, but that's only because Danica Patrick took out that restraining order. The shock over at CNN continues. Listen to the anchors reaction when Frank Luntz tells her that former Hillary supporters like what Trump is doing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRIANNA KEILAR, CO-ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL: You have been speaking with a number of voters who were Hillary Clinton 2016, Joe Biden 2020, and then, went for Trump in 2024, how are these folks seeing the early days of Trump's second term?
FRANK LUNTZ, AMERICAN CONSULTANT: Pretty well.
KEILAR: Really?
LUNTZ: And they're reacting to it because they love the pace of change. They were very fed up over the last four years. They wanted action. They wanted results. They looked at prices, they looked at affordability, looked at immigration, and they didn't see anything happening. They still don't like what he says, but they like what he does.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Someone call animal control. Get that thing on Frank's head neutered. We can't let it reproduce. But you heard what Frank said, right? Quote, they don't like what he says, but they like what he does. Let's cue the call back.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Trump's sound is blunt, raw to some scary, but his deeds are primarily in the service of the country. If you don't like his words, just follow his deeds, because those are music to my ears. So, what if he tweets, and there's always this kind of underlying, underlying chaos and conflict. If somebody is right on the big picture, it doesn't matter. And if you have your -- if you have problems with Trump's character or his jokes or the way he acts, concentrate on what he does.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: My face is like that little rubber stress ball, but it's like, I'm Nostradamus with six pack abs, and that you go poll backs it up. Despite some people not liking Trump, they trust him to do what's right, which is fine, because he's your President, not somebody you're trying to (BEEP) on Tinder. I apologize, because it's all about deeds, not words. Trump recognized it too.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I think Tucker Carlson and Laura and Jesse Watters and Janine, we have a lot of great people, even Greg Gutfeld, he wasn't good to me two years ago, now he sees all I've done. He said, would you rather have a great President or a nice guy? I don't know, I think I'm a nice guy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Just reminds me of Joe Pesci when he does that, but that's another thing I like about him. He has great taste in pundits. So, as the Democrats steered their party off a cliff, they're still screaming fascist all the way down. Meanwhile, most voters shrug it off where they're able to separate whatever personal feelings about Trump from the recognition of the things he's getting done. Sure, maybe you think he's a jerk, but a lot of people feel that way about your husband, and yet you're still happy to spend the money he makes on that stupid (BEEP) candles and decorative bowls.
Oh, don't put your keys in the bowl. It's for decoration. And maybe you even think that about me, that I'm a jerk. I suppose anything's possible, but that's your right as an American, unless you're an illegal, in which case, clean my pool and then get out of here before Tom Homan shows up. But now that Trump is actually following up on his campaign promises, a lot of people are deciding they don't care about his personal flaws. They're willing to accept the whole package, because he's undoing much of the damage the Dems have caused. He's like a bull in a China shop, except in reverse.
He's putting the pieces back together. And unlike Kamala and the Democrats, he's not sniffing the glue. Look, you don't need to worship Trump to support him. You don't even need to like him to like what he does, because that doesn't make you a Republican. It just makes you an adult.
Let's welcome tonight's guests. He'll risk his career to speak without fear; star of the new movie, The Unbreakable Boy, Zachary Levi. Whoever thinks life is short has never seen his act; actor, writer and comedian, Jamie Lissow. This guy used to pack heat, now his opinions can't be beat; Fox News contributor, Paul Mauro. And her baby is taking longer to come out than John (inaudible) New York Times Bestselling author and Fox News contributor, Kat Timpf. Zach, welcome to the show.
ZACHARY LEVI, AMERICAN ACTOR, STAR OF THE NEW MOVIE, THE UNBREAKABLE BOY: Thank you.
GUTFELD: You look great.
LEVI: Thanks. I'm trying.
GUTFELD: No, you don't have to try. That's what I hate about you. You come from an industry where this has to be like a bombshell every day, right? Trump's doing something, doing something, doing something, and you were you out like, just remain calm. You know, do you ever try to explain Trump's appeal to people who still can't handle it?
LEVI: Absolutely. I mean, I try to engage in good profitable conversation all the time. I try to do that in real life. I try to do that with friends and family. I try to do that on social media. It's difficult. Social media is a very interesting and quite often toxic place, but I still attempt to lead with love and talk to people about their concerns. I understand that. We have to have empathy with people.
I think, right now, we're applying a tremendous amount of logic and reason to a big problem and all of the darkness, and the corruption and everything that's been going on for far too long. We must try to balance that with some empathy along the way, and see that there are people, people that voted differently than us, but they are still human beings and children of God, and we must love them, and we must all try to move forward in that as much as we can. You know.
GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, it's funny. Thank you. Hold your applause for my response, but you're right. It's just the problem is, I think the people that we're talking about would listen to you, or a lot of them are, because they're still pissed off.
LEVI: Maybe, but that -- again, I can't -- I can't, none of us can control anybody else's emotions or their triggers to certain things, and we should never try, but to the extent that we can at least hold our ground firmly. But again, in a -- in a kindness, and an understanding, like, I think it's -- I think it's folly when we see other people reacting and being snotty and (BEEP), and jaded and whatever it is, if we allow that to then inform how we react to them, we're losing in the same game. You know, you try, you try.
GUTFELD: There goes my show of I ever did that. You know, Jamie, we're talking about words versus deeds. Unfortunately, for you, your words are terrible, and you've done nothing productive in your life.
JAMIE LISSOW, ACTOR, WRITER AND COMEDIAN: Yeah, that's very funny. I've also never felt less good-looking than since you sat me next to Zach.
GUTFELD: Isn't it weird how New York has a different standard of hands on this, and then like, LA? It's like, you're -- you're pretty good-looking for New York, but now you're like a three.
LISSOW: Dude, I was on a carnival cruise ship a couple weeks ago. I was like an eight.
LEVI: You're a ton to me, bro, you're a ton to me. Yeah.
LISSOW: Yeah. I think people are just seeing that Trump actually does what he says, he's going to do with a Biden Administration. I haven't seen less follow-through since my wedding vows. I should have known something was going to go wrong during my -- during my wedding, I was thinking back the idea, I remember her going, I'll be with you for good times, and that's it.
But, good for Trump that I think this is all very exciting. I think it's good that America, they're not stupid, they're watching good things happen, and he's actually coming. I mean, look at Biden's -- at the end of Biden's presidency, I looked it up, his approval rating was down to friends and family. And then, I also heard from a pretty good source that if a friend or something would come up to him and interrupt him and go, pardon me, he would go, OK, sure.
GUTFELD: Paul, do you remember sometime in, like, 2015 at the West Side Steak House, when you were trying to convince me to vote for Trump? And I stood up and I left the bar angry. I was out -- we were outside, and I walked off down 40th, down 10 Avenue, I was that emotional type.
PAUL MAURO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You were an asshole.
GUTFELD: Yeah. I was an asshole. True. I was, emotional asshole.
MAURO: You came around. Look, what could be more delicious than watching the left the media have to spit out the fact, it's like watching your ex do a lot better than you are doing, right? Wow, you married a billionaire. Oh, and I'm sitting on working at McDonald's. They can't believe it's going away. And the reason is, and Jamie hit on, you know, it's -- there's no zeal like a convert, right? And they're not used to the fact that, OK, they signed on with this guy, and he's doing it, like he's doing what he said he was going to, like, when do you see that in politics, right?
The guy says, I'm going to do A, B, C, D, before his ass hits the seat, he's doing it. And, you know, look, OK, there's going to be some down, you know, it's like, when you go on a new website, right? Do you accept the cookies? Yeah, you hit it. You have really no idea what the hell you just bought into, right? And you just -- and they're seeing some of that, you know. But the bottom line is, he's doing what he said he was going to do, and so I don't know they're going to get it's 52 percent of the population on the election day. Right now, what? He's in 60s on these issues? I don't know that they come back.
So, you and I've talked about this, they're in real trouble here, because he's really winning. I mean, everything he promised in the first term, it's really coming to fruition. I don't know what the hell they're doing. So as a result, they yell, and that's not really convincing.
GUTFELD: Yeah. Kat, I think it's safe to say that your -- your baby has an opinion by now.
TIMPF: Yeah.
MAURO: This baby votes.
GUTFELD: So, the baby has been on so many shows.
TIMPF: I know.
GUTFELD: All right, what do you think the -- what do you think the baby -- how the baby views this? Where is the baby's stand on Trump?
TIMPF: I think the baby just like, really likes me, and then, I think it wants to come out, and then, and then it like, hears you talk, and it's like.
MAURO: So, the baby agrees with me.
TIMPF: Yeah. I hesitate to talk about the baby, because then I get like, the man, some of the stuff people feel comfortable saying to you when you're pregnant is wild.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: I had someone email me seven times about my amniotic fluid, and then, they were like, why aren't you replying? Why aren't you replying? Because information about any of my fluids are on a basis where I'll tell you first, if I want you to know.
GUTFELD: You're supposed to have changed it every six months.
TIMPF: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. They acted like I didn't know that. I'm going to get emails about that. So, I can steer this in a direction that will save us both. I think that it was the understatement of made that I've heard of recently at all, none bigger than this, the person they had on CNN that said that he's more transparent than what happened before. Because, Trump is maybe a little too transparent, sometimes like that, that's what can get him in troubles.
I think he says things before he's really sure if he thinks it or not. He's kind of like just to test drive this idea, as opposed to the other guy that we just like weren't allowed to hear talk, because that's ultimately what happened to Biden's candidacy, is that, too many people heard him talk. Because none of -- nobody who, like, watches Fox was shocked to see what happened at the debate, because that's the kind of clips that we were playing on this network.
But people had not seen that before. And then they were, like, OK, yeah, that was -- we would not -- we have this lady like you. You guys love this lady, yeah. And I feel like a lot of people were like, what are you talking about? And I think you really can't overstate what a big impact that had on a lot of people.
GUTFELD: I think you're correct. Now, we must move on. It's causing liberal insanity watching Trump-Elon in Hannity.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Doves in the dawn pay a visit to Sean. Our Video of The Day comes to us from a show hosted by a young up and comer, Sean Hannity. Moments ago, we saw his exclusive interview with President Trump and Elon Musk, but in case you missed it, we've got some highlights. I mean, just imagine if you sued Twitter a number of years ago, and you just made him pay $10 million.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: You sued Twitter a number of years ago, you just made him pay you $10 million?
TRUMP: That's right. I sued from long before he had it.
ELON MUSK, CEO OF TESLA MOTORS: Yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: And, I mean, they really did a number on me, you know, and I sued, and they had to pay, they paid $10 million settlement. I was looking to get much more money than that.
HANNITY: So, you gave him a discount when the law --
TRUMP: He got a big discount, I don't think he even knows about it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Wow. I wonder if something that had an effect on him was when he saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like a beautiful little baby.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby. You grab, you have a baby. It just --
MUSK: Hug the rocket.
TRUMP: I've never seen --
MUSL: Everybody (CROSSTALK) clean rockets in there.
TRUMP: Yeah, no, but, and he said, you know, you can't, we have a rocket program if you're going to dump $1 billion into the ocean every time you fly, you have to save it. And he saved it, the first time that I've ever seen that done. Now nobody else can do it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Makes me think if Trump ever writes a beautiful executive order and you sign it, and you assume it's going to be done, but it's not.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: You write a beautiful executive and you sign it and you assume it's going to be done, but it's not. What he does is, he takes it and with his 100 geniuses, he's got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him actually, they dress just t-shirt. You wouldn't know, they have 180.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: It was quite an interview, and this was a big risk for Hannity. Most people that sit down with both Trump and Musk end up pregnant. Jamie, we had to cut down that full interview. It's kind of like your wife cut you out of your own family. What did you make of -- what did you make of it?
LISSOW: Well, I don't know. I don't think, first of all, I love Trump, but I don't think you're supposed to grab babies like that. I don't know who is throwing him a baby. I like seeing them together. I like them seeming like normal people having a normal conversation, but actually getting things done. And dude, the Elon rocket thing, I don't think that occurred to any - - he has re imagined the whole lighting off a rock, like he mentioned back in the day, like someone let off a rock, and you like, there it is, it's up there, and then someone goes, oh, cool. What are we doing now? And they go, I don't know.
I guess, it just smashes to the ground, like, it's amazing. And I know I always bring it back this, but that Elon catching that rocket, that also reminded me of my marriage. But when the rocket came down, there's actually one in there already. And, yeah, but -- but isn't it, though? But isn't it kind of refreshing that they can take shots each other? And I don't know, I just think that we need just -- just normal people sometimes just saying what's on their mind without all this type of editing.
GUTFELD: Well, you know, Zach, this is what interests me about this interview is, Trump -- Trump is like the big dog, but he doesn't mind Musk being there, who is also a big dog, which is a lot of people said would never happen like Trump has to be the apex predator.
LEVI: Yeah, I'm not sure ego works like that, exactly, like, we all have an ego. You need to have a healthy amount of it, but you want to try and wrestle the rest of that to the ground? And I think that, you know, listen the miracle and Butler this, this tilting your head just as much, and like, (inaudible) bullet, move, and then, the rest of history, literally, world history change in that moment, and how all that continue to culminate. And I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that Donald Trump, President Trump, was put in the situation that humbled him more than probably anything that's ever humbled -- that kind of a situation would only humble anybody.
And I think that, that has brought a lot more humanity to him, and I think that that's what led to this unity coalition with him and Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard, and Elon Musk, I mean, all of that, that's a dream team. So, why not go sit next to this person that clearly you've already entrusted with, literally getting into the dirt of our government in every way, shape and form, and go, shine the light, let the light be the disinfectant. And while we're at it, I'm going to insult you on how you're dressed.
GUTFELD: Yes.
LEVI: Why not? That's how I would do it.
GUTFELD: Amen. Kat, a lot of people aren't aware of this, but you DVR Hannity every night as a Sean superfan, and a self-proclaimed Hannity head, what did you think of the interview? Was that his best work?
TIMPF: OK, so, I actually don't want to make this come off as shade to Sean Hannity, because it's not, yes, he did a great job, but it's, I don't think that hard to make that look interesting, like, those two sitting next to each other, I would have handled it differently if they gave me the interview.
GUTFELD: Really?
TIMPF: I think I would have just, like, come in with some Google slides, and like, every one of the slides had just, like, some random (BEEP) on it, like a picture of something random, and I click it, I'd be like, go. And let them talk about it for like, and I'd set a timer for like, whatever, 10 minutes. And it'd be like a picture of something, and then like, and just watch them interact. Maybe bring on a plate of croissants, watch them eat the croissants, read their horoscopes to each other, because it is very interesting, this friendship. I want to see it play out a little more, just like the bro dynamic between them.
GUTFELD: Except for buddy cop movement.
TIMPF: Yes, exactly.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TIMPF: Yes, two lawn chairs at a pool to a camera, you're leaving one camera?
GUTFELD: No, that is true. That is true. Paul, what are your thoughts on this?
MAURO: You know, it's funny, every President has a Vice President, right? But this is the first time we've had a President with a side-kick.
GUTFELD: Yes.
MAURO: Right?
GUTFELD: It's so true.
MAURO: I mean, the other thing I'm a little afraid of, there's an old saying, right, first friends are first enemies, right? And, God help us if these two fall out. Oh, my God.
GUTFELD: I was thinking about that.
MAURO: What a galactic level dilemma that will be. But, you know, I think in a way, we actually don't appreciate Musk and his -- I mean, you know, you take it for granted, now we all got used to this. We got this kooky character. He's brilliant. He can do all these things. He's like a guy from your neighborhood that, like, you made fun of, and then, you find out, like, oh my God, he's running the world.
But, the thing is, is that, I mean, really, if you think about it, and I've said this before, the guy has a rocket ship and it works. And the people come back in one piece. You know it's like, Joe Biden couldn't get our people back from Afghanistan in one piece. This guy sends people up into the solar system. He brings them back. Thank God, he's on our side. So, you know what?
Give him a little bit play. He's awkward there, I went to the garden when he was there with Trump at the rally. I don't think anybody got more loved than he did. I think it's very Kenny of Trump to keep him around. He softens him. And like I said, he is a little bit the side-kick, but he's a side-kick with some real muscle.
GUTFELD: Yeah, it's true. Well done. All right. Trying to figure out which one's star ski. All right. Up next, Playboy's boosting sales by dropping dudes in whales.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: I'm trying to figure out which one is Starsky.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: All right, up next, "Playboy" is boosting sales by dropping dudes and whales.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A story in five words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Old "Playboy" is back, baby. Kat, you're going to love this. "Playboy" is returning to its original content after a failed woke rebrand, which included a transgender playmate, a centerfold from singer Lizzo, and no nudity. So they returned this money after a five-year hiatus, which is Greek for break, featuring a nude woman on the cover. Don't they deserve to die, because they gave into the mob and now they think we're going to take them back? Those filthy pervs.
TIMPF: Yes, I think that "Playboy" has bigger problems. I don't think it's just the woke that's why there's issues. I think it's also the Internet. You can see a lot of stuff on the Internet.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: Like, even if people in "Playboy" are hot, the Internet is not just you can see hot. You can see stuff on the Internet that makes you confused about your ability to decipher what is and is not hot for the rest of your life.
GUTFELD: Yes, that is true.
TIMPF: That's what you're up against? OK, magazine.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Paul, would say Hugh Hefner is rolling in his grave, but it's impossible with his erection.
(LAUGHTER)
MAURO: You've got to say, what really is happening here is Donald Trump has made porn great again.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
MAURO: That's really what it is. Now we don't have to play into any DEI centerfolds or anything like that. We can just do this. The other factor I think that's going on here is the unseen hand of Adam Smith. What is that hand doing relative to "Playboy." It's capitalism. It wasn't working. That is the free market. And as Kat says, there's too many alternatives. And so when they said, you know what, it's not working, we're not selling the magazines. We're not short of 14-year-old guys, right. They are still out there. The difference is they're on different websites and everywhere else. And deciding to go obese didn't work.
GUTFELD: Yes, they grew the models, but not the advertising.
Zach, "Playboy" could have stood up for free speech. This was a prime moment during the wokeism that "Playboy" could have actually stood up against it, but they didn't.
LEVI: Yes, man, I don't know. There's so many weird influences, and I think corporations, there's people in leadership positions that don't, and by the way, across industries and across corporations, a lot of people that don't really know how to lead that corporation. And they're just grasping at straws. And like, I don't know. What is everybody else doing. What do we have to do to make sure that nobody comes after us? Do we need to do this? We'll do that. Do we need to do that? We'll do that.
And I think people have been chasing their tail a lot in all of that, "Playboy" apparently being one of them, trying to appeal to masses that don't exist. So I don't know, I understand it's a joke, but I really hope Trump didn't make porn great again. To each their own, but I think we have a massive problem in this country and in this world. We do. It is destroying young men and young women's lives. And OnlyFans has become a subset of that that is literally making young girls just straight up prostitutes right out of the gate. It's not like, hey, I tried to get a corporate job. Things didn't work out, then I'm doing that. No, it's I'm start my whole life doing this.
And then these young guys working hard, making money, and just blowing it all. And I will say, not for nothing, guys, just wake up, because A.I. is about to take over all that stuff. And A.I., porn, and OnlyFans and all that stuff is going to be ubiquitous and it's going to be treacherous.
(LAUGHTER)
LEVI: That is really funny, too.
GUTFELD: Way to poke a hole in this light segment. But you are absolutely right. Jamie, has this made your life better knowing that "Playboy" is coming back? You're a lonely man who lives in a studio apartment.
LISSOW: I don't know, I can't explain it, but for some reason I feel really guilty right now.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: I don't know. No, I only watch pornography for the articles.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: Isn't it funny, though, they really did that? Like "Playboy" went, we're not going to have naked women. We were lying when we said we read it for the articles. They took it too seriously. They're like, oh, we'll just do this.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: And Kat made a great point I didn't even think about, because you have so much on your phone. And the other advantage is, if your mom finds your phone porn, she is not going to just throw it away. And Zach, I am just joking. I don't even watch. Even when I watch porn, I watch it for like two to three minutes.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: There you go.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Sports fans won't be moping because they are allowing doping.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five more words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Steroid Olympics has finally arrived. Paul, investors led by Donald Trump Jr. invested millions of dollars into the Enhanced Games, a sporting event later this year will allow participants to dope with legal performance enhancing drugs. This steroid Olympics will include events like track, swimming, and gymnastics. What say you? It could turn into the league of monsters?
MAURO: It really could. There's a term for the steroid Olympics. We call that, the Olympics. Who the hell believes these people are all clean. And you can hear the purists already saying that's not what the Greeks intended. They're all doing it. But my question is this. They call it the Enhanced Olympics? What are the future events going to look like? You can think about it. But if you're willing to do this, I say that we should be able to enhance performance in other areas, right? So if we give it Congress, you can take drugs. We're going to pump 20 ccs of something into Mitch McConnell's ass.
GUTFELD: He might be already having something, though, in his ass.
MAURO: Give it to Homan, all the CBP guys, keep them up for 20 hours a day.
In all seriousness, I don't think this is going to be all that different. And it seems like we're getting to a point where it's just going to all be robots.
MAURO: You know, Zach, we kind of do this at work with caffeine and half the office is on Adderall. We are already performance enhancing employees.
LEVI: Yes, I think that we are, unfortunately, we are way down the rabbit hole when it comes to lots of pharmaceuticals that have been introduced into this country and into our bodies for a really long time. And I think we need to take a really hard, long look at that. Thank you, Bobby Kennedy, for everything he's going to do in that regard. Yes.
(APPLAUSE)
LEVI: Bobby Kennedy. But listen, man, when it comes to this stuff, to your point, the Olympics have already been kind of the steroid Olympics, at least for some athletes, particularly from specific countries that have continually done that type of stuff. But it's been across the board.
The one thing I'm actually looking forward in all of this, though, is if we can actually just give some athletes, and there's obviously going to lots of safety testing and things. They're not going to just be letting people do crazy, crazy things, but to the extent that we are biohacking now, we're figuring out how to make our bodies healthier, stronger, faster, all that, and there's a lot of very weird gray areas for Olympic athletes that are doing basically nothing, but then they get hit with this. So loosen up on that, let these guys go crazy, and I think we're going to learn a lot about the human body and what does effectually make us healthier and stronger. And then people, it's almost like a testing ground for that kind of --
GUTFELD: Yes, it's like war. It's like in wars we're testing out drones and stuff, but now we're going to test out drugs and create mammoth monsters.
A lot of people don't know, Jamie, you are up biathlete. You cry and self- harm.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: Yes, that's right. Always self-harm first, that's the correct order.
Greg, if you had told me one of the president's sons is adding drugs to sports and showing it on television, I would not have guessed Donald Trump Jr.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
LISSOW: I'm kind of glad they're doing this. I've had a problem with some of this. And like Zach said, there's a lot of drugs that are completely legal that you can kicked out for doing the Olympics. Remember Shaun White, the snowboarder.
GUTFELD: Yes.
LISSOW: They stripped his metal away for taking marijuana. If that had been me and I found marijuana in his system, I would have been like, here's another gold medal.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: If you're taking a drug that makes it harder to do your event, I think that should be legal. This is a little bit off topic, but I also think in equestrian events, the horse should get the medal.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes, good idea.
LISSOW: I feel if the horse could talk after, he'd be like, yes, if I didn't have that guy on me I would have gone even faster.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Kat, you love the Olympics, don't you?
TIMPF: I love these Olympics. I think it's great. If you want to do steroids and run around, do you. But there's going to be free medical screening, or there's medical screening involved. I want to sign up Cheens to do it, my 14-and-a-half-year-old cat, yes, because he's already on steroids for his IBD, and it sounds like if he participates he gets a free echocardiogram. And those are expensive.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TIMPF: He also has cardiomyopathy.
GUTFELD: You can has his own cardiologist?
TIMPF: Of course he does. Do you think I'm an animal? Of course. And a gastroenterologist.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That's amazing.
All right, enough of your problems. A trigger warning ban on Peter Pan.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Will wokesters be mourning their beloved trigger warning? Disney is reportedly rolling back the trigger warnings that run before some of their classic titles on its streaming services. Things like "Dumbo" and "Peter Pan" previously alerted viewers about, quote, "negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures." But now the warnings have been reduced to a simplified message in the title's details section. That's good news.
But there is still no warning on "Snow White." Imagine me as a child stumbling on a movie that dresses up little people and calls them dwarves.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Now I can't even visit my cottage in the forest without breaking down in tears. And I had to quit my job at the mine.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: So -- I'll let you think about that for a while. Zach, so they are rolling back all these DEI programs, and woke entertainment seems to be failing. You've got a new movie coming out called "The Unbreakable Boy." Does it need any trigger warnings?
LEVI: No. No, it needs no trigger warnings. It's is a beautiful film. It's a true story about a real family navigating, navigating family, navigating marriage, navigating having children, the oldest of which, their oldest son Austin who was born with brittle bones disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, and autism. And I think at this point autism touches all of our lives in way, shape, or form. This true story is true and it's a really authentic and beautiful take on that subject matter, one I've never seen before. It's infused with a faith infused. It's representative of people going on a real journey through darkness and finding the redemption on the other side. My character, the father character, he struggles with alcoholism. He really has to go hell and back and recognize that he's got a beautiful life in front of him. And his son with autism really helps show him that. So it's a beautiful story, and one I hope everyone goes and sees it sometime.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: So no car chases?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: No guy tied to a chair?
LEVI: No, let me finish, let me finish. There's car chases, and how many guys do we have tied to chairs? So many.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Paul, didn't "Fantasia" disturb you as a child? It disturbed me, gave me nausea.
MAURO: What is that?
GUTFELD: "Fantasia."
TIMPF: It's basically like a really long screen saver.
(LAUGHTER)
MAURO: I missed that particular one. You know, you've got to say, my question is this. How on earth did "Dumbo" need a trigger warning? It's about an elephant that flies. Who are you worried -- this is where I'm supposed to make the Behar joke, I guess, right?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That's my turf.
MAURO: I watched the show. I know what is expected of me. But sincerely, how is it that Disney --
GUTFELD: There are many children with big ears.
MAURO: Apparently. As a kid, "Fantasia" I never caught up with. But it was the most anodyne, even as a kid, you found it kind of boring, right? Because it was so vanilla. Like you were saying, nobody got shot. You were waiting for somebody to come in the window with a machine gun. And it doesn't happen because it's all nicey-nice. So where are the trigger warnings? All I say is this. We really dodged a bullet because, again, a year ago, the trigger warnings were in place.
GUTFELD: Yes. What do you say, Jamie? You've got some kids still?
LISSOW: I do, we don't really watch much Disney. But I just want to take a minute and say Zach's movie looks so good, man. And I watched the trailer. I actually haven't cried that much during a video since I watched my wedding video back.
(LAUGHTER)
LISSOW: If Disney has a trigger warning, I think it should say, caution, your kids are going to want to spend $30,000 at Disney this year if you watch this movie.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Kat, last word to you.
TIMPF: At what age can you not just watch "Dateline" around the baby?
GUTFELD: That's a good question.
TIMPF: I really want to know. At what age do I have to start watching this crap?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I've been thinking about that, because I still watch a lot of "Dateline", and there is a lot of grizzly stuff going on.
TIMPF: Everything I watch, people are getting murdered. I don't want to have that in the house, meaning a murderer baby.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Murderer baby, tonight on "Dateline." Kat Timpf thought she had a normal child.
TIMPF: I hope Keith Morrison narrates if it does happen.
GUTFELD: All right, don't go away. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Zach Levi, go see his movie, Jamie Lissow, Paul Mauro, Kat Timpf, our studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
