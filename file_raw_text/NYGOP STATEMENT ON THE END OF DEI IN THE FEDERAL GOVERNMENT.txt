The following information was released by the New York Republican Party:
The New York Republican State Committee released the following statement in recognition of the end of DEI in the federal government:
All Americans should celebrate the end of divisive and ineffective DEI policies that prioritize identity politics over merit, fostering division and diminishing the excellence and accountability that should define public service. United behind President Trump, Republicans are restoring common sense to federal governance and reaffirming that the American Dream is for everyone willing to work for it.
New York State should immediately follow suit, eliminating DEI programs across government, including SUNY and CUNY.
For every American who suffered at the hands of the Orwellian DEI regime in the public or private sector over the last several years this moment is for you.
NYGOP Spokesman David Laska
President Trump's executive order closes every DEI office in the federal government at 5:00 PM ET today and places DEI officers on paid leave ahead of their eventual termination.
