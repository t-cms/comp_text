ICYMI | Secretary Scott Turner on Fox & Friends - "DEI is dead at HUD."
WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner joined Fox & Friends to discuss ending diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), $1.9 billion in misplaced funds found by HUD, and President Trump's action to ensure American taxpayer dollars are used for the benefit of American citizens.
Ending DEI:
"...We cut $4 million dollars in DEI contracts here at HUD, which were supposed to be for culture transformation and outward mindset training thinking and subscription services...This is money that should go to serve the American people and also time well spent to go to serve the people we're called to serve."
$1.9 Billion Misplaced by Biden Administration Recovered by HUD:
"...We also found $1.9 billion dollars in misplaced funds, which were supposed to be used for administrative services here at HUD...It was great mismanagement and negligence over the past few years from the Biden Administration. Now that we've found these funds, we can notify and de-obligate so that the Treasury Department can use those funds for other federal expenditures for the American people."
President Trump's Executive Order to End Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders:
"It's common sense. Under President Trump's leadership, the hard-earned money of American taxpayers should go to serve the American people. That's what we're doing here at HUD to ensure we are deliberate and detailed about the expenditures that we have to serve the American people."
