50501 protest comes to Harrisburg

Ell Adams Protesters fill the streets of Harrisburg for the 50501 Movement protest on February 17, 2025
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Harrisburg for the political activist group 50501 on February 17, seeking the inclusivity of all peoples and challenging President Donald Trump's recent executive orders.  
 
50 protests, in 50 states, all in one day - that is the meaning of the 50501 movement. The organized protest initially began on Reddit and quickly gained traction on other social media platforms from thousands of users upset at the latest laws from the White House. Protesters in multiple cities across the United States aim to unite citizens to take a stand against the second Trump administration's "anti-democratic" policies.

As many as 500 people protested in Harrisburg, marching from City Island to the State Capitol carrying picket signs conveying their beliefs. There were several speakers at the protest, including Dauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas. Ell Adams, a junior Interpersonal Communication major at Commonwealth University - Bloomsburg, was among the crowd. 
 
"Being at the protest gave me a sense of ownership and control over what's happening," Adams stated. "It makes you feel hopeful about the situation."  
 
Since entering office for a second term, President Trump has ordered federal agencies to dispose of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs and practices in government-funded companies and education facilities. Trump deems DEI as radical, wasteful and discriminatory under Executive Order 14151, and has given America's schools and universities 2 weeks to end their programs. 
 
DEI allows for more accessibility in workplaces to minority groups such as people of color, disabled Americans, and all women regardless of race. Former President Barack Obama first promoted DEI with Executive Order 13583, signed in 2011 and titled "Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce." President Trump, however, promotes that his anti-DEI order provides better safety for women.  
 
According to Adams, the government is essentially gutting the Department of Education. "It's an era of less information," they stated. The loss of DEI programs will impact how current and incoming students are supported and taught. 
 
President Trump's recent executive orders have also impacted immigrants. February 20, 2025, brought a new law that bans illegal immigrants from receiving taxpayer financial support, targeting sanctuary cities across the U.S. 
 
Another demand from the President: The government, its related agencies, and federal employees must recognize biological males as male and biological females as female; use the term "sex" rather than "gender;" and terminate gender-affirming healthcare for patients under 19 years old. This order alienates transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals from workplaces, schools and public areas where they have previously been welcomed.
