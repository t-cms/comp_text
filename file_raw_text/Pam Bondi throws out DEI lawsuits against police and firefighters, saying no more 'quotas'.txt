Attorney General Pam Bondi announced she was throwing out DEI lawsuits against police officers and firefighters, which will dismiss several lawsuits begun in the Biden administration.
The move is part of the Donald Trump administration's plan to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.
'American communities deserve firefighters and police officers to be chosen for their skill and dedication to public safety - not to meet DEI quotas,' Bondi said in a statement.
She said she will end racial discrimination in the name of DEI and restoring merit-based opportunities nationwide. 
Biden signed several police reforms into law after the murder of George Floyd, a Minnesota man killed by a white police officer during an arrest.
The former president created a national registry of officers fired for misconduct, which Bondi disbanded.
Police reform has been a key issue with the Democratic Party's progressive base, particularly among black voters. 
Trump and Republicans accused Biden and Democrats of wanting to defund the police. 
Bondi also has been on a mission to clamp down on companies' diversity, equity and inclusion policies, on instructions from Trump.
Earlier this month she sent a memo ordering the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division to launch a new mission to 'investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities' in the private sector and at educational institutions that receive federal funds. 
Some companies are rolling back their DEI policies or renaming such efforts 'talent acquisition.' Those companies include: Pepsi, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Disney.
Trump has called out some companies by name - such as Apple - asking them to comply with his wishes on the matter. 
The administration argues DEI policies and programs are themselves discriminatory, saying some of these policies put white, straight men at a disadvantage.
It's all part of President Trump's mission to remake the federal government.
He ordered federal employees to remove their pronouns from their email signatures. 
And he required all federal agencies to 'recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.'
