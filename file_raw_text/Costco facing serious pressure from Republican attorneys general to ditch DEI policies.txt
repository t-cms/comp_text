Several Republican state attorneys general have written to  signaling they  amid President 's .
Nineteen Republican attorneys general -  and Iowa's Brenna Bird - have signed a letter demanding Costco either tell states it will repeal its own DEI policies or explain why they will be maintained. 
"We...urge Costco to end all unlawful discrimination imposed by the company through diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI") policies," the  reads. "Although Costco's motto is 'do the right thing,' it appears that the company is doing the wrong thing-clinging to DEI policies that courts and businesses have rejected as illegal."
The Independent has contacted Costco for comment.
Ninety-eight percent of U.S. Costco shareholders voted against a proposal requesting the company evaluate and report on the risks associated with their DEI efforts last week.
"Our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics," Costco's Board of Directors said in a statement regarding the proposal, per .

"Our efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all," the statement continued. "We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed."
The letter to Costco comes after Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his presidency directing agency leaders . This order also means all federal DEI workers have been put on leave.

We will continue to monitor and adjust as needed," the company said in a . "Current actions include...concluding our Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) initiatives in 2025 as planned."
The company will also no longer have a presence at the Twin Cities Pride celebration this year,  reports.
Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, also announced its plan to repeal DEI programs - which came before Trump took office. Instead, the company will "focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background," a spokesperson told the  on January 10.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended Trump's inauguration soon after the announcement.
However, other companies are standing their ground and maintaining their DEI policies. These companies include Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.
"We strongly believe that organizations benefit from diverse perspectives, and Goldman Sachs is committed to operating our programs and policies in compliance with the law," a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs told .
