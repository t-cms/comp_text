St. Joseph, MO (February 9th, 2025) - President Donald Trump issued an executive order on January 20, 2025, canceling all federal funding to advance or sustain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at institutions receiving federal aid. This executive order has triggered a wave of responses from universities across the nation, which are now terminating their diversity initiatives in light of the policy change.
Missouri Western's, Kent Heir, a university spokesman made this statement via email to address the impact of this new federal policy.
"Our goal is to provide a supportive environment where all students can thrive and succeed, and that will never change. With the ongoing national conversation about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and with the departure of some staff members in Student Affairs, we are evaluating many of our student support and programming services. Our objective remains to help students adjust, flourish, and excel at student life."
This sentiment was echoed by several other universities across the country, including Missouri Western's Maryville neighbor, Northwest Missouri State University. According to the Northwest Missourian, Northwest President Dr. Lance Tatum, announced that the university would terminate diversity programs in response to the federal directive. 
"Northwest is transitioning to a model that broadens our holistic approach to student achievement. Our focus at Northwest is now and will always be on student success, but as higher education evolves, we must also evolve so our students have every opportunity to realize their dreams. 
Northwest's decision reflects a broader trend seen at many universities across the country, as the cancellation of federal funding for DEI programs has forced administrators to reconsider the future of these initiatives. Universities will reduce the scope of their diversity-focused programs. However, institutions like Northwest and Missouri Western have made it clear that they will still strive to maintain an inclusive campus environment, even without the financial resources they once had.

The executive order has ignited a national debate on diversity in higher education. Advocates of the policy argue that universities should prioritize academic merit over social policies and avoid promoting specific political ideologies through federally funded programs. They believe that such programs have sometimes gone too far in fostering division rather than unity.
On the other hand, critics of the order warn that dismantling DEI programs could undo years of progress in addressing systemic inequality in higher education. They argue that diversity initiatives are vital for creating inclusive environments where all students, regardless of background, can succeed and feel supported.
Missouri Western, for its part, remains focused on its core mission of student success, regardless of changes in federal funding. The university has emphasized that its commitment to providing resources for student achievement will continue, even as it evaluates the ways it provides support and services to its diverse student body.
As the conversation around diversity, equity, and inclusion continues to evolve, universities will need to adapt their strategies in response to the new financial realities brought about by the executive order. While the loss of federal funding poses a challenge, universities have expressed their unwavering dedication to ensuring that all students can thrive and excel in their academic journeys.
