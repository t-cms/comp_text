On Jan. 20, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order titled "Ending Radical and Wasteful Government Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Programs and Preferencing." This order mandates the cancellation of "discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities in the federal government," according to CBS News.
As a result, the U.S. government will no longer support "special observances," effectively pausing all federal recognitions, such as this month's recognition of Black History Month as well as Juneteenth, Pride Month, Holocaust Remembrance Day and others.
Ignoring these observances is not just an oversight - it is part of a broader pattern of whitewashing history and silencing marginalized communities.
Trump claims that DEI initiatives create an unfair disadvantage for other Americans. In reality, DEI exists to support those who have historically been excluded - primarily people who are not white or male.
Cutting funding for special observances was framed as a cost-saving measure, but in practice, it erases representation and weakens national acknowledgment of diverse histories. These observances once symbolized appreciation and recognition. Their removal sends a different message: The colored history of America and their contributions don't matter.
This rollback isn't just happening at the federal level. Many corporations are now retreating from their DEI commitments as well. There is no legitimate reason for major companies to pull back on these policies - many are simply attempting to satisfy Trump. This retreat not only undermines workplace diversity but also discourages people of color or with disabilities from applying to jobs or programs due to fear of rejection. Just as the government is attempting to erase representation, corporations following suit only deepen the impact. Who's to say that colleges and other educational institutions are not next in rolling back their diversity celebrations?
But the absence of government and corporate recognition does not mean these observances lose their value. A date is just a designated time to highlight something important - but in truth, these histories and contributions deserve to be honored every day.
Take this month, for example. Black history is American history. Without Black Americans, the country we know today would cease to exist - they are one of its foundational pillars. Recognizing their achievements is not just about appreciation; it is about resisting efforts to erase their contributions. The same applies to Pride Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Hispanic Heritage Month and so many more. We should continue to celebrate these historic observances to ensure that the history of diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility is never forgotten.
Berry College itself provides a strong example of why these observances matter. The school desegregated in 1964 - 61 years ago - marking a significant step toward inclusion. Today, that history is honored through initiatives like Be Love Week, a celebration of service and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy. This year's event featured Ruby Bridges, a powerful reminder of the struggle for integration. Even as the federal government turns its back on these observances, institutions like Berry show that communities can still take action to honor and preserve these legacies.
What Trump is attempting to do is make it harder for marginalized communities to be represented and understood. There is no doubt that his actions benefit wealthy white Americans and those who seek to uphold systemic inequality.
To fight back against the cancellation of "special observances," everyone should continue to celebrate what makes America truly diverse and rich in culture. Attend community events such as parades or protests, many of these will continue despite the lack of government recognition. Showing up to protests as an ally demonstrates support for inclusion. Support minority-owned businesses, when possible, whether through shopping or dining. Engaging with and uplifting these businesses directly strengthens communities that have historically faced economic barriers. On social media, share stories and facts that educate others and keep awareness alive.
Here at Berry, there are many opportunities to recognize diversity and inclusion, such as the Feb. 20 Cultural Event on "Conversations about Disability: The Peanut Butter Falcon." Additionally, continue to serve your community. Berry often partners with minority communities through service initiatives, reinforcing the idea that recognition goes beyond a date on the calendar, it is about active participation and meaningful engagement year-round.
Diversity matters. Representation matters. And no government decision can erase the importance of these communities or the need to celebrate them.
