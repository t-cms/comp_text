U.S. government websites remained online and accessible on Friday, with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) clarifying that media reports suggesting the sites would be taken offline were based on a misinterpretation of a memo.
The memo, issued on Wednesday, instructed federal agencies to remove references to 'gender ideology' from contracts, job descriptions, and social media accounts.
The message - issued in accordance with President Donald Trump's executive order mandating the government to recognize only two sexes - also outlined the steps for implementing the executive order.
Initially, a source had indicated that most government websites would go offline after 5 pm ET on Friday, later clarifying that the time was actually a deadline for removing diversity-related content.
An OPM spokesperson added, 'The memo may have been misinterpreted to mean we would shut down government websites that couldn't comply, but that is not the plan for continuing to implement this important effort.'
When asked earlier about the potential shutdown of government websites during the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) content, Trump told reporters, 'I don't know. It doesn't sound like a bad idea to me.'
He continued, 'I think DEI is dead, so [if] they want to scrub the websites, that's OK with me.'
Since taking office on January 20, Trump has swiftly moved to dismantle federal diversity initiatives. 
Titled 'Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing and Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions', Trump's order reverse Biden's DEI executive order he enacted on his first day in office in January 2021.
Trump's order claimed federally mandated DEI initiatives 'not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity.' 
'These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination,' the order concluded.
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officials scrambled Friday to meet the 5 p.m. deadline to implement Trump's order that the federal government now only recognizes 'two sexes, male and female.''
The CDC removed much of its adult immunization guidance, which had included references to transgender and nonbinary people, as part of carefully considered vaccine recommendations approved by an advisory panel.
Pages that could not be immediately revised to remove gender references, such as those for transgender individuals, were taken down for reworking.
Hospitals, nonprofits and health departments were also affected. 
Letters obtained by CBS News, sent to organizations receiving federal health funding, left some grant recipients confused. 
One letter indicated that staff and communications would have to comply with the new rules, including removing pronouns from email signatures and eliminating gender references from websites, or risk losing federal funds.
Another letter targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, instructed recipients to 'immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting' those ideas 'at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contracts' supported by the funds.
This follows Trump's recent claim that diversity and inclusion policies contributed to one of the deadliest plane crashes in U.S. history.
On Wednesday night, American Eagle flight 5342 collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on a training flight as it approached the runway at Ronald Reagan National Airport.
There were 60 passengers and four crew aboard the PSA flight out of Wichita, and three members of the military aboard the Black Hawk.
All are believe to have perished after the search and rescue transitioned to a recovery phase.
Speaking at the White House, Trump addressed the collision between a passenger plane and a military helicopter in Washington, D.C., which claimed 67 lives, calling it a 'tragedy of terrible proportions.' He criticized the Black Hawk helicopter pilots, suggesting they should have been able to 'see where they were going.'
Trump asserted that the disaster was entirely preventable and blamed DEI hiring practices in federal agencies. He insisted he had 'pretty good ideas' about how the crash happened and vowed to prevent similar incidents in the future.
He went on to claim that, unlike Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, he prioritizes safety over politics. In a sharp critique of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Trump called him a 'disaster,' both as a mayor and in his cabinet role.
'He ran his city into the ground, and he's a disaster now. He's just got a good line of bulls***,' Trump said.
Trump linked the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring plan to the incident, arguing that federal agencies should prioritize intelligence over diversity. 
He emphasized that air traffic controllers should be 'geniuses' and referenced an internal FAA report that described the workforce as 'too white.'
But the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended Donald Trump 's criticism of DEI hiring practices in government and revealed new details about the investigation surrounding the fatal plane crash in D.C.
The defense secretary appeared on Fox News to discuss the tragedy on Friday, revealing that the investigation was focusing primarily on the altitude of the plane and the Black Hawk.
'We are looking at altitude, and the president was clear about that, someone was at the wrong altitude,' Hegseth said. 'Was the Black Hawk too high? Was it on course? Right now we don't quite know.'
