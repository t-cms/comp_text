Undergrads worry DEI rollbacks will impede job search

Some minority PNW students are concerned that moves to eliminate DEI policies will harm their job prospects.
"I think the elimination of inclusion programs could hurt my chances of landing a job," said Cherrelle Newsom, a senior Exercise Science major. "Inclusion is what brings our country closer as people and if it is eliminated that is what tears us apart."
DEI stands for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and seeks to promote the fair treatment and participation of all people, particularly those who have historically been underrepresented. There has been a growing movement to eliminate DEI policies in businesses and government, on the grounds they discriminate against white people.  
President Donald Trump recently signed executive orders eliminating federal DEI policies, suspending federal employees responsible for managing the government's DEI programs and laying out a timetable to dismiss them. Meanwhile, several corporations, including Walmart and McDonald's, have rolled back in their DEI policies and other companies are considering similar actions.
"I find it very concerning not only for myself, but for others who are looking for employment in today's world," said David Perez, sophomore Mathematics major. "DEI gave people an equal opportunity and allowed our voices to be heard, and now that that's gone it's honestly scary to think what the future may hold."
Jules Bikoy, a senior Liberal Arts major, is also worried about the impact of eliminating DEI policies.
"I feel as a minority you are born at a disadvantage so there are some things that are put in place to garner opportunities for people that have the same black skin as you and I or even other races that are also going through similar struggles," he said. "I feel that this will just lead to fewer people who were already born at a disadvantage [having] the ability to prosper." 
Mia Haro, a junior Chemistry major, is worried about the impact of part-time student jobs.
"It's a lose-lose situation ... with basic retail jobs, like Target and Walmart ... that are also pulling out of it," she said. "So ... not only can I not get ... a professional grade job, but also retail and stuff like ... are pulling out from all the DEI regulated hiring programs."
Jacqueline Garcia, a junior Education major, said the rollback ignore the fact that minorities begin job searches at a disadvantage.
"This puts me in a bit of a tight situation," she said. "I didn't grow up in neighborhoods or schools with the resources that my peers had growing up. This automatically puts me at a disadvantage and will affect my chances of getting a job as a teacher. 
"If this country is planning on being merit-based, then it should focus on making sure that everyone especially children all start at the same starting line," said Garcia. "I think that diversity is something needed everywhere especially in schools. Giving children role models to look up to and that look like them can give them confidence and motivation to pursue their dreams."
But some students remained optimistic about their futures.
"I do not think that the elimination of the DEI program will hurt my chances of landing a job because the construction industry is already diverse," said Andrew Stephen, a junior Construction Engineering and Management Technology major, "Since I am going into a Project Engineer role, I don't think DEI will be such a factor."
Devin Gibson, a senior Computer Graphic Technology, agrees about his chances of landing a job.
"I'm not too concerned about it," he said. "If you are qualified, you still have a good chance of getting the job. I don't think it was necessary to remove the DEI programs, but I do understand the opposing argument. I would say that hiring underqualified people was never a problem though. DEI programs were just supposed to give everyone an equal opportunity."
Jada Wallace, a freshman Nursing major, has mixed opinions about efforts to eliminate inclusion programs.
"I think that it limits the amount of opportunities that I will gain," she said. "But I also think it's not as bad as people think because it lets you know people's true intentions and I wouldn't want to be somewhere I'm not welcomed."
