Trump gave schools 2 weeks to ban DEI. Lawyers say it's not that simple.
President Donald Trump’s Education Department has a simple message to schools: ban all diversity, equity and inclusion at school or else. Last week, Craig Trainor, the Education Department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, wrote in a letter that the law now prohibits schools reliant on federal money from “using race in decisions” like admissions, financial aid and scholarships. The guidance has caused confusion on whether colleges would have to cancel special graduation ceremonies for marginalized groups or close resource centers and clubs for LGBTQ+, Black or Asian American students.

One individual who was laid off, Ron Gregory, was going to be part of a team to go to Iowa and Ohio to help with bird flu efforts.
