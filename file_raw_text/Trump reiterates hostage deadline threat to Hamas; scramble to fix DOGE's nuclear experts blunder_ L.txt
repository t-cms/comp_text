President Donald Trump on Friday kept alive his drumbeat of tariff threats, saying levies on automobiles would be coming as soon as April 2, the day after members of his cabinet are due to deliver reports to him outlining options for a range of import duties as he seeks to reshape global trade.
"Maybe around April 2," Trump said in response to a question about when auto tariffs might be coming during an executive order signing session in the Oval Office. "I would have done them on April 1 ... But we're going to do it on April 2."
It was the latest in a litany of trade actions Trump has unveiled after taking office for the second time on January 20.
Since his inauguration, he has imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China, on top of existing levies; announced and then delayed for a month 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and nonenergy imports from Canada; set a March 12 start date for 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum; and on Thursday directed his economics team to devise plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports.

Since Trump fired the board of directors and was elected board chair of the center, numerous officials and performers have quit or canceled appearances, including the actor Issa Rae.

"After learning about the changes in leadership at the Kennedy Center, including Trump becoming self-appointed Chairman, I was debating whether or not to perform," she said.
"I am a proud queer, Latina, disabled woman and ally to the unprotected and vulnerable trans community in the United States," she added. "I figured if the new guys want to eliminate DEI, I'll let them decide to cancel the show if they want to - otherwise, see you February 15th."

A second federal judge on Friday paused Trump's executive order halting federal support for gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19.
U.S. District Court Judge Lauren King granted a temporary restraining order after the Democratic attorneys general of Washington state, Oregon and Minnesota sued the Trump administration last week. Three doctors joined as plaintiffs in the suit, which was filed in the Western District of Washington.
The decision came one day after a federal judge in Baltimore temporarily blocked the executive order in response to a separate lawsuit filed on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children.
Judge Brendan Hurson's temporary restraining order will last 14 days but could be extended, and essentially puts Trump's directive on hold while the case proceeds. Hurston and King were both appointed by former President Joe Biden.

Trump's mass layoffs of federal workers and spending freezes could come back to bite him in the economic data.
The monthly jobs reports could start to show a slowdown in hiring, if not go negative at some point after the February numbers are released. The last time the economy lost jobs during a month was in December 2020, when the United States was still muscling its way out of the coronavirus pandemic.
"Overall, it doesn't seem that DOGE has managed to actually cut spending substantively yet - instead they've just created chaos," said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University. She noted that employers that rely on government grants and contracts would also show declines in hiring, if not worse.
"Given everything that is happening in the federal government, it is very plausible that job growth could turn negative at some point," Gimbel said. "But it may take a few more reports for the impact to show up."
