Congressman Hank Johnson's Statement Following President Trump's Executive Order Targeting DEI
Congressman Hank Johnson released the following statement:
"With the issuance of an Executive Order, Donald Trump has declared war on equal employment and contracting opportunities in the federal government for Black and Brown people, and for women. He seeks to Make America Great Again by turning back the clock and dismantling decades of progress made by Black people in America since enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It wont work.
"Make no mistake, this Executive Order does not protect civil rights. To the contrary, it gives federal government officials and complicit federal contractors a green light to engage in discriminatory practices that exclude minorities and women from employment and contracting opportunities. This Order is a blatant step backwards--a reversal of 60 years of progress. It not only seeks to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in government--it represent a refusal to enforce the civil rights laws that protect minorities and women from systemic racism and its persistent effects that remain as barriers to equal opportunity.
"I am committed to ensuring that our country does not go backwards. We must move forward. Every American deserves protection from discrimination and an equal opportunity to have a seat at the table. I will continue the fight for justice, fairness, and opportunity for all."
