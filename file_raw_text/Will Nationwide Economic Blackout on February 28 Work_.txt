Highlight: An organization is calling for a nationwide economic blackout on major U.S. retailers to send a message about DEI.
Body


A nationwide economic blackout scheduled for February 28 has gained momentum as consumers prepare to halt spending for a day in protest.
Led by The People's Union, organizers aim to highlight consumer power and push back against corporate decisions, particularly regarding diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) rollbacks.
"The goal of the  is simple, to show that we the people, are the backbone of this economy," John Schwarz, founder of The People's Union, told Newsweek.
While similar boycotts have occurred in the past, experts remain divided on whether a one-day spending freeze will have a significant financial impact.
Why It Matters
The economic blackout is being promoted as a means for consumers to demonstrate their influence on the financial system. The initiative follows widespread backlash against major retailers and corporations accused of retreating from DEI commitments after the Trump administration took steps to dismantle federal DEI programs.
Historically, economic  have been used as tools for social change. However, analysts argue that modern-day consumer behavior may limit the immediate impact of a one-day blackout.
What To Know
On February 28, participants are encouraged to avoid spending money at major retailers, fast food chains and gas stations. The goal is to withhold consumer dollars from large corporations to send a message about financial power and influence.
The People's Union, a grassroots organization leading the blackout, has emphasized the symbolic power of collective action.
"Corporations and politicians have built a system designed to keep us struggling while they profit off our labor and spending. This blackout is a wake up call, a first step in proving that we have the power to disrupt their system when we stand together," Schwarz told Newsweek.
According to Schwarz, the success of the blackout will be determined by the level of participation, which he plans to monitor through website registrations, interactions on social media and the overall visibility of the campaign.
 campaigns have played a significant role in spreading awareness, with supporters calling on others to take part and demonstrate economic solidarity. Some activists believe the blackout could be a starting point for more sustained consumer activism.
Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minneapolis-based civil rights lawyer and founder of the Racial Justice Network, told Newsweek the spending freeze will work if enough individuals join in and speak up.
"In light of the onslaught of recent executive orders and nonsensical attacks on DEI coming from the Trump administration, this spending freeze is an opportunity to use the power of the purse to push back on harmful ideas and enforcement actions that should not be tolerated," Levy Armstrong said.
Analysts suggest that while a brief pause in consumer spending may not significantly affect corporate revenue, it could generate discussion and increase awareness of economic activism. However, if the boycott gains traction and turns into a longer economic freeze on spending, companies could start to take notice.
"This protest's real power lies in its potential for escalation. If the People's Union follows through with planned longer-term boycotts, we could see significant shifts in how corporations balance profit margins against social responsibility. Smart investors are already watching this movement closely," Michael Ryan, founder and CEO of MichaelRyanMoney.com, previously told Newsweek.
Beyond the February 28 event, Schwarz noted future actions, including "targeted boycotts, economic resistance, and legislative demands" to sustain engagement.
What People Are Saying
John Schwarz, founder of The People's Union, told Newsweek: "The People's Union USA is not just about one day, it's about creating a long term strategic action. February 28th is the start, but we are building a sustained movement that continues to grow with each video posted."
"This isn't a one time protest, it really is the beginning of a shift in how the people can demonstrate their power intelligently to the corporations and government."
Nekima Levy Armstrong, Minneapolis-based civil rights lawyer and founder of the Racial Justice Network, told Newsweek: "I support the idea of a one-day spending freeze to send a message to corporations and the Trump administration that in spite of who thinks they are in control, we the people are actually the ones who hold the power in this democracy.
Taking this uniform approach to collectively wield our economic power reminds us that we are not helpless and hopeless, but that we have the power to effect change on a broader scale. The one-day spending freeze is a complementary effort to our nationwide boycott of  stores in response to their decision to rollback DEI investments, policies, and initiatives."
Kevin Thompson, finance expert and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek: "A lot of people dismiss the idea, arguing that a one-day spending freeze won't move the needle for major corporations or the broader financial system. And I agree—it'll likely have a minimal direct impact. But what many overlook is the power of the idea. The playbook for this already exists—Montgomery, 1955, the Bus Boycott. If this gains traction, it could turn into something much bigger, especially if people extend it beyond just one day."
Alex Beene, financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: "If you're looking to make an impact, I think targeting specific entities and products isn't always the best way to go. The better decision is to make cuts to your budget where you can and donate to causes you support. Change costs money, whether it's through a non-profit, a social campaign or a political run for office. Using your financial resources to assist in those is a more sound long-term play than carefully watching the exact retailer you use to buy groceries or medicine from each week."
What Happens Next
The effectiveness of the economic blackout will be evaluated after February 28, with potential follow-up actions that include an extended boycott targeting  from March 7 to March 14.
Analysts suggest that while the immediate financial impact may be limited, the movement's long-term success will depend on sustained consumer participation and corporate responses to public pressure.
