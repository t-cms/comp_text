BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: -- East, 03:00 p.m. on the West Coast. You can follow me on Instagram and X, @bretbaier. Put a lot of stuff about the Super Bowl and that interview on there ahead of Saturday and Sunday. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this Special Report. Fair, balanced, and still unafraid. The Ingraham Angle is now.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle. Thank you, as always, for joining us tonight. Our control, alt, delete moment. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Trump is resetting the federal government.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Woke is Gonzo. Over the past two weeks, our strength has been restored, our spirit has been revived, and a new national momentum has been sweeping across our land. The Golden Age of America has officially begun. Our economy is roaring back to life. Optimism is soaring. Hope is returning, and we have brought back the words common sense to our government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: He and his cabinet are moving so rapidly on so many levels that Democrats are feverishly trying to keep up. And when they're not filing lawsuits, we'll get to that in a moment in liberal jurisdictions, they're scrambling to get their messaging in order.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. GREG CASAR (D-TX): This is a national emergency. In the aftermath of the election, many Democrats needed time to soul search, to grieve, to think, but that time has ended, and that time ended when Elon Musk took control of our country's financial nuclear codes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Do they actually pay people to write those lines, the nuclear financial codes. Is he kidding me? Now for liberals, a $36 trillion debt is not a national emergency, but the DOGE crews identifying spending scams, that is a national emergency. Oh, OK. Only now, though, are Americans beginning to really understand how deep the corruption runs in Washington, and courtesy of DOGE and its allies on the Hill, we're seeing what is tantamount to an ongoing brazen theft from the U.S. taxpayers. No wonder the co-conspirators are all in a froth.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): What we are seeing unfold is an unlawful power grab by a, unelected and unaccountable billionaire puppet master.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at what Musk is announcing every single day that he is doing. Elon Musk, take your hands off the people's money.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Take your hands off the people's money. That's funny. Well, the people elected Donald Trump to clean up this mess, and that's exactly what he's doing. In response, Democrats only have hyperbole, and of course, their fall back lies.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't want (ph) elected Elon Musk to have access to their personal data. There's nothing about co-President Musk that is about saving the American people money.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Of course, that's false. He is saving us money, and he is not combing through IRS files, accessing people's personal data. That's what Democrats do, like during the Obama administration, when they nosed into conservatives files over at the IRS. The Democrats big pile (ph) phase Elon Musk you think, it doesn't look like it, because he knows that the numbers don't lie. A comprehensive audit of federal spending, we've needed it forever, and it shows that billions upon billions of dollars are being blown on moronic projects supported by globalists, and of course, the hard Left.
Money flows to their ideological bed fellows for things such as 361,000 to queer trans pan-sexual non-binary and two spirit people on how to farm. 1.5 million to advance DEI in Serbian businesses, oh, goodie. 2 million for sex changes and LGBT activism and Guatemala. 2.5 million for EVs for Vietnam, and 3 million on girl-centered climate action.
And what if you are feeling kind of stressed out, and you're an employee over at USAID. Well, for the modest price tag of 31.5 million, they hired a consultant to assist you with counseling, organizational resilience, wellness and work life. Is work life balance now abbreviated to just work life, I guess so.
And well, OK, this is all obscene. We know it. It's still a drop in the bucket compared to what we already knew had happened in fiscal year 2023 when Biden and company blew through 236 billion with a B in improper payments within 71 federal programs, 71. And by the way, it was even worse in 2022. 247 billion in improper payments. Now try to wrap your head around this. Since fiscal year 2003, again this spans Republican and Democrat administrations, cumulative federal improper payment estimates total about $2.7 trillion. Now this means people who got the money and grant recipients didn't qualify for the money that they still received and that the payments were sent, in some cases, totally in error. So 2.7 trillion over about 20 years, cannot make that up.
But as infuriating as it is that we're funding all of the nonsense and wasting trillions of dollars, it's far more disturbing that you and I are actually subsidizing woke propaganda that's packaged as news. 3.2 million for the BBC media action group. They got 8 percent of their entire income from the American taxpayers. And of course, we know they all despise Trump.
But wait a second, Trump is attacking journalism. That's what the Left is saying here. Expect sob stories to start pouring in. But are Democrats really going to defend our funding $268 million worth of grants to news outlets across the globe. I mean, in a mystery novel that all would end up being some type of CIA front group, because it sure sounds like it. Taxpayers do have a right to know where is this money going and why.
Apparently, we're funding Zelenskyy's propaganda effort in Ukraine as well. How are we supposed to believe that this qualifies as a free press when it ends up in Ukraine? Because right now, it's not free to the U.S. taxpayers. Now, no wonder the Democrats, as we're finding all of this out as it's being publicized to the American people, and they're really beginning to take it in, slowly but surely. No wonder the Democrats are huffing and puffing. They're running to the courts, and they're pulling stunts outside of federal buildings. It looks a little insurrectiony at times even, because their play pen is being emptied out. Their toys are disappearing one-by-one.
But for us, this is great. It's money saved. It's woke programs axed out. Employees who are not needed have to move on. Radicals on their heels. Every day, it's like Christmas morning, and that's the Angle.
All right. Joining us now, this just in before we get to that from Reuters, the Trump administration plans to keep fewer than it looks like, 294 USAID staff out of over 10,000 staffers in the agency globally.
Joining me now, Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt. Senator, I guess it's about 294 staffers out of about 10,000 to 14,000, we've lost count at this point. That's from, I guess, Marco Rubio's office tonight. That is -- that's got to be the biggest mass firing that we've ever heard of.
SEN. ERIC SCHMITT (R-MO): It's incredible. And I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. I mean, we're just talking about USAID right now. Wait till they get to the other agencies that have been bloated and unaccountable. And this is permanent Washington's worst nightmare, which is why you see this hair on fire moment right now, because they've been able to hide behind this, you know, sort of secrecy for far too long. You mentioned some of these programs. They know that if the American taxpayer knew what this money was being spent on, they would object you'd have sort of a new Tea Party moment in this country, and it's all coming to light, which is a good thing.
We want this fight, Laura. I have a partial list. I just want to read a couple more things. You mentioned the girls-centered climate action in Brazil, 45 million for DEI scholarships in Burma. 1.5 billion for DEI in Serbia. 47,000 for a trans opera in Colombia. 32,000 for a trans comic book in Peru. $2 million for sex changes in Guatemala. That is just the beginning of this stuff.
So I think, you know, this is a really important field, I think for us to fight on. The Democrats are essentially the guardians of permanent Washington right now, and we should welcome this fight.
INGRAHAM: Well, we -- apparently Reuters was the one that confirmed that plan of the Trump administration to essentially delete the department and bring it down to still 300 people. I'm not sure why you need 300 people, but still 300 people out of 10,000, that's quite a cut. Senator, not everybody is happy about this. Bill Gates weighed in on the value of USAID.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL GATES, FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: The USAID plays a super important role in dispensing our aid budget, which is less than 1 percent of the government budget. Its work that saves millions of lives, and you know, helps strengthen relationships for the United States. If you go around --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So, will we not have any relationships with other countries now, because we don't do the slush fund for DEI? And, I mean, there are some water projects probably that are worth funding for people who need help in that regard, but there is a lot of other waste.
SCHMITT: I think that we have to look at this. And Secretary Rubio talked about this too, and President Trump has talked about it writ large. We should only be doing things that are in the core national interest of the United States of America. That's it. And I think what relates to foreign policy or interventionism or foreign aid, we need to have a real reset here. When you have money going, which is also sort of being reported at this hour, going to George Soros, you know, sort of non-profits that who knows where that goes, and it could be coming back here United States to undermine our justice system. This is ridiculous. People have had enough of this, and this is what we mean when we say the election in 2024 was about the disruptors versus the establishment. You're seeing it play out right now in real-time.
There needs to be real reform within these agencies, and we can save hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars, doing the right thing. We can be wearing the white hats here, as Republicans, we should welcome this fight. The Democrats are defending the status quo, which is totally broken.
INGRAHAM: Well, Nancy Mace was exposing brilliantly, the million spent on creating transgender animal experiments, $10 million -- I mean it seems like a joke, it can't be really true, but I guess it is true.
SCHMITT: Well, and what's really interesting is you hear Democrats, basically, when you challenge them on this, they say, well, that's not that much money. That's a drop in the bucket in our budget. Tell that to the truck driver who's working his tail off. Tell that to the waitress who's picking up another shift. Tell that to the family that saves up for a vacation, maybe to come to the nation's capital to show their kids what this place is all about. It's really insulting to taxpayers. So like I said, this is just the beginning. This is one agency right now, and I think that's going to be the benefit of DOGE, which is to dig into all this stuff.
INGRAHAM: No, this is just, it is like, every day is Christmas morning. It's just you can't, you can't get over how much good stuff we're learning -- good stuff about the bad stuff. But it's good that -- knowledge is a good thing for the American public here. Senator, wonderful to see you. Thank you so much.
All right, the party, of course, that forced lockdowns on us and vaxx mandates that canceled student loans and then targeted Christians for political persecution is now supposedly worried about what, oh, a constitutional crisis.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to cut through the B.S., because I am from Detroit, and we like to speak truth to power and be very honest. You know, the American people feel very much we're in a constitutional crisis. They are very much living in fear right now.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a tipping point at which you can't get your democracy back, and I see all of these very purposeful lines of effort that the Trump administration and Elon Musk are taking. And I think we just have to be right now at this moment on, you know, red alert mode.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now, Jonathan Turley, George Washington University Law Prof. and Fox News Contributor. Jonathan, a constitutional crisis, because as a special government employee, Elon Musk and two young computer whizzes are actually finally doing what the government should have done a long time ago, which is a real audit of what they do with our money?
JONATHAN TURLEY, GWU LAW PROFESSOR: No, it is an amazing reaction. You have people all over the beltway breathing in paper bags right now, because the idea that you could bring in these people and they're going to sort of think outside the box. That's what Musk is known for. He's known for someone who rejects past dependence. He did that at Twitter. You know, they said he couldn't fire all those people at Twitter. He did that, and Twitter became more efficient, and the operations continued on impeded. And that was against all the predictions that Twitter would literally shut down because it needed every one of those, or most of those employees.
So Musk is coming in here. And yes, the terror alert in Washington is quite astonishing, but this idea that this is a danger to democracy is rather odd. You have a president, he just ran on a pledge to shrink the government, to look for waste. He brought in someone from the outside for a reason, because past pledges by presidents have gone nowhere in terms of changing the way Washington functions. So he brought in this guy who operates with a different approach.
And look, the truth is, they want people to leave some of these positions. And as I said before you know the fact is that if you throw a badger into a crowded car, people are going to get out, and Musk is that badger. I mean, he threw him in that car, and they're trying to change the way government is composed and is running. But the other thing, by the way, that you were correct on is a lot of what has happened in these court cases is purely speculative. Musk himself does not appear to have had access this information. There's a couple of people they have read only access according to the Treasury Department. But also, they were clever in a number of respects. They took a department, an office that was created by Obama, 2014 they've repurposed it, and they moved it under the executive office. They're not going to get rid of USAID, but apparently they're going to cut it to the bone.
All of that's going to make it more difficult to challenge. So I think that what you're going to see coming out of this is there's going to have to be guarantees to protect things like privacy and other things, and those are important to do. But I find it rather hard to believe that a court is going to micromanage how a president is going to be fulfilling this pledge. He has a right to information to make these decisions.
INGRAHAM: Well, Jonathan, in a lot of these cases that are being filed, whether it's about this deferred resignation, the deadline was supposed to be tonight that you had to tell them whether you wanted to take, basically the buyout. The federal judge pushed that off to Monday. And so Jonathan, the question here is, can we continue to expect Democrats to forum shop in places like the First Circuit up in Boston or Rhode Island, where there is no Republicans on the Appellate Court there, when this thing goes up to be appealed, all these cases, will this continue for these -- they hope nationwide injunctions to be issued against DOGE.
TURLEY: I think it will continue. The fact is that the President has had a rough going with a lot of judges who were not particularly sympathetic when he was a candidate. But ultimately, these cases have to go before the Supreme Court. We have a system of appeal. What's different about this term, as opposed to the one that you and I helped cover the first time Trump was elected, is that Trump is wasting no time. I mean, this is, I mean, I've got to tell you, the entire city is on edge, though, just the pace of these changes, the flurry of executive orders, has everyone reeling.
And there is a reason for that. He knows that the final two years of a second term presidency, everything slows down. You lose a lot of momentum. He wants, if there's going to be challenges, then he's going to invite them, he's going to go into court, and they're going to knock them down, and they're going to get on with this.
INGRAHAM: Yes, well, I hope it doesn't take months or years, because that's what the Democrats are planning to do, drag it out as long as they can. But Jonathan, we'll cover all that with you. Thank you so much as always.
All right, Chicago leaders, they're facing big consequences for trying to stop again the move of common sense into their cities. I'll tell you about it next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Now, we all know that Donald Trump wants to ramp up the pace of deportations from the United States, but you got nearly 400 ICE, DEA, other agents, they fanned out and they went to Aurora, Colorado, it's a hot bed, of course, of that Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. And Fox's Bill Melugin was there to cover the raid.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM HOMAN, BORDER CZAR: God bless you all. Let's take these bad guys off the street. Send to Gitmo, come home safe everyone here.
BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Borders czar Tom Homan rallying the troops ahead of a massive federal operation in Aurora, Colorado, Wednesday morning. Several 100 federal agents from ICE, HSI, DEA, FBI, ATF and CBP.
What's the goal today?
HOMAN: The goal today is send a message to TDA that we're going to eradicate them from this country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: The plan was to deport more than 100 of these gang members. But a little problem, these thugs were apparently tipped off by media reports.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MELUGIN: As the team went door-to-door, they found blood stain walls, but no gang members. The entire complex was virtually empty. A stop at another apartment complex netted no arrests. It seems like they were tipped off. They knew this was coming.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So yes, I do get the impression that there were some intel leaks here, and I think that probably they did know we were coming, but we're still coming. It's not going to stop us.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, as a result, only 30 of these illegal gang members were arrested, only one of which was confirmed, actually confirmed as a Tren de Aragua gang member, and it appears that some of the open borders activists were actually there on the scene. They're not going to thank ICE agents for making the city safer, so they did this.
(VIDEO PLAYING)
INGRAHAM: But this isn't stopping. I don't think ICE is resolved. Border czar Tom Homan has no problem potentially arresting people who get in the way. That's what it comes to.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're shouting and helping these people get away with bull horns. How is that legal?
HOMAN: You're exactly right. They cross the line of impediment (ph), they may find themselves in pair of handcuffs very soon, we're not going to tolerate anymore. This is not a game. When we show up these sites, this is a dangerous job for the men and women of ICE and border patrol and all the DOJ agencies to have that type of interference puts our officer at great risk, not only the officers. It puts the aliens at great risk, because anything can happen when we take our eyes off the goal here.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Now this is the only example of Left-wing interference in ICE raids. The FCC is looking into a local San Francisco radio station that happens to be backed by guess who, George Soros, for revealing live locations of undercover ICE vehicles and agents that were conducting deportation operations in the area. Now it's disturbing to see that, of course, these radical groups make every effort possible to stop the courageous work of our immigration officers that is actually keeping communities safe. But it's also very encouraging that this administration will not put up with it.
Chicago residents are desperate for help in removing illegals from their communities, but their leaders like J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson decided, they know what's best.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): When we're talking about undocumented people, we need to give them an opportunity to stay in this country legally.
BRANDON JOHNSON, CHICAGO MAYOR: We welcome all individuals and families who want to work, live and thrive here in our beloved city. What's clear from this administration is that they do not have the full pulse or the breath of what people in America are calling for.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Perhaps Mayor Johnson should listen to his own constituents, or at least Chicago alderman.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had the ability to work with ICE, they wouldn't be here. The mayor is listening to the constituents that he cares most about, which is hyper liberal white progressives in the city of Chicago.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He believes that he is such a strong advocate for human rights no matter what your citizenship status is that if you're here and you're not a citizen and you're committing heinous crimes, he wants to protect you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Thankfully, Chicagoans have an ally in the White House. The DOJ is suing the city and the state over sanctuary laws and interference with ICE. Joining me now is a resident of Chicago, Vashon Tuncle. Vashon, it's great to see you. Now, we know that your elected officials want, they want to keep Chicago above all else, apparently, a sanctuary for illegal aliens. But what are you seeing within your community about what the residents who deal with this influx are saying.
VASHON TUNCLE, CHICAGO RESIDENT: They absolutely cannot stand the illegal immigrants. I mean, they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime and all sorts of heinous acts, and people are just sick of it, and they love people like Tom Homan because they're cleaning up the city. And let me just remind the people that Brandon Johnson has sworn an oath to the people of Chicago that he must protect us. J.B. Pritzker has sworn an oath to the people of Illinois that he will protect us. And they fail to do that because they're continuously telling us that they will protect the illegal immigrants here, knowing that they're bringing all of the drugs and crime here in our city. That is absolutely ridiculous.
We know that they're doing this because Tom Homan was just here, and he just, you know, he just took away someone that was here since 2009 and if I'm not mistaken, that's during the Obama administration, and he basically had a rap sheet of doing horrendous acts to children. And my question is, why is this guy leaving now in 2025?
INGRAHAM: Well, Vashon, it seems to me that it's time for President Trump to make a trip to Chicago. I really want him to be seen in these blue cities and to deliver a message personally to the people there that I'm here for you. We love America cities we want to help rebuild them. Frankly, focusing on America first. That's what he's -- that's what he's all about. And I think he'd be welcomed if he actually did that. I really -- I think the Left would, you know, kick up a fuss, but I think he would find so many allies in the south side, in Englewood, I think he'd find a lot of support.
TUNCLE: Well, the people of Chicago, we love Trump. I mean, you know, the numbers spoke for themselves during the election, and I just want to say that we actually wanted Trump to come here. We actually loved him here when he was here at the NABJ. So, you know, I don't want these blue lives here to act like Trump isn't welcome here. We love Trump here. We would love Trump to come here in Chicago, Illinois.
And I just want to say that I'm also excited about Pam Bondi being, you know, confirmed as attorney general. Because the man that had the orange jumpsuit at city hall is looking like he's doing a little foreshadowing because it's looking like Brennan Johnson is going to be behind bars pretty soon.
INGRAHAM: Well, she ordered that pause of federal funds to sanctuary cities, and, of course, that's being challenged in court. We'll see how that all plays out. But Vashon, thank you so much. Wonderful to see you as always. And coming up, horrific consequences of the left's gender obsession, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Normal locker room behavior does not involve standing naked facing a doorway.
UNKNOWN: Girls and women, especially, have lost one more layer of protections against physical and psychological harm.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, Richard Cox, a 58-year-old registered sex offender, claims to be transgender and he's accused of spying on women and exposing himself for months in a Virginia high school locker room.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: He was coming out of the women's locker room when I was going into the women's locker room, and I remember looking at him saying, why is there a guy coming out of the women's locker room?
UNKNOWN: This person was clearly a man abusing the rules and refused to use the family locker room, instead sat in our locker room naked and watched us getting dressed and undressed.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: How could something like this actually happen? Well, in Arlington Public Schools, they call it the People's Republic of Arlington, Virginia, for a reason. You can use any bathroom or locker room you want. It's just based off what you feel on that day, your gender identity.
And one of these locker rooms is shared with an aquatic center used by the public. Some of them think a man exposing himself to women and children is just perfectly normal.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: The gender identity of the person who entered the pool locker room is completely irrelevant to this conversation.
UNKNOWN: Sadly, presexual predators exist and will probably happen again. There's not many things we can't do to stop it. In fact, most times you won't even know if a transgender individual is in the locker room with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Ian Prior, America First legal senior advisor and former deputy director of public affairs at DOJ. Ian, now we've been warning about this for years. We knew things like this were happening, could happen. What needs to happen now?
IAN PRIOR, AMERICA FIRST LEGAL SENIOR ADVISOR: Well, what needs to happen is that these school districts in Northern Virginia, and it's not just Arlington, surely, they're one of them, but, you know, Arlington County, Fairfax County, Alexandria, Loudon, Prince William, they all have these same policies. They are all school systems that take federal money and they allow boys to use girls' rooms and locker rooms, which means they are running afoul of Title IX.
And President Trump has made clear there are two sexes in the United States of America, male and female. Which means if you have a policy that says a female has to subject herself to a male invading her private space, the female has to go find alternate arrangements, that is sex discrimination. That is clear and the president has made that clear.
So, these schools better shape up or they are going to lose their federal money.
INGRAHAM: Now the Arlington School Board had an idea to how to stop the sexual predators. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNKNOWN: Prompt action was taken. Based on the community members feedback, we installed signage that reminds all pool patrons to be considerate of others' privacy, cover intimate body areas when using shared spaces, close shower curtains, and follow all locker room etiquette guidance.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Is she kidding me? So, a man in a girl's locker room, she just - - makes sure the curtains pulled. OK.
PRIOR: Look, the fantasy is over, OK? There are not 72 genders. We can stop with that fantasy. We can stop with that fairy tale. They need to actually follow the law. And that's why at America First Legal, we sent actually a letter on Monday to the Department of Education, and we cited this specific issue and said, we need an investigation in these five Northern Virginia school districts.
We've been dealing with this now in Virginia for three years, four years, in Fairfax County really since 2015. The game is over, there's a new sheriff in town, and he has made it very clear that he is going to protect women's spaces, and they better get on board.
INGRAHAM: Now, the DOJ and Civil Rights Office, the DOJ, everybody gets involved fast because this is not going away anytime soon. Ian, thank you. All right, and coming up, a teacher says she was suspended for having a crucifix in her classroom. She's here to tell her story. Next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: If Trump hadn't won, we would have been saddled with a president who thinks the worst of America.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAMALA HARRIS, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: America has a long history of systemic racism.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: But thankfully, we have a president who believes our nation has a divine destiny.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DOANLD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: From the very beginning of our republic, America has always been a nation founded by people of faith and strengthened by the power of prayer, and united by four simple but very beautiful words, in God we trust.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: President Trump today signed an executive order to create a task force to eradicate anti-Christian bias.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The mission of this task force will be to immediately halt all forms of anti-Christian targeting and discrimination within the federal government. In addition, the task force will work to fully prosecute anti- Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: He's talking about defending people like Marisol Arroyo-Castro. She's a Connecticut teacher who says that she was suspended for displaying a crucifix next to her desk. She joins me now along with her attorney, Keisha Russell. Marisol, thanks for joining us.
Now, I know you've had this crucifix displayed for many years, so why has it become a problem?
MARISOL ARROYO-CASTRO, TEACHER: It's a problem because they want me to take it down. The problem because they want Jesus out of the school. Today, I drove by the school and I said, God bless that school because they kicked me out with me and my cross in a box. So, it felt like they didn't want me or Jesus in that school. And I was so saddened by that. I'm still saddened by that.
INGRAHAM: Well, the Consolidated School District of New Britain, the superintendent told the Angle, when students report to us that their teacher is calling them sinners, we investigate fully. And apparently, they claim that the students reported that their teacher is saying they need Jesus. We investigate fully. And basically, went on to say Jewish and Muslim students were told they need Jesus, by you, and that they were falsely worshipping a false god, and it wouldn't be tolerated.
Keisha, your response on behalf of your client there. Did any of that happen?
KEISHA RUSSELL, ATTORNEY: No. And I don't know why the district feels like they need to smear Marisol right now, because the reason why they have put her on paid administrative leave, and they did start by putting her on unpaid leave in December, right before Christmas, and they altered that decision, thankfully.
But she's on paid administrative leave now. And the reason why they threatened to terminate her is over that crucifix. It's because she said she would not take that crucifix down and she wouldn't put it under her desk and she wouldn't put it in her drawer, which are all the options that they gave her.
So, what they're doing now is really just continuing to bully Marisol, because she's standing up for themselves and they don't like it.
INGRAHAM: I mean, this seems like a fairly clear religious liberty issue, and so I don't understand that. I mean, I know for many public schools it's become commonplace for teachers, Marisol, to put up transgender flags, other flags, foreign nations, depending on whether you're studying history, that's altogether appropriate.
But people have made their identities known, their viewpoints known through lots of different types of symbolism. So, their argument, their late-in- the-game argument is that, I guess you're preaching to the students and that's clearly what they're trying to get at.
But they see you and your presence as a threat, which, you know, frankly, again, in this world that doesn't surprise me one bit, but I don't think it's constitutional.
ARROYO-CASTRO: Well --
RUSSELL: It absolutely is not constitutional.
INGRAHAM: Marisol, just the way you feel right now, tonight, given what's happened to you.
ARROYO-CASTRO: Well, I feel like I'm being looked like I'm a bad person. But if, first of all, I would never call anybody a sinner, because we're all sinners. So why would I point that out to anybody?
INGRAHAM: Well, it's an allegation and you don't look like the kind of person who would have done that. So, Marisol, Keisha, thank you so much. We'll continue to stay on this story. Alina Habba coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: There were defining moments from the historic Trump campaign. Like Butler.

INGRAHAM: And Trump at Madison Square Garden. And now there's a defining moment from the first few weeks of this Trump presidency.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That is my favorite image. I love seeing Trump with young people, especially with kids. He loves kids. You can just see it on his face. They were so happy. Now, especially after liberals like billionaire Mark Cuban tried so hard to paint Trump as somehow hostile to women. And everyone from Martina Navratilova now and J.K. Rowling, they noticed what happened at the White House yesterday. And they wondered why a Republican president had to step up and save women's sports.
Joining us now, one of the many women working as top staff in the Trump White House, Alina Habba, counselor to President Trump. Alina, great to see you tonight. Now I thought President Trump was threatened by strong women. It seemed to be a lot of strong women in the White House yesterday, and girls.
ALINA HABBA, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Exactly, exactly, exactly. You and I, we love our strong women and so does President Trump. and more importantly, he's protecting our little girls. And that's what he did, what he did, what he did yesterday. And you saw those children's faces, it was great. They don't have to have men in the bathroom. They don't have to be worried about getting hit in the face by a guy who's twice their size and 17 times their strength. It was ridiculous.
And for once, and not only for once, always, he stands by his women and girls and all, frankly, fairness in sports. And he put an end, as he promised, promises made, promises kept on the campaign.
INGRAHAM: And the NCAA had to make their announcement that, you know, common sense actually has to prevail now, that biological men and boys cannot compete against girls and women, obviously, women by the time you're in NCAA.
But again, as to President Trump's point on this, the fact that he had to do this executive order tells you how radical and far afield, Alina, the Democrats have just turned. It's insanity.
HABBA: You know what's worse to me, Laura, is not that just they've turned. They turned for four years. OK. Then they lost in the most profound way. We swept every state. There was a clear mandate from America that we want what's good, what's God, and what's healthy and right and safety.
And these people are still screaming, Laura. They're screaming. They're going crazy and berserk in the streets of New York. You've got Tish James telling people, oh, hospitals, ignore the executive order on the transgender stuff. You continue doing what you want and you're going to lose your federal funding, but too bad you're under my purview.
This is a derangement the likes of which America has never seen. It's why they lost. It's why they continue to lose. And they will lose again in four years. They are a mess and they don't care about America. They don't care about our kids and they don't care about fairness. They are completely woke, and it is an actual joke. And I just rhymed for you, Laura. Not on purpose.
INGRAHAM: Now, it's actually seems like a mental disorder at this point. I'm sorry it sounds uncharitable. But Alina, I saw that Mark Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO, was leaving the White House late today. Had the chance to talk to him. I know, as did you, during the inauguration. But what was he doing there again? Is he now second best-friend of the president?
HABBA: I'm not going to speak to that, Laura. I'm trying to keep my job in that White House. But let me tell you this. You would be surprised by a lot of the people that we've seen come in here. And you know what that is? That's about strength. That's about them having respect for the presidency. It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat.
I was at the prayer breakfast this morning, the National Prayer Breakfast, and I saw people that tried to persecute President Trump sit in front of him. And that man looked at all of them, just like Zuckerberg, just like Bezos, just like these people that are now surrounding us and helping the cause.
He said one thing, if America could only get the left and the right to sit down and work together, we would be so strong, we could do more than I can do by myself. And that is his message. And I think when you see these people come in, I think they're getting it.
We want to be strong. We want our economy to be strong, and we want to be safe, and people can get behind that. They can't get behind the radical stuff.
INGRAHAM: And we saw that -- he can work with anybody. He wants to work with everybody in the cities and beyond. Alina, I can't believe you didn't give us any scoop from Zuckerberg. Come on, girl. I mean, come on. That's why we have you on. I mean, nothing? You got nothing for me? All right. Alina, thank you so much. Great to see you, as always.
And that's it for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media, of course, on X and Instagram. And thank you for watching. Remember, it's America now and forever, and it's only getting better. Jesse Watters, he takes it from here.
