(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: OK. What? No last name? Good evening, everyone. So, over the weekend, MSNBC canceled Joy Reid's TV show. And according to the network, Oliver wigs were quickly released back into the wild. There they go. When asked about her future plans, Ms. Reid claims she plans on spending more time with her family, accusing her relatives of racism.
Elon Musk said, all federal employees have to send an e-mail saying what they accomplished in the past week. Musk said, I'll start, I fathered five different kids. It's probably true. Hooters is reportedly preparing for bankruptcy. Now, will I get lunch? Asked one man. It's pretty ironic, though, that Hooters is going tits up. I know. You know that was not necessary. I could have just moved on.
Donald Trump is looking to sell off the Nancy Pelosi federal building in San Francisco. It's in pretty good shape too, having been maintained by the same construction company that built her face. Tiny people. A wild brawl broke out at the Spirit Airlines gate at the Atlanta airport. As punishment, every spirit passenger was allowed to board their flight.
After a trans female basketball player missed her game, the team ended up losing by 26 points. But on the bright side, they didn't have to shower in their uniforms afterward. That's a good joke. A large number of Asian voters in San Francisco have announced they are walking away from the Democratic Party. Well, thank God, they're not driving away, or we'd all be in danger.
Applauding a racist? You're terrible. According to Chris Christie, the Trump Administration is a clown car, and after saying that, he left in his car. Finally, the Yankees have lifted their decades-old no facial hair policy. Wow, now I can finally play in New York, said one woman. All right. It's a sad moment for the show. Joy Reid is out. Of course, we're heartbroken for she provided this show with more material than a seamstress at The View. On slow news days, Joy was always there to help with a racist rant. I loved her. Remember these golden oldies?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY REID, FORMER MSNBC HOST: We do have a fascist ground swell in parts of this country, mainly among White men. What they're saying is, we own this country, and everyone will bow down to us. In America, there's a thing about both White vigilantism and White tears, particularly male White tears.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Now, I don't like to use hyperbole, but Joy's firing is the biggest blow to racist since the confederacy lost. Because not only did cable news lose a bigot, but the Bigot herself might finally get the round- the-clock care that she really needs, but you got to wonder how she was able to last this long. The irony, of course, is in her name for did Joy bring any joy to anyone's life? Oh, I didn't know this was a call and response show, but think about it. I'm willing to bet no one ever said.
You know, I was going through a tough period in my life, and listen to Joy Reid really got me through it. If anything, it was their tough periods in life that got them through Joy Reid. But, that's the problem with MSNBC and Legacy Media. Their income was based on making life worse. Instead of focusing on real stuff, they created hoaxes, ones that sow division and hopelessness.
Now Joy's firing came on the heels of MSNBC's parent company, NBCUniversal, settling a $30 million defamation lawsuit with a Georgia gynecologist. I know, Georgia. In 2020, the network reported that the doctor working at an ICE Detention Center was performing unwanted hysterectomies on immigrant women. The network called the doctor, the uterus collector. I know that was my nickname in college. Here's how they reported it,
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just to underscore that, the allegation here is that this is a federal facility, and they have been sending immigrant women in their care, in their custody, to a doctor who has removed their reproductive organs for no medical reason, and without them consenting to it.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nurse says that detained women told her they didn't fully understand why they were undergoing hysterectomies.
CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: You talk about in the complaint a hearing from women who are detained there, talking about a specific doctor performing hysterectomies, referring to him as a uterus collector.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Yeah, Chris Hayes was one of those who peddled this story about the uterus collector, but his only proof was that his was missing. And yes, the story sounds horrible, almost too horrible to be believed. But for people in Legacy Media who suspend common sense on all things Trump, it was just too good to check. It had to be true, but it wasn't.
And the tip off right away is that these hacks would actually condemn a doctor forcibly collecting uteruses, because when it comes to kids, it's lovingly called gender affirmation care. And you think the fact that no one else was reporting this might have been another clue for these great investigative journalists, although calling Nicole Wallace, Chris Hayes, and Rachel Maddow, journalist, it's like calling Stacey Abrams, Jerry Nadler and JB Pritzker plus-size models.
So, how far were they off? Well, the judge in the case states that there's undisputed evidence has been established that there were no mass hysterectomies at the facility, and the doctor is not, quote, a uterus collector. So, other than that, their reporting was perfect. So, MSNBC has reportedly decided to settle up rather than risk a trial. But, you still got to wonder, how this story, this hoax, got this far.
Well, what was the point of the hoax in the first place? To damage Trump and his determination to finally tighten the border. They wanted to believe it was true. You know, like when I told that flight attendant, it was a war injury. The anchors just love the idea that there was a sinister doctor forcibly removing uteruses, so that these women couldn't have kids after entering the U.S.
It's so evil, so fascist, so Trumpian. Seriously, how soon will Hollywood make a movie of that? The evil doctor could be played by Kevin Spacey. Yeah. And the uterus could be played by Peter Dinklage. It makes no sense. Don't try to make sense of it. But again, how do they fall for this garbage?
Well, first, maybe they felt that if they were wrong, of course, no one would check. But also, any belief system is a continuum, and if you go far enough out with it, you can arrive at a very bad place, especially if you already start at a bad place, like, say, Trump is Hitler.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REID: Like Trump, Hitler was also viewed as a clown, a goon who would be -- who could be kept in line. It was blatant fascism meets the Jerry Springer show. If that sounds vaguely familiar, that's because it is similar. Similarities to what happened in Germany and what's happening now in America are just undeniable, violent, terrifying and sometimes bizarre conspiracy theories that set the table for maybe armed resistance to a Kamala Harris win, or mass acceptance of American fascism.
Let me know when you guys are finished fighting amongst yourselves, who I got to vote for in November to keep Hitler at the White House. If it's Biden in a coma, I'm a vote for Biden in a coma.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: You'd vote for Biden in a coma. Why not? You did the same thing in 2020. Meanwhile, coma patients are blinking out Morse code for come on, guys, we're not that bad, but you can see how Joy laid the ground work for the hoax. So, what's left of MSNBC?
Well, they're replacing Joy with a three-person panel. So, if it's a slow news day, they can call each other racist, which raises the other question. Matt Owen the others push the uterus story Reid did not. So, why is Joy fired and the rest of them aren't? Is it because they're all White? I mean, here's a case where Joy can actually cry racism. And finally, for once, it might be true.
Let's welcome tonight's guests. He was in the movie 50 Shades Of White; Fox News contributor, Tom Shillue. Her stances are courageous, and her lap is contagious; host of the Michele Tafoya Podcast, Michele Tafoya. The hospital gown that won't close was his idea; host of AskDrDrew on Rumble, Dr. Drew Pinsky. And she can cover about and make liberals tap out, host of host of Outkick the Morning, Charly Arnolt.
I think we -- I want to just play an up-to-date clip of Joy Reid responding to her firing. Do we have that? Let's play that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REID: And that, I'm sorry, that what I was doing had value, had value,, and in the end, I'm sorry, I try not to cry on TV.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Now I feel sad. I'm just kidding. It's really odd Tom to feel sympathy for somebody who demonized millions of people, who put targets on people's back by calling them racist White supremacists or Tom Shillue.
TOM SHILLUE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, I mean, it was like the only one she let off the hook was Hitler. I didn't know that. You know, that was amazing, that from that monolog, she was like, oh, Hitler was also known as a clown who could be kept in line. I don't remember reading about that, like, what German generals were like, oh, it's a Fiora. He's such a clown.
Didn't happen, but I do now, after seeing her cry, I do feel bad for her. I mean, at least she kept things interesting. I don't know who they're going to replace her with. Maybe, you know we had Jen Psaki, went from the White House to MSNBC. Maybe you know you got Morning Joe. What about evening Joe? Evening Joe, but I mean, evening sleepy Joe? Why not, it'd be like, welcome to no malarkey. It's top stories. I'm still alive. And I don't mean Joe, I mean, like, give the show to me (CROSSTALK).
GUTFELD: I would watch some of that, for sure. So, Michele, do you get a sense that, like, MSNBC, this is not a drastic change. They're unloading the baggage. But, it doesn't feel like, oh, we're moving to the middle with the replacements. I mean, Simone Sanders, Michael Steele, is that his name, Michael Steele? I can't remember, never Trumper, I mean, these are all the same -- it's the same characters.
MICHELE TAFOYA, HOST, MICHELE TAFOYA PODCAST: It's, you know, I came from the NBC family, my most recent television job in sports was the NBC family. And so, I know some of the people who are involved in some of this stuff, and I think that they would like to move at least to the middle. They would like to reflect more of America.
But as you said, I don't know that this trio necessarily does that, because they're all of one mind. But, I want to get to that uterus collector story too, because that name is incredible, right? And it reminds me of Covington. Remember? Our friends, I can't remember his name now.
GUTFELD: Guy won a lot of money on CNN.
TAFOYA: With a lot of money, Salmon, Nicholas Salmon. And it reminds me also of when AOC went to the border and cried, and said that people were drinking water out of toilets.
GUTFELD: Yes.
TAFOYA: Now, that was never proven either. She was allowed to say that.
GUTFELD Yeah. She said it like it was a bad thing.
TAFOYA: But, we also have now, we have George Stephanopoulos and that $15 million settlement about the rape thing, and we've got -- so the lawsuits are starting to kind of pile up, and I think that networks are going, you know, we don't want to have to give away all this money all of the time, and it's hurting us a lot.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
TAFOYA: So, I think there's a lot going on with this network. It's hard for me to see it going too far to the right, but I think, I think some people want to, want to nudge it that way.
GUTFELD: Yeah, I don't see -- you drew your fingers up.
DREW PINSKY, HOST, ASKDRDREW ON RUMBLE: Which means I want to speak, but I -- to follow on what Michele was saying, that this idea -- these hoaxes, with what they are, are two on the nose.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PINSKY: And they have been successful for the last eight years. They've taken things that are so on the nose, they are outrageous and impossible to be true, and somebody has pushed them forward as truth, and they've succeeded. So, they're continuing to run after them until the legal system steps in. Thank God, that physician sued them.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PINSKY: Because, he -- his life could be ruined by -- and these people need to be put on notice. They harm people with the things they say, and that must stop. Also one other things, yeah, big day today. Big day today. This is the day that Keith Olbermann and Greg Gutfeld agree. Read out due to racism.
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. Is that what he said?
PINSKY: He said that.
GUTFELD: Oh my goodness. See, I also think that what we're timing it is, that this came out and you saw all of these liberals getting fired. Do you think that when they saw this, they read the writing on the wall? Charly, you're going to be here all week. It's good if you agree, you should agree with me.
CHARLY ARNOLT, HOST, OUTKICK THE MORNING: No. I mean, of course, I'm going to (inaudible). Of course, I have no other option right now. No, the bar has been set very high. And there is beautiful irony in all of this. You said in the open, I mean, her name's Joy. This news quite literally bringing all of us joy.
GUTFELD: Finally.
ARNOLT: Not to mention, we can't ignore the fact everyone it is Black History Month.
GUTFELD: That's true.
ARNOLT: To be a woman of color and get fired during Black History Month, you really have to be bad.
GUTFELD: Yes. Yeah.
ARNOLT: But, it makes sense, though. I mean, the latest domino to fall, as far as the leftist characters go, Drew you said it, I mean, for years, these people have been able to say exactly whatever they wanted. No one questioned them.
No one could push back, because a) people had no idea what was fact and what was false in some cases, because there was no transparency in our government, so they could get away with murder; and then b) the people that did understand what was real and not were too scared to say anything. But, we've entered such a different era where Trump is not afraid to call BS on anybody. I mean, we're in the golden era, everybody.
GUTFELD: Age. No, it's right, though, her firing, get firing Joy Reid like during Black History Month, that's like firing Chris Christie on Fat Tuesday.
ARNOLT: So, I mean, bye, bye Joy Reid, hello, actual joy.
GUTFELD: Yes. All right. We must move on. Up next, Elon wants proof, federal workers aren't goofs.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: E-mail your accomplishments or leave. Michele, on Saturday, that's a weekend, Elon Musk said, all Fed employees must send an e-mail detailing their accomplishments for the past week. And if they don't, it would be looked at as a resignation. Is this a good way to clean house? Was it fair to do it on a Saturday?
TAFOYA: That's a good question. You do it on a Saturday, maybe you read it on Sunday, although, if you're, you know, a Christian, maybe you don't work on Sunday, I don't know, but here's what the American Federation of Government Employees said, I love this, on so many levels, quote, it is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life, except when he was going to bring those people back from space.
That's from Everett Kelley, said that in a statement, and they're going to challenge any -- you know, this keeps coming back to not what they're being asked, but who is asking it of them. They are -- they want to destroy Elon Musk. And the thing about it is, he's kind of got an F you resume. They can't really destroy him, Greg. He's done a lot of stuff.
GUTFELD: Yep. You know what? If anybody has F you money, it's Elon Musk.
PINSKY: Well, Greg, it's actually f me money.
GUTFELD: Yes, that is true. That is true. Hell, I'd let him inseminate me. It's impossible. Is it? Doctor, I have a doctor here. How soon before I could get pregnant? 20 years, 30 years, and can I do it on Mars? I have a question for you.
PINSKY: You would technically become an inseminated person.
GUTFELD: Yes, that is true. Do you know? OK, here's my question. In business, this is what you do.
PINSKY: Yes.
GUTFELD: This is -- you can't, like, go out -- you have to do the big things, make the mistakes and fix them later.
PINSKY: Chainsaw, not scalpel.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
PINSKY: But, I would say, as if, I think I must be a better employee than these people are complaining, because I would have looked upon this as an opportunity. I'm going to tell him what I do, I'm going to -- I'm going to get it -- now that I'm going to get a promotion, I'm going to see this as an opportunity to get in front of this guy who is reworking things, tell him what I'm think, what I'm doing, let's go do this. Instead, it's like, boo-hoo, that to me, is somebody, I'm sorry, we need you to move along.
GUTFELD: Yeah, I would have written -- I would have written five things. Number one, responding to this e-mail.
PINSKY: There you go.
GUTFELD: Number two, sending the e-mail. Number three, re-reading it in the sent file, and shuffling. For re-reading it again, could I have done that better -- anyway, where am I? So, what did you -- did you -- do you believe that this was maybe like a bird call to find out who really works? Period. like there are people that have positions, but have no presence in the company?
ARNOLT: For sure, and when, you know, Elon Musk was going to get criticized, because he gets criticized for everything that he does. So, his response was, I was just trying to find out who has two neurons in a pulse.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
ARNOLT: By the way.
PINSKY: The starting point.
ARNOLT: And Dr. Drew, you'll respect me, I did my research. Do you know the human brain has approximately 86 billion neurons in it? So, he's setting the bar very low. You just need two neurons. That's it. But unfortunately, people were still going to fail this test, to which I really don't understand, because we know people in the government, they love to lie. So, it's like, just keep doing what you do best and keep lying --
GUTFELD: Exactly.
ARNOLT: -- about your productivity.
GUTFELD: Yeah, it's the one, but it's the one place where you should be lying on e-mails to your boss.
ARNOLT: But, did you see the Trump's response on True Social? He came out with a funny response. It was just kind of like, similar to what you said, he was like, hate Trump, hate Elon, complain about Trump, complain about Elon, hate on these people some more, there you go. There's a little synopsis for you.
GUTFELD: That was better than mine. You're not supposed to do that Charly, remember that?
ARNOLT: Sorry, sorry. I remember. I'm here all week.
GUTFELD: So Shillue, well, can you give me a list of the five things you did last week?
SHILLUE: I tried doing this today. I said, OK, this is so easy. And then, you know, it's not as easy as it looks. So, I was like, one, wrote two jokes that are not good enough for my act. Hopefully, they'll make it into Greg's leftovers on Friday.
GUTFELD: That's where I am, floppy seconds.
SHILLUE: It is. It's hard for someone like me to write down, because what do I really do except make America happy, right?
GUTFELD: Yes.
SHILLUE: Yeah.
PINSKY: Is that for two?
SHILLUE: But, yeah, (CROSSTALK). But, I think it is so funny that the two things he's done so far with DOGE is; one, he said, federal employees have to go to work. They have to physically show up. And two, they have to make a list of five things they did last week. And they totally freaked out. I saw someone on Twitter, and they were like, Dear Mr. Musk, you want me to take an hour out of my busy day to write down a bullet point of what I'm doing? And it's like it takes you an hour to write five things? Like he was proving the point in the e-mail.
GUTFELD: Yes, yeah. Can I -- before -- I want to ask you a question. Do you think, because you were on the Trump train very early, you saw what he was before I did? Do you think that he is too close to Musk? Is he -- is he giving too much over to Musk, or is this a perfect relationship?
SHILLUE: Well, I think it's a perfect relationship, because he can always jettison him. If Musk gets on his bad side, you know, Trump is just going to be like, overrated. Right?
GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah.
SHILLUE: Like he -- he can't be, and that's why I don't think Trump, if people are like, Trump is going to get mad, he's upstaging him. And Trump's like, he's not upstaging. This is the new Trump. I think in his first term, Trump would not have sat there while Elon Musk went on for an hour and his Kid picked his nose and wiped it on the desk.
GUTFELD: Yes.
SHILLUE: Trump wouldn't let that happen. But now, he's like, I don't care. I'm having a good time.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
ARNOLT: Well, one other thing that needs to be said is, this is a little bit like deja vu, because remember when, when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, the first thing he did was he fired 80 percent of the people working there.
GUTFELD: Yeah.
PINSKY: He know how to do that.
ARNOLT: And found out that the output didn't change at all. So, I have to imagine the same is going to happen in Washington.
GUTFELD: Did that need to be said?
ARNOLT: I feel like it did.
GUTFELD: Yeah. You're in the seat now, Charly. Up next, (inaudible) bleeding heart is still the opposite of smarts.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(SINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's coming your way, hey, hey. It's Video of the Day.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: The head from Hanoi still manages to annoy. Speaking of Jane Fonda, she used her lifetime achievement award speech at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to push Hollywood to stand up to Trump and defend all things woke. Roll it, Rhonda.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JANE FONDA, ACTRESS: Make no mistake, empathy is not weak are woke. And by the way, "woke" just means you give a damn about other people.
(APPLAUSE)
FONDA: Back to empathy, a whole lot of people are going to be really hurt by what is happening, what is coming our way. And even if they are of the different political persuasion, we need to call upon our empathy and not judge but listen from our hearts and welcome them into our tent, because we are going to need a big tent to resist successfully what is coming at us.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Good luck finding a tent, Jane. They are all out of stock in L.A. for obvious reasons.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: There is your empathy, lady.
And later, Fran Drescher, president of the Screen Actors Guild and perhaps high as a kite had thinly veiled words for the current administration.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FRAN DRESCHER, SAG PRESIDENT: When man versus man, unspeakable acts of violence and destruction are justified by maniacal, ego-driven thought. When man versus nature, nature will always win. As we experienced on January 7th 2025, when extreme wind, then fires made for a lethal and disastrous inferno, followed by torrential rains, floods, mudslides, and earthquakes.
Wake up, humans. We can't let greed continue to deny global warming.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
(BOOS)
GUTFELD: Hold on, she can't hear you.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: It's funny, she references the fires but never the government in charge that led to it, run by a progressive mayor who obeyed every woke commandment. It is kind of scary that they defined what they do is empathy, they do it in a city plagued by homelessness, crime, drug addiction, and the devastations of preventable disasters, all of it resulting from their policies that they defend proudly as woke. I mean, if that's compassion, what are they like when they aren't compassionate? I have a feeling we're about to find out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Period!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Dr. Drew, I look at Jane Fonda and I go there is one old lady.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But there is no wisdom. Generally, when you get older the wisdom comes with you, and like she was -- nothing that she said was rife with being on earth. You know what I mean?
PINSKY: No experiential learning.
GUTFELD: No experiential -- how is that possible?
PINSKY: I don't know how people do that, but she has done it. But your point about the tents is exactly the correct points. It's toxic empathy. It's a new term. This is toxic empathy. We don't -- when I empathize with the patient, I go, come with me. We stand firm against your illness. We do all kinds of unpleasant work with you that you don't like, otherwise you would get better on your own. And giving them the rigs and the tents and the heroin is a death sentence. That's toxic empathy.
And the idea that the only kind of empathy, the only way to deal with people is the way we say you deal with people, that is grandiose narcissism, period. And the reality is you can be deeply concerned about humans and not be interested in doing it the way Jane Fonda thinks we should do it.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: It is kind of amazing. I guess like that fires are only may be a month or so ago, and they are like -- they've moved onto something that is far worse, and that is a Trump. Trump has not caused any fires. He was trying to prevent them years ago.
ARNOLT: I mean, talking about a month. It blows my mind that Trump is only been in office for a month, because the amount he has been able to get done in one month --
(APPLAUSE)
ARNOLT: -- was a more than Joe Biden was able to accomplish in four years. And on top of that he also has to work on reversing so much of the damage that was done over the last administration. You know, DEI, it was never about diversity in the beginning. It was about lowering standards for people. And if you truly do care about people, contrary to Jane Fonda's point, you want the highest of standards for them. And that is finally what we're getting in this country.
And Jane Fonda, I know that at one point, I'm looking at her now, I know she was highly respected for her workout tips, but I feel like the amount of people who are coming to her now for workout advice are the same people who care about her political views, which is close to none at this point.
GUTFELD: They applauded her in that room, Tom, but of course, she is a legend. That's what happens when you get older. You immediately become a legend because you just happened to outlive people.
(LAUGHTER)
SHILLUE: And what she was saying was a bunch of nonsense, although she looks and sounds, I have got to give her credit, she is five years older than Biden.
GUTFELD: No, yes, I agree. I agree. Very strong, very -- yes. But wrong.
SHILLUE: Yes, wrong. She has gotten dumber than when she was Hanoi Jane. At least then --
GUTFELD: She was hot, too.
SHILLUE: Yes, but she was like a real hippy at the time. But now she is super rich and she's talking about compassion. And what is she doing for these people that she talks about being compassionate about. Very clueless. But this is the way they are. They don't, they don't know anything about politics. Even the ones I like. I love Paul McCartney, but I saw him the other day talking about A.I. And he has been around for so long, and he just doesn't ever think about. He was like, A.I. you've to protect to the artists. The art, you've got to protect the artists. The people out there making the laws, write in something for the artists.
(LAUGHTER)
SHILLUE: He thinks like people who make laws, they are really smart. He just trusts them. He is like, throw something for the artists? It is ridiculous. They don't know about the world.
GUTFELD: Yes. Do your impression of George Harrison. Perfect!
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Sorry.
Michele, I guess this is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's not surprising. She is in the audience. They expect this, they will go along with it. But --
TAFOYA: Is it just me or did Dran Drescher sound a little bit like Kamala Harris there?
GUTFELD: Yes, I think they have the same prescription.
TAFOYA: The same prescription, same writer.
ARNOLT: Same box wine.
TAFOYA: The world, it's melting, and there is rain, and I must pad my paddy feet on the sand before there is an earthquake which is brought on by greed and climate change. Earthquakes are not caused by climate change.
GUTFELD: Nothing is.
TAFOYA: I mean it's just, it was crazy. But yes, I kind of thought, you never see Fran and Kamala in the same room.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You've got to watch the whole Fran Drescher speech. It's insane.
TAFOYA: I don't know if I can take it. You called it toxic empathy. It's also Gad Saad, our friend, calls it suicidal empathy because also you bring in conditions that are kind to some people, and others get murdered. Or you bring and certain immigrants to Germany and a bunch of people get ploughed over by a car by an immigrant. So there is the toxic and there's the suicidal.
GUTFELD: There you go. Both are bad for you, by the way.
TAFOYA: They are.
GUTFELD: Don't try that at home, kids.
Coming up, refreshment candor from the human salamander.
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got another clip of you. It's Video of the Day Part Two.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Democrat advice from the man who eats mice.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Three-hundred-year-old viper James Carville went on Dan Abrams podcast to talk about what the Dems need to do to counter Trump and how 47's entire operation is teetering on disaster. Roll it, Doris.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: What I have said very publicly, I said Democrats need to play possum. This whole thing is collapsing. It doesn't need Elizabeth Warren and somebody screaming to pacify some progressive advocacy groups in Washington, which by the way, I wish these people were just useless. They're actually worse than useless. They are detrimental. And they never ever learn to shut up.
I believe that this administration and less than 30 days is in the midst of a massive collapse, and particularly a collapse in public opinion.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Show that picture of him again. Do you know what it is like? It's like he is talking to a spider. He gets really close to the creative. Charly, but he makes a really good point. Just don't -- just shut up. That's what he's saying, shut up. You are embarrassing to yourselves.
ARNOLT: Obviously. But he is embarrassing himself, too, on a very frequent basis. I just recall when he told everybody that Kamala was going to be Trump in the elections. He is just one of those people that for some reason it is still considered a meaningful guest and a meaningful opinion when he really isn't really making sense most of the time. And just for him to say that Trump's White House is going to collapse in the next 30 days, I guess it just raises a good question, and maybe Dr. Drew, you would be the one to answer it. Is his life expectancy that long?
PINSKY: James? Interesting question.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Tom, my theory is that Carville is right, because who is more likely to get hit by lightning, somebody who is sitting in their coach at home or somebody who goes out at night for a run? Anybody who actually takes action puts themselves at risk. And this is an administration that is always an action, always in play. A lot like you on the weekends.
SHILLUE: That is. You've got to look hard to see insight into what Carville says. I don't know how he became the wiseman of politics.
ARNOLT: Nostradamus.
SHILLUE: It's always, he's always making these weird illusions, where I come from, where I come from.
(LAUGHTER)
SHILLUE: You've got to get down with Republican Party. Get down in the deck with the catfish and the crawdads.
(LAUGHTER)
SHILLUE: I tell you, Republican, you are fishing without bait.
PINSKY: Thank God Tom has got something to do now that Joe Biden is gone.
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Yes. He's right.
What do you think, Michele?
TAFOYA: You're asking me to follow that, first of all.
If it's about to collapse, someone needs to tell the Harvard-Harris poll, because they are saying Americans love what is going on, that they are taking a hatchet to all of this stuff.
(APPLAUSE)
TAFOYA: By the way, I think this is how Carville is recording that stuff, because a look at him. He's got to be sitting on his couch like this, and just kind of talking like this. I think that's what he's doing.
GUTFELD: I'm trying to figure that out. Doc, what is your last word on this?
PINSKY: I want to see Michele do that pose again.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: You little pervert.
TAFOYA: Later, tootsie roll.
PINSKY: He's been spot on, and so far he's been the only honest opinion out there that I have heard from that party in quite some time, so I want to hear more. If public opinion dips, he'll say, see, I was right.
GUTFELD: All he needs is one catastrophe, and bad things always happen in the beginning of a presidency. There's always something that happens. And so he's just playing the odds. It's going to make him look smart, but odds are something will happen. It will be out of the administration's control, but it will happen. So just get ready for it, people.
ARNOLT: I don't see it happening.
GUTFELD: OK.
PINSKY: Especially with so much box shaking going on.
GUTFELD: Yes, shaking the box, something is about fall out of that box. It's going to be a salamander, headless salamander.
Up next, is the period in a sentence causing repentance?
(APPLAUSE)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five more words.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(APPLAUSE)
GUTFELD: Periods in texts are obnoxious. Tom, A new study shows that periods in text messages, especially after each word, makes the text seem more emotionally intense. What does that tell you about that person?
SHILLUE: I agree. I don't like punctuation in texts. But my wife writes her texts like she is typing a letter. So she'll write the whole thing. She'll put quotes. She'll put exclamations. I'm like, you are working too hard on the texts.
GUTFELD: Yes.
SHILLUE: You have to just send it, just run on sentences, no punctuation.
GUTFELD: Yes. Michele, I just voice text, so it makes absolutely no sense at all.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: That way if I say something that is morally objectionable, I just say --
TAYLOR: Oops. It corrected me on accident. I do the voice text, but I get made fun of, because I will say dear so-and-so, quote, da-da-da-da, dot, dot, dot, period, colon. I do the whole bit. But as east as that, that looks terse. Call me please. I mean, that's what that comes across as.
GUTFELD: That's like an urgent matter, Doc. Is that, again, narcissistic behavior?
PINSKY: No, it's being old. And --
(LAUGHTER)
PINSKY: Although, Tom, pretty spry with the run on sentences. But I make the ultimate transgression, particularly to our friend, Kat Timpf, which drives her insane and she has set my record straight many times. I pick up the phone and I call her.
That is, God forbid to. I refuse not to call people I want talk to them.
GUTFELD: No one sounds more miserable than Kat Timpf answering the phone it. Is this how I hold it? Hello.
PINSKY: Unless we talk about "Teen Mom." Then she's --
GUTFELD: Yes, that's how you two bonded.
Charly, you're young one, almost 40. That's a joke.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I have no idea how old you are. You're ageless. Do you use periods like this when you're mad?
ARNOLT: I do. I use really good punctuation when I am texting. I'm the same as you. I say, "dot, dot, dot", and I do the whole thing. But for if someone says call, period, me, period, please, period, I'm less afraid than if somebody says call me, please. That feels more aggressive and just like little more passive. I'm like ahh -- I don't want passive-aggressive. I like --
GUTFELD: The worst -- any woman that writes "Can we talk?"
ARNOLT: You don't want that.
GUTFELD: What does it mean when a man of writes you and says can we talk? Then that's like --
PINSKY: It means he wants to talk.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes. That is why he's the doctor.
We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Tom Shillue, Michele Tafoya, Dr. Drew, Charly Arnolt, our studio audience. FOX NEWS AT NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
(APPLAUSE)
