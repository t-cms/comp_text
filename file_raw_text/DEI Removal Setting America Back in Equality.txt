We, the editorial staff of The East Carolinian, believe that the DEI removal by President Donald Trump sets America back on its mission of equality. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs were created to ensure fair opportunities for all Americans, regardless of their race, gender, or background. By taking away these programs, the Trump administration is ignoring the barriers that negatively impacted marginalized communities from a variety of opportunities including education, employment, and housing.
Some would argue that DEI only furthers division and prioritizes some groups over others. However, no one can deny the progress that has been made by these efforts. Even creating institutions aimed at addressing DEI proves that people are at least acknowledging the issue and attempting to solve it. Even at ECU, DEI has fostered inclusive environments and provided many pathways for students to succeed. 
Eliminating DEI sends a message about whose voices are values in America. These programs were designed to create a level playing field for all. Without them, people may struggle to gain access to the same opportunities as others. Years of work has been undone with these policy removals.
Removing DEI measures does not make things more fair. As students and people, we recognize that America promises a land of opportunity and justice for all. With these rescinded policies, those opportunities are disappearing by the day.
