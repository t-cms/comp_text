Donald Trump has threatened to sue writers who use anonymous sources or off-the-record quotes in books and in the media in general, claiming they are made up and the people often do not exist.
The president even suggested creating a "NICE NEW LAW" to stop the practice, which would likely immediately run into First Amendment court challenges.
Here's what he wrote on Truth Social this morning: 
As a President who is being given credit for having the Best Opening Month of any President in history, quite naturally, here come the Fake books and stories with the so-called "anonymous," or "off the record," quotes. At some point I am going to sue some of these dishonest authors and book publishers, or even media in general, to find out whether or not these "anonymous sources" even exist, which they largely do not. They are made up, defamatory fiction, and a big price should be paid for this blatant dishonesty. I'll do it as a service to our Country. Who knows, maybe we will create some NICE NEW LAW!!!

As Donald Trump prepares to hold his first cabinet meeting today, with Elon Musk, a non-cabinet member, in attendance, the president wants to ensure everyone is on message.

A legal challenge has been filed against a Trump administration directive that gave schools and universities two weeks to eliminate any "race-based" practices or risk losing federal funding.
The lawsuit, brought in Maryland by the American Federation of Teachers union and the American Sociological Association, alleges that the Education Department's memo, issued on February 14, violates the First and Fifth Amendments.
The plaintiffs argue that the memo forces schools to only teach views supported by the federal government, which infringes on free speech.
They also claim the directive is too vague, leaving schools uncertain about which practices would be considered in violation.

Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement yesterday saying that the Trump administration had fired nearly 6,000 veterans since it began gutting federal agencies.
"Our veterans make significant sacrifices in service of our country, but those sacrifices do not seem to matter to President Trump and unchecked billionaire Elon Musk," DeLauro wrote.
"They are an essential part of our federal workforce, bringing their expertise to every single agency. 
"Republicans are turning their back on them, allowing Musk to fire at least 6,000 veterans and leave them with no way to feed their families or keep a roof over their heads."

"WHCA has determined pools for decades because only representatives FROM our outlets can determine resources all those outlets have - such as staffing - in order to get the President's message out to the largest possible audience, no matter the day or hour."

In case you missed this one, Kyiv and Washington have agreed to the terms of a rare earth minerals deal after days of tension between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.
Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement on jointly developing its mineral deposits, including oil and gas, after the U.S. dropped demands to the rights of up to $500bn in revenue from the resources, according to sources close to negotiations.
Trump last week demanded preferential access to the $500bn figure as repayment for Washington's military support for Ukraine under his predecessor Joe Biden.
Zelensky rejected the proposal as "not serious", saying there was no factual basis for claiming the U.S. was owed that money, as well as the deal providing Ukraine with no security guarantees.

Trump to sell citizenship via $5m 'gold cards' to wealthy foreigners who create jobs

The president announced a new path to U.S. citizenship yesterday: a pricey gold card.
The U.S. is going to "sell" gold cards for $5 million, Trump announced in the Oval Office.
"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that's going to give you [permanent resident] Green Card privileges, plus it's going to be a route to citizenship," the president said. 
He branded it as "somewhat like a Green Card, but at a higher level of sophistication."
"Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card," Trump continued. 
"They'll be wealthy and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people. And we think it's going to be extremely successful and never been done before."
Asked who exactly would be eligible for the scheme, the president joked: "Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. 
"They are not as wealthy as they used to be; I think they can afford $5 million."
Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick clarified the Trump administration plans to terminate a somewhat similar EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program and "replace it with the Trump gold card."

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted to adopt a budget framework supported by GOP leadership and President Donald Trump on Tuesday, allowing Speaker Mike Johnson to hold on to his image as a unifiying voice among Republicans in the chamber.
Johnson and Rep Jodey Arrington, the House GOP's lead appropriator, were able to win over several key holdouts within the Republican Party who felt that the plan did not do enough to cut federal spending. Thomas Massie was the only Republican to vote against the legislation after several others fell back into line.
Leadership initially abandoned plans to call a vote on the bill Tuesday evening, then dragged lawmakers back to the floor more than an hour after the bill was originally scheduled to be taken up. It was then defeated by a vote of 217 to 215.

Members of the Congressional DOGE Caucus spoke at a press conference outside the Capitol about how they are working in Congress to enshrine the changes spearheaded by Trump and Elon Musk.
When asked about federal employees who had been fired, Rep. Ralph Norman said, "Why are they not pleading their case?"
The South Carolina Republican said the fired employees needed to justify why they deserve a job with an average salary that tops $100,000.
And veterans? "Our heart aches," for anyone who loses their job, said Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., the caucus co-chair.
"There are other opportunities, and if anybody can overcome obstacles getting another job, it's veterans," Bean said.
As the lawmakers took turns at the podium, a small group of protesters and passersby interrupted, yelling insults about DOGE and Musk.

The notice stipulates the aid workers must pass through security screening. It lists multiple paragraphs of prohibited weapons for the trip back to the office, including firearms, dynamite, spear guns or ice picks.
