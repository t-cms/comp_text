Radical Indoctrination Has No Place In K-12 Schools
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Independent Women applauds President Donald J. Trump for his Executive Order titled Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling, which will ensure that schools no longer have the ability to use federal funds to advance a discriminatory agenda that divides Americans, fails students, and circumvents parental rights.
This executive order comes on the heels of a broad effort to extract so-called DEI ideology from the federal government and to enforce civil rights restrictions on discriminatory practices in the private and university sectors.
While states still bear the primary responsibility for curriculum decisions, federal civil rights law and other federal statutes designed to protect parents' rights preclude the use of federal funds at institutions that employ racially discriminatory practices and agendas or hide important medical information from parents about their children.
"This EO ensures that the promise of colorblind education guaranteed by the Civil Rights Act and the basic assumption of parents' right to know what's being taught and done to their children at school are upheld," explained Independent Women's Senior Policy Analyst Inez Stepman.
"If schools choose to teach discriminatory and anti-American lessons - an agenda that is deeply unpopular with the American people and was rejected at the ballot box - they must do so without the additional funds supplied by the federal government."

Independent Women's Forum is dedicated to developing and advancing policies that aren't just well intended but actually enhance people's freedom, choices, and opportunities.
