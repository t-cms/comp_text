Rep. Cory Mills, R-Florida, issued the following news release:
In an effort to codify and enact into law President Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government, Representative Cory Mills (FL-07) introduced the DEI to DIE Act (H.R. 800). This bill would direct the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Personnel Management, and Attorney General to coordinate the termination of all DEI mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government.
"I am proud to introduce the DEI to DIE Act, which will enact President Trump's executive order for a comprehensive government ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. We will correct the failures caused by prioritizing woke policies by dismantling DEI-driven programs that have weakened government efficiency and imposed divisive ideologies under the Biden Administration. This includes strengthening military readiness, improving the U.S. Secret Service's protective efforts, and fixing education programs that have placed ideology above academic achievement," said Rep. Cory Mills (FL-07).
"By restoring merit-based hiring and standards, we are prioritizing performance and unity, we will restore fundamental American principles, and keep national security as our top priority."
