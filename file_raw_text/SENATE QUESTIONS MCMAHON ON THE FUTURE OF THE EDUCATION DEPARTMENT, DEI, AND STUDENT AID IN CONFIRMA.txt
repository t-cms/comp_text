The following information was released by the American Council on Education:
In a closely watched Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday, Linda McMahon, President Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education, faced pointed questions on both K-12 and higher education policy.
While Democrats pressed her on the administration's plans for the department, she also received solid backing from the Republican majority. Among the issues under scrutiny:
The Future of the Education Department
Although the president has recently called the department "a big con job" and said he wants it closed "immediately," Inside Higher Ed reported that McMahon told lawmakers that she would not shut it down unilaterally.
However, the Trump administration has already begun downsizing staff and eliminating research programs within the department, which aligns with a broader push to reduce federal oversight of education and shift decision-making to the states. While McMahon emphasized her support for this shift, she acknowledged that only Congress has the authority to formally dissolve the department. The Washington Post noted that many Senate Democrats challenged the practicality of eliminating the department while continuing to oversee key programs such as Pell Grants and Title I funding.
Cuts to Education Research and DOGE's Role
A major flashpoint of the hearing was the Trump administration's decision to cancel nearly $900 million in federal education research contracts. The cuts, orchestrated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), primarily target the National Center for Education Statistics, which produces critical data on student outcomes, financial aid, and institutional performance. Without this funding, key research effortssuch as the National Postsecondary Student Aid Studymay be halted or significantly delayed, raising concerns about the loss of essential data used to inform policy decisions.
While McMahon dismissed concerns over these cuts, calling them part of a broader effort to streamline government operations, DOGE's interference in education policy undermines the department's ability to function effectively. Several senators pushed back, pointing out that funding decisions should be made by Congress, not through executive action.
DEI Policies Under Scrutiny
According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, McMahon largely avoided directly answering questions about Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in federally funded institutions. When asked whether student identity-based clubs would violate the order, she said she would "want to know what the clubs are doing" before making a determination.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) pressed McMahon on whether African American history courses could be at risk, to which she responded, "I'm not quite certain. And I'd like to look into it further and get back to you on that." The New York Times and NPR noted that McMahon's lack of clarity left school administrators uncertain about how to navigate the new policies.
Campus Antisemitism and Potential Funding Cuts
Republican senators repeatedly raised concerns about antisemitism on college campuses, calling student protesters "crazy" and arguing that universities have failed to protect Jewish students. McMahon responded that institutions failing to address antisemitic incidents could face loss of federal funding. She also endorsed Trump's executive order allowing for the revocation of student visas for international students who participate in protests the administration deems antisemitic. However, she did not provide details on how these policies would be enforced, particularly given that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is already struggling with a backlog of cases.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that McMahon is open to creating a federal commission on antisemitism in higher education but did not provide details on how enforcement would work. The Washington Post highlighted concerns that the policy could have implications for free speech on campus.
Accreditation and Higher Education Oversight
Accreditation received brief attention during the hearing. Inside Higher Ed noted that Sen. Ashley Moody (R-FL) asked McMahon to review regulations surrounding accreditation, arguing that current standards impose excessive federal oversight on institutions. Florida has been in a legal fight to challenge the constitutionality of accreditation rules, and McMahon appeared sympathetic to reviewing the regulatory framework. However, she did not commit to specific policy changes.
Expanding Workforce Pell and Alternatives to Traditional College
Several outlets, including The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Washington Post, highlighted McMahon's emphasis on workforce training. She expressed strong support for expanding Pell Grants to short-term workforce programs and apprenticeships.
McMahon also suggested that expanding federal funding for technical education could "stimulate our economy" and help students enter the workforce more quickly. However, NPR reported that she provided few specifics on how the expansion would be implemented or regulated.
Student Loans and Federal Student Aid Management
McMahon pledged to uphold existing student loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). However, The New York Times pointed out that the Trump administration previously rejected nearly all PSLF applicants, raising questions about how McMahon would handle the $1.7 trillion federal student loan portfolio.
Meanwhile, reports have emerged that DOGE officialsincluding a 19-year-old staffer previously fired for leaking datahave gained access to sensitive student loan and financial aid records at the department. This has raised concerns about student privacy, particularly for undocumented and mixed-status families. A federal judge has temporarily blocked DOGE's access to the data following a lawsuit by University of California students, but the ruling is only a short-term reprieve.
Title IX, Gender Policies, and Campus Speech
McMahon voiced support for Trump's executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on teams aligned with their gender identity. She also praised a recent court decision blocking the Biden administration's attempts to expand gender identity protections under Title IX.
Meanwhile, President Trump has nominated Kimberly Richey, senior chancellor of the Florida Department of Education, as assistant secretary for civil rights. Richey, who previously served in the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights during the first Trump administration, is expected to lead efforts to enforce the administration's transgender athlete ban.
Looking Ahead
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is scheduled to vote on McMahon's nomination on Feb. 20. With a Republican majority in the Senate, her confirmation is likely.
