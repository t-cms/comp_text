Officials from the Trump administration and from Russian President Vladimir Putin's delegation are meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, today for talks on ending Moscow's war in Ukraine.
The war-hit European nation has said that no peace deal can be made on its behalf at the talks, to which it was not invited. 
The two sides are nevertheless expected to discuss ways to end the conflict as its third anniversary approaches.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will travel to Saudi Arabia tomorrow but that his trip is unrelated to the U.S.-Russia talks.

Michelle King, the Social Security Administration's (SSA) acting commissioner, stepped down from her role at the agency over DOGE's requests to access Social Security recipient's private personal information.
Acting Commissioner King's departure from the agency over the weekend - after more than 30 years of service - was initiated after King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to sensitive data, according to the Associated Press.
Here's White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attempting to spin it:
Leavitt: President Trump has directed Elon Musk and the DOGE team to identify fraud at the social security administration. They've not dug into the books but they suspect there are tens of millions of deceased people who are receiving fraudulent social security payments

According to a filing signed by Joshua Fisher, director of the Office of Administration at the White House, Mr Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.

Military base schools pull civil rights history after Trump DEI threat

The federal education system that supports Defense Department schools around the world has ordered institutions under its purview to remove books from their libraries that deal with any topic relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) following Trump's executive order on the subject.
The missive from the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) was issued on February 6, forcing schools - like the elementary institution in the U.S. Army's Fort Campbell base in Kentucky - to round up books that don't align with the Trump administration's ideological views (presumably including Julianne Moore's innocuous children's book we mentioned earlier).
The order demands that employees at 161 elementary and high schools around the world "ensure compliance with executive orders and recent DoDEA guidance."
But the order is reportedly being broadly interpreted by librarians and school officials to include any books dealing with issues that could be perceived as promoting one group over another - meaning that books about slavery, civil rights history or treatment of Native Americans could be removed.

Judge to hear arguments today on granting DOGE access to sensitive data
Monday 17 February 2025 16:10
,
Joe Sommerlad
A U.S. judge has scheduled a rare holiday court hearing on Monday in a case brought by Democratic state attorneys general seeking to protect major federal agencies from Elon Musk's government cost-cutting team DOGE.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C., has called the hearing for Presidents Day when federal courts are typically closed.
She did not say why she ordered the hearing but on Friday she heard arguments by 13 Democratic state attorneys general for a temporary restraining order that would bar Musk's DOGE team from accessing information systems at several government agencies including the departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services, Energy, Transportation, Commerce, and the Office of Personnel Management.
DOGE has swept through federal agencies since Trump became president last month and put Musk in charge of rooting out wasteful spending as part of Trump's dramatic overhaul of government, which included thousands of job cuts on Friday.
The attorneys general also asked the judge to prevent Musk and DOGE team members from firing government employees or putting them on leave.
They have requested the order to last for 14 days, giving them time to file legal briefs in pursuit of a more permanent order.
Chutkan did not issue a ruling at Friday's hearing.
The states argue that Musk wields the kind of power that can only be exercised by an officer of the government who has been nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
The states also allege DOGE has not been authorized by Congress.
Around 20 lawsuits have been filed in various federal courts challenging Musk's authority, which have led to differing results in two initial rulings.
U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas in New York extended a temporary block on DOGE on Friday that prevented Musk's team from accessing Treasury systems responsible for trillions of dollars of payments. 
But also on Friday, U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington declined a request by unions and nonprofits to temporarily block Musk's team from accessing records at the departments of Labor, and Health and Human Services, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Tate and his brother Tristan, who have dual American and British citizenship, were arrested in 2022 and charged with human trafficking, sexual misconduct, money laundering and running an organized crime group but have since become a pet cause of the online right. The siblings have denied wrongdoing.
Their case was first raised by U.S. officials in a phone call with the Romanian government last week and then followed up by Richard Grenell, Trump's special envoy and now interim Kennedy Center boss, when he met the Romanian foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference.

The Vice President has hit out at Margaret Brennan, host of Face the Nation, after she asked Marco Rubio on her show yesterday what Vance had accomplished by warning Europe against censorship in his speech to the Munich Security Conference last week and meeting with the leader of the far-right political group Alternative for Germany.
Rubio questioned why allies would be annoyed by the Veep using his own freedom of speech to offer an opinion on the state of European laws.
"Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct genocide, and he met with the head of a political party that has far-right views and some historic ties to extreme groups," Brennan countered. 
"The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that."
Rubio responded: "Well, I have to disagree with you... Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. 
"The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities."
Vance himself has since weighed in accordingly:
This is a crazy exchange.
