Stress impacts academic as students struggle to balance school, work

A recent university study about stress shows that working while in school is a huge contributor to stress- and some PNW students agree.
"Working gets in the way of how hard I would like to work on my assignments and the amount of time I have to study," said Ava Kulig, a sophomore studying Finance and Accounting.
A survey of more than 5,000 college students found two in five (43%) of students say stress impacts their ability to focus, learn and perform well academically "a great deal." Another 42% say stress impacts them at least "some." The survey, conducted for Insider Higher Ed, also found that 70% of students said their number one source of stress was balancing their academic and personal lives. 
Sophomore Elementary Education major Maegan Deel said striking the right balance can be hard.
"It's challenging to make sure I show up to work for my shift feeling energized right after my classes from school," she said. 
Deel is a swim instructor and needs to make sure she is in the right state of mind before she shows up to work.  Sometimes, switching her mind from school to work and back causes turmoil.
 "A challenge of balancing school while working is having to complete assignments tired," she said. "I have to make sure I still complete all of my homework at night after I am done with my shift at work."
Though there are challenges, Deel and Kulig each have their own way to manage the stress.
Deel relies on a support system that helps her handle everything that comes with working while in school. 
 "I receive enough family support thankfully," she said. "I also find the strength to do both work and school because of my faith."
Kulig takes a more hand-on approach.
 "I make lists for each day and like to plan things weeks ahead of time so I know when I need to start studying for my classes," she said. "Even though I am still stressed sometimes, having everything planned out in advanced helps me a lot."
