The Pacific Legal Foundation issued the following news release on Jan. 22, 2025:
Yesterday, President Trump issued two sweeping executive orders revoking decades of "radical and wasteful" diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.
"President Trump's Executive Order ending DEI policies and offices throughout the executive branch was a significant win for Americans of all stripes. President Biden's decision to inject race and equity into all aspects of federal government was as wasteful as it was divisive. President Trump's Order marks a return to sanity where the executive is concerned with doing the best for all Americans regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, or other immutable characteristics," said Joshua Thompson, a senior attorney at Pacific Legal Foundation.
"The President's Executive Order ending discrimination in federal contracting is also long overdue. What was once justified as a means to remedy past intentional discrimination has far outlived that lofty goal. Modern federal contracting policies solely seek to make sure all races have equal outcomes rather than equal treatment, which turns equality before the law on its head. Kudos to President Trump for taking the first steps to end these pernicious, wasteful, and unconstitutional policies once and for all. Americans should be treated equally, and taxpayers are entitled to the best work regardless of the skin color of the contractors."
