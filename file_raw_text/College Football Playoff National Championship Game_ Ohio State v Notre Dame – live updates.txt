 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 9:34 4th quarter 
Greathouse on a crossing pattern: incomplete! It’s broken up! It’s fourth down. A field goal doesn’t help, but the unit comes out anyway. 
Hmm. Interesting. 
block-time published-time 3.28am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 9:38 4th quarter 
On 2nd & goal, Leonard can’t connect Evans in the corner. They have two more shots. 
block-time published-time 3.27am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 10:21 4th quarter 
Leonard is looking for Harrison in the endzone, incomplete but there’s a defensive holding call! That’s an automatic first down. First and goal at the eight!
block-time published-time 3.25am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 10:36 4th quarter 
Greathouse, one more time! This time for five yards down to the 17. 
block-time published-time 3.25am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 11:02 4th quarter 
Leonard has time and hits Greathouse again, this time in the middle of the field! ND are on the OSU 22!
block-time published-time 3.24am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 11:44 4th quarter 
Another vital 3rd down is upon us: 3rd & 12. Leonard is back in the shotgun. He stays in the pocket and hits Evans, short by five yards. And they will go for it. 
block-time published-time 3.23am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 13:04 4th quarter 
Right away, a key 3rd & 9. Leonard in the shotgun, stays in the pocket and launches a ball to Greathouse and he has it! Wow! That’s a great throw and a better catch – a 30-yard gain! 
Now OSU are done for pass interference and suddenly, the ball is on the OSU 38!
block-time published-time 3.21am GMT 
 FUMBLE! Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 14:46 4th quarter  
The call on the field stands! Notre Dame have the ball at their 21!
block-time published-time 3.19am GMT 
 FUMBLE? Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 14:46 4th quarter  
ND blitz, but the reverse beats it beautifully, and Egbuka is off and running! But then Egbuka coughs it up and Notre Dame have it! Was he down? 
Man it’s close!
block-time published-time 3.14am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, end of 3rd quarter 
Howard throws it away on 2nd & 8, but there’s a personal foul on RJ Oben who hits Howard for no reason whatsoever. So instead of setting up a third and long, OSU have a gift first down. And are you kidding me? You can NOT do that!
Here comes the fourth quarter!
block-time published-time 3.12am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 1:21 3rd quarter 
Howard takes it himself on 3rd & 1 for a first down at the OSU 36. ND need a stop to keep this momentum going!
block-time published-time 3.05am GMT 
 How it happened! 
Do we have a ball game? Greathouse thinks so.

 TOUCHDOWN! Buckeyes 31-15 Irish, 3:03 3rd quarter  
Wow! Tremendous catch and run by Greathouse who finds the endzone! It’s a 34-yard TD reception! And then ND convert the two-point play! So all of a sudden, it’s a two possession game with loads of time left. 
Did that wake up the echoes? 
block-time published-time 3.01am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-7 Irish, 3:13 3rd quarter 
Leonard, a little run, but a yard short. So it’s 3rd & 1 from the 38. And here goes Leonard again, this time, running right! it’s their first third down conversion since their opening drive, which tells you everything you need to know. 
block-time published-time 2.59am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-7 Irish, 4:42 3rd quarter 
Leonard is sacked! Styles got their first! It’s an 11-yard loss! Ouch!
it’s 3rd & 19 and Leonard is being chased again, barely getting it away. Evans is interfered with and flags fly! So that’s a first down and ND are across midfield!
block-time published-time 2.57am GMT 
 Buckeyes 31-7 Irish, 6:24 3rd quarter 
ND need a reason to believe. They’re on their own 36 now. Leonard is in the shotgun, runs right and throws a laser to Collins for 10 and a first down. 
block-time published-time 2.52am GMT 
 FIELD GOAL! Buckeyes 31-7 Irish, 7:52 3rd quarter  
Jayden Fielding hits from 46 yards out. 
So it wasn’t a touchdown, that’s progress!

block-time published-time 2.51am GMT 
 Buckeyes 28-7 Irish, 7:58 3rd quarter 
On 3rd & long, Tate is open in the corner of the endzone but Howard’s pass is too long! So here comes the field goal unit.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.55am GMT
block-time published-time 2.49am GMT 
 Buckeyes 28-7 Irish, 8:48 3rd quarter 
Henderson runs it down to the 19.
Then on 2nd and 7, Howard throws, complete, but there’s a flag. Holding on OSU’s Fryar, and that makes it 2nd & 17.

 The Long Goodbye 
Let’s face it, Notre Dame are being destroyed. Can they comeback? Is the Pope Protestant? 
It’s 4th & 1, deep in their own territory and they’re not going for it. They’re kicking. Or they’re faking it!
It’s a pass from the backup QB, Steve Angeli, and it’s incomplete! Oy boy. 
OSU takeover at the ND 33. 
block-time published-time 2.43am GMT 
 The big one 
Here’s Judkins, formerly of Ole Miss, now of OSU, and tearing it up on the big stage.

 — Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) 
block-time published-time 2.39am GMT 
 TOUCHDOWN! Buckeyes 28-7 Irish, 12:46 3rd quarter  
Who else, Judkins, up the gut. 
Too easy. And if you’re Notre Dame, there’s only one thing you can say right now:
“Let us pray”
block-time published-time 2.38am GMT 
 Buckeyes 21-7 Irish, 13:03 3rd quarter 
On 2nd and goal, Howard runs down to the one. Third down. 
block-time published-time 2.37am GMT 
 Buckeyes 21-7 Irish, 14:03 3rd quarter 
OSU start fro their 25, and on second down, Judkins runs and EXPLODES! He runs left, cuts right, and zoom! He’s gone! Or almost gone – he runs out of gas after 70 yards and is taken down at the five!
Right now, that’s your MVP. 
Timeout OSU! Gulp. 
block-time published-time 2.34am GMT 
 And we're back!  
There was no fancy halftime thing for me to make fun of. Instead, we’re back with a key drive for Notre Dame. They just have to make something happen on defense here, now. Then they have to remember how to pass and run. 
No problem!
block-time published-time 2.23am GMT 
 G’day mate! 
Did I mention the Australian punters? Notre Dame has James Rendell, the senior product out of Melbourne. He’s had two kicks tonight averaging 48.5 yards. 
Meanwhile, Nick McClarty, also of Melbourne, hasn’t seen any action yet. Here he is kicking a ball 90 yards, which is really far.

 Stats 
OSU are dominating on total yards, 231 to 93, and in first downs, 15 to six. OSU have thrown to six different receivers, and have handed off to four different, not counting the QB, who has run for 26 yards of his own. He’s also thrown for 144 yards and is nearly perfect, hitting on 14 of 15 passes. Not bad!
Meanwhile, as dynamic as Leonard was on that opening drive, where he carried nine times, the receiving game is basically nonexistent. And less Leonard, so is the rushing game. 
As a matter of fact, after the opening drive, ND have amassed a grand total of 18 yards. 
Ouch!
block-time published-time 2.11am GMT 
 Buckeyes 21-7 Irish, halftime 
The Irish start at the 25. They have two timeouts. 
Here’s a screen to Collins, but no timeout is called and so we head to halftime. 
OSU have assert their dominance after ND’s long first scoring drive. 
ND head coach Marcus Freeman is asked what they have to do to get back in this game by ESPN TV in the US. 
“We just gotta relax man.”
Some points also. 
block-time published-time 2.08am GMT 
 TOUCHDOWN! Buckeyes 21-7 Irish, 0:27 second quarter  
Howard has time, lots of time. Is he going to take himself? It looks like it, but then he fires towards the center of the endzone to an open Judkins! It’s another TD for OSU and that is an absolute killer. 
This could get ugly. 
block-time published-time 2.06am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 0:30 second quarter 
Howard takes it himself down to the ND 12, a gain of 11. Then Henderson runs for six more yards. 
Now, with the ball at the six, OSU call timeout, their second. 
OSU get the ball first in the second half, so it’s vital that ND keep the Buckeyes out of the enedzone. I don’t like their odds. 
block-time published-time 2.04am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 1:15 second quarter 
Smith runs, stops, turns towards his quarterback, makes the catch and runs for a first down. Tough to defend. It’s 15 yards to the ND 23.
Now a pass to Henderson is broken up, incomplete. 
block-time published-time 2.02am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 1:25 second quarter 
Howard in the shotgun – has time – fires to Tate, who slides in the middle of the field and makes the catch! OSU are batting 1000 on third down conversions tonight, 6/6. 
Now Howard is sacked! ND break through and call timeout. It’s 2nd & 13 and ND want to save clock because they think they can stop this OSU train. Let’s see. 
block-time published-time 1.57am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 2:00 second quarter 
Henderson runs up to the ND 45 as we hit the warning. And that sets up yet another important third down coming up after these messages.
block-time published-time 1.56am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 2:14 second quarter 
Howard is hit as he throws, but he finds Innis on a post route for a first down! That’s a killer for Notre Dame who brought pressure and were just a split second too late. And OSU, well, they have lots of options of offense. 
block-time published-time 1.54am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 3:53 second quarter 
Do the Irish have enough gas on defense to stop this OSU multi-faceted machine? Well, right away, it’s 3rd & 7 and an important play coming up right here. Can ND force a punt?
block-time published-time 1.53am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 4:53 second quarter 
The TE is in motion and the snap hits Mitchell Evans! Evans is able to recover but that could have been a deadly turnover deep in their own territory!
So now a punt doesn’t seem that bad. ND kick it away, and OSU start from their 20.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.53am GMT
block-time published-time 1.51am GMT 
 Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 5:37 second quarter 
ND start from their 25. Leonard is back with another keeper. Is he gonna make it through this game? Gain of five. 
Then he’s hit as he throws, incomplete. Big 3rd & 5 right here. The ND defense is not ready to come back yet.

He bounced and bounced and broke into the endzone. 
Ten plays, 76 yards in 6:06. These teams have ripped off huge chunks of clock with these drives. ND needs to give their defense a breather with something sustained here. 
block-time published-time 1.46am GMT 
 TOUCHDOWN! Buckeyes 14-7 Irish, 6:15 second quarter  
Judkins runs it in, and OSU are on top for the first time in this game!
That means ND are behind, and the narrative is that the Irish are not built for comebacks. Can they write a new story?
block-time published-time 1.44am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 6:29 second quarter 
Howard keeps it and has a first down. Gain of about three. Ball on the ND nine. 
block-time published-time 1.43am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 7:10 second quarter 
Jenkins runs and is hit, before squeaking in for a few yards, just a bit deeper into the red zone. 
Now it’s 3rd & 1 as Egbuka has yet another catch! 
block-time published-time 1.40am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 8:20 second quarter 
Egbuka is back again and makes his third catch of the drive, and pays the price, getting crushed by the sideline. I missed who that was for the Irish, but Egbuka didn’t. Ouch!
Ball at the ND 20, timeout OSU. 
block-time published-time 1.38am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 9:07 second quarter 
Howard in the shotgun, looks around and sees that nobody is anyone near him. “Oh, I should run”, he thinks, and so he does! It’s 11 yards, down to the ND32. 
block-time published-time 1.37am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 9:56 second quarter 
Short gain for Egbuka sets up a big 3rd & 5! Can ND hold? 
block-time published-time 1.36am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 10:34 second quarter 
Egbuka, towards the near sideline, finds the edge, turns the corner and has a 14-yard gain. His longest of the season!
Now Tate makes a sideline catch for 15 yards and the machine is in motion. Ball on the ND 48. 
block-time published-time 1.32am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 12:21 second quarter 
A short pass to the tight end Evans isn’t nearly enough, and so the Irish will have to punt from their own 20. 
Good 46-yard punt to the OSU 34. A holding penalty by the Buckeyes pushes them back another 10. So when we come back, State will start at their own 24. 
block-time published-time 1.29am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 13:19 second quarter 
Leonard is in huge trouble, but he dances and escapes, then he fires complete to Beaux. But there’s a holding penalty and that pushes back the Irish even more! After a short run, it’s 3rd & 23!
block-time published-time 1.28am GMT 
 Buckeyes 7-7 Irish, 14:03 second quarter 
Alright, a lot of commercials, but we’re back. Let’s see how Notre Dame respond to the response. From the 25, the Irish start out with an incomplete pass, intended for Collins. 
Now there’s a false start flag – this is different than the first ND possession.

 The big beef Is it weird that there’s a war of words between an 88-year-old former head coach of Notre Dame, Lou Holtz, who was also an assistant at OSU, and the Buckeyes current head coach Ryan Day? Yeah, but it’s also weird that OSU’s payroll for this team is $20m. Anyway, Lou Holtz, who everyone except Notre Dame fans absolutely hated while he was coach at South Bend, once said something about the lack of physicality of the Buckeyes. Then in September of last season, OSU beat Notre Dame, and on the field after the game, Ryan Day brought up Holtz’ comments, rambling on about how he would “like to know where Lou Holz is right now,” of which the answer was, probably at home because he’s almost 90. Now the rift has resurfaced, propelling Holtz to travel to Atlanta to see his Irish try to upset OSU. Perhaps Holtz will be the lucky charm the Irish need? Yes, I wrote that.

 Who needs tickets? 
If it’s you, I hope you have deep pockets. Just getting into the big house in Atlanta will run you $4000 big ones, and that’s for a single upper deck seat. That’s about a dollar for every mile these jet setting college students have covered as they flew around the country playing this tourney. Gosh, I hope they’ve had some time to study! 
Actually, it seems they have, as OSU’s team grade point average is 3.3, which is exceptional considering the lives these student athletes lead. It’s good news for OSU head coach Ryan Day, who gets a cool half million for his team scoring above a 3.0 GPA. 
But I digress: if you want the best seats, you’re looking at close to $12k, which is a lot. If you’ve got the dosh, there’s still time! Or you can just follow along with us for the grand total of zero USD. It’s up to you!

 We are live!  
Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the inaugural 12-team College Football Playoff, national championship game: Notre Dame v Ohio State. Did I say that right? The branding is a bit complicated but that hasn’t stopped millions upon millions of football devouring Americans from watching these games in droves. This tournament, featuring some of the biggest collegiate programs in the nation, has been a complete commercial success, with those invested reaping the ratings and the rewards. It also must be the longest college football season ever, with both of these teams about to suit up for their 16th game, as the final continues to move farther and farther away from college football’s traditional New Year’s day sweetspot.
But never mind all that, we’ve got a ball game to play and for Notre Dame, it just doesn’t get any bigger. One of the most revered and historic football programs in the United States, the Fighting Irish were the very first program to get an “America’s Team” moniker, annoying just about everyone except Notre Dame fans. Even with all the glamor attached to the program, they haven’t won a national title since 1988, and that they’re in the final is something of a surprise, especially when you consider that they lost to Northern Illinois earlier in the season. Once upon a time, losing to a 28 point underdog, one who Notre Dame paid $1.4m just to come and play at South Bend, would have been a death sentence to national title aspirations. With 12 teams, rather than four now being invited to the playoffs, there’s now room for error. So the ensuing 13-game winning streak that these Irish ripped off earned them an invite, and then their stunning defeat of Penn State in the semifinals got them a spot in Atlanta for a shot at all the marbles. 
As so often happens in college sports, with players coming and going more than ever, the head coach is the star. Marcus Freeman is just 39 years old, and one of only 16 black head coaches in the 134 teams known as the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. If he beats Ohio State he will become the first black head coach to win a national title:a significant milestone, and on Martin Luther King Day in the US no less. And if Notre Dame are to win, it’ll be their defense that makes the difference: the Irish have the no2 “D” in the nation.
Ohio State? Well, their defense is arguably even better than Notre Dame’s, which spells trouble for the banged up offensive line for the Irish. It’s one reason why the Buckeyes are favored to win this game by a healthy 8.5 points and to take their first national championship since 2014. Like Notre Dame, OSU also had their regular season pitfalls, suffering a shock defeat to their kryptonite, Michigan on the last regular season weekend of the season. The 21-point upset, at home, led to a players only meeting that galvanized the Buckeyes, who went on to score dominant wins over Oregon and Texas en route to the final in Atlanta. 
The best player on the field tonight will wear red and white. Jeremiah Smith, the vaunted 19-year-old wide receiver punished defenses this season, slicing up the then-no1 ranked Oregon Ducks for nearly 190 yards and two touchdowns in the quarterfinal. Whether Notre Dame can slam the brakes on this future top-five NFL pick will have a lot to do with the ability of the Irish to hang close in this game.

David will be here shortly, here’s something from the AP on the significance of today’s game:
Notre Dame football coach Marcus Freeman felt more comfortable talking about the national championship his players have a chance to win Monday night than the history attached to it if they pull it off. Still, it’s hard to ignore the connections between Freeman’s fate — he is trying to become the first African American coach to capture a college title at the highest level in America’s favorite sport — and all that’s happening in the U.S. on the day of the big game. Monday 20 January is national-title day but also the day the United States celebrates Martin Luther King Jr., and inaugurates Donald Trump to his second term as president. King devoted his life to fighting for inclusion and equality, and today diversity initiatives are increasingly under scrutiny on college campuses. “The timing of Marcus Freeman and Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a powerful symbol that should be viewed with cautious optimism,” said Joseph Cooper, the director of the Institute for Innovative Leadership in Sport at UMass. “And with the incoming administration and their professed commitment to undo DEI policies, it reflects the peril and the long journey we still have to go, beyond just breaking barriers with pioneers.” That Freeman’s potential breakthrough comes more than 40 years after a Black basketball coach first did the same, and that it comes against a backdrop of a mediocre minority hiring record that has shadowed college sports for decades, is a sign of how far those sports still have to go. “Today’s Black coach is the ‘70’s Black quarterback,” Rod Broadway, who coached at historically Black universities Grambling State and North Carolina A&T, said about the once-rare sight of an African American playing the sport’s most important position.
