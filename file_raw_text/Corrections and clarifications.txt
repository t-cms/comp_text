Highlight: Egypt’s Gaza plan | BBC Panorama episode | Wirral’s Pensby High School
Body


 We said an alternative to Donald Trump’s Gaza plan was being prepared by Egypt “in conjunction with the World Bank”. To clarify: the plan is drawing on published reports on reconstruction written by the World Bank (  , 17 February, p25).
 The BBC Panorama episode Can Trump End the War in Ukraine? is scheduled for 3 March, not 24 February as today’s preprinted What’s On section says. Monday’s episode is on the Southport attacks.
 Wirral’s Pensby High School is in the village of Pensby, not in Birkenhead as we said (  , 17 February, p18).
