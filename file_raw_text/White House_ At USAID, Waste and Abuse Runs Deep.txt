The White House issued the following news release on Feb. 3, 2025:
For decades, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been unaccountable to taxpayers as it funnels massive sums of money to the ridiculous - and, in many cases, malicious -- pet projects of entrenched bureaucrats, with next-to-no oversight.
Here are only a few examples of the WASTE and ABUSE:
* $1.5 million to "advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities"
* $70,000 for production of a "DEI musical" in Ireland
* $2.5 million for electric vehicles for Vietnam
* $47,000 for a "transgender opera" in Colombia
* $32,000 for a "transgender comic book" in Peru
* $2 million for sex changes and "LGBT activism" in Guatemala
* $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt
* Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a non-profit linked to designated terrorist organizations -- even AFTER an inspector general launched an investigation
* Millions to EcoHealth Alliance -- which was involved in research at the Wuhan lab
* "Hundreds of thousands of meals that went to al Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria"
* Funding to print "personalized" contraceptives birth control devices in developing countries
* Hundreds of millions of dollars to fund "irrigation canals, farming equipment, and even fertilizer used to support the unprecedented poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan," benefiting the Taliban
The list literally goes on and on -- and it has all been happening for decades.
Under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ENDS NOW.
