The following information was released by the office of Alabama Rep. Terri A. Sewell:
Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) released the following statement:
While I am relieved that our collective calls have forced the Trump Administration to reverse course, the removal of the Tuskegee Airmen from the Air Force curriculum should have never happened in the first place. We should all see the Trump Administrations attacks on DEI for what they really arean attempt to whitewash our history and devalue the contributions of African Americans.
Throughout the next four years, we as Americans will need to remain especially vigilant against attacks on Black history, and as elected officials, we should be prepared to call them out. I hope we can continue to do so in a bipartisan manner.
