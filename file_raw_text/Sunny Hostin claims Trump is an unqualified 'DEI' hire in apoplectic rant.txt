LISTEN: Welcome to MAGAland, our podcast on the latest inside the White House
Sunny Hostin claimed president Donald Trump is a 'DEI' hire as she went on a rant against the Republican's first orders for his second term.
Reacting to Trump's announcement that he would get rid of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, The View co-host used a pun to say Trump 'Didn't Earn It' - and instead obtained the world's highest office through nepotism.
'Donald Trump saying things that this country would be a meritocracy, you're talking about a man who didn't become the president of the United States because of merit,' Hostin said.
She argued Trump did not earn the presidency because he had 'no political experience' before winning the White House the first time. 
'He was given everything that he has,' Sonny continued. 'He is a legacy hire. He is, if anything, a DEI hire, a "didn't earn it" hire, and so, those are just some of the things I was thinking about.'
Hostin then brought up Martin Luther King's legacy and how it differs from Trump's view for the country. 
'The one thing I did think about was the hypocrisy of having a man be inaugurated to be president on the same day as we commemorate MLK, and that same man saying that he was going to get rid of diversity, equity and inclusion,' Hostin said.
'Because Martin Luther King not only wanted racial equality, he wanted economic equality. And that is something people tend to miss.'
Hostin added that 'Black Americans deserve reparations for the injustices they face.'
She then repeated MLK's famous quote - 'it's all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps but to say to a bootless man he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.'
Trump quickly made good on his pledge to sever diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government as he is set to lay off all DEI hires within 24 hours.
The new Trump administration sent a letter to all heads and acting heads of government agencies on Tuesday, informing them all federal employees in DEI roles must be placed on paid leave by 5 pm Wednesday.
All DEI offices in federal agencies are also being shuttered in the move, which comes after Trump signed an anti-DEI executive order in front of a cheering crowd at his inauguration on Monday.
Hostin also tore into rappers Snoop Dogg and Nelly for performing at inaugural events celebrating Trump.
Joy Behar also accused inauguration performer Carrie Underwood of 'normalizing' Trump.
Hostin and co-host Ana Navarro revealed they chose not to tune into Trump's inauguration on Monday. 
Instead, Hostin indulged in some 'Buffalo Wild Wings', she said - while telling the panel she couldn't look past 'the hypocrisy of having a man be inaugurated to be president on this same day as we commemorate MLK.'
In months before, Hostin, like the other panelists had been an outspoken supporter of Biden and then Kamala Harris.
In November, she admitted to giving the latter a 'softball' question during her high-profile spot the month before.
Asking Harris how she'd 'be different' from Joe Biden, the former vice president replied: 'There is not a thing that comes to mind.'
'That was a layup, really,' Hostin said in response.
