DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST AND AUTHOR: So, that's right. Exactly.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": Dana, always great to see you. Now, I am going to check how much change I have in my car cup holder.
LOESCH: Good to see you, Laura.
INGRAHAM: You check. We will get back together and figure out how much money we have a combined. Thanks so much.
That is it for us tonight.
Make sure to follow me on social media. It is America now and forever.
Jesse Watters takes it from here.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think just the spirit of the country, the country has taken a whole new life.,
I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the president be at the game.
WATTERS: Trump, the Eagles, and the art of the comeback.
Hulk Hogan joins PRIMETIME.
BRADLEY COOPER, ACTOR: E-A-G-L-E-S. Eagles.
UNIDENTIFIED BOY: E-A-G-L-E-S. Eagles.
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: A positive net approval rating for Donald Trump, again. Woah.
Woah. Whoa. Whoa.
WATTERS: Commonsense is becoming a little more common.
MARK HALPERIN, THE POLITICAL ANALYST AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF 2WAY: He is just barreling down a deal. The Democrats are nowhere.
ANA NAVARRO, CO-HOST "THE VIEW": I think today, Donald Trump is going to sign an executive order banning Black people from halftime.
WATTERS: How low can they go?
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): This is Code Red.
WATTERS: Plus --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You send my money overseas, then you better go with that money, because you're not doing no good here United States.
WATTERS: The Eagles and Trump have a lot in common, the Birds upset the Patriots, then lost a rigged one to the Chiefs, then last night got revenge.
Trump, the underdog beat Hillary, lost a close controversial one to Biden, then got his payback.
The Eagles won of the first Super Bowl of Trump's first term and the first Super Bowl of his second. But this time for the first time in American history, the president was at the game.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SPORTSCASTER: History already in the building tonight, as President Donald Trump becomes the first sitting US president ever to attend a Super Bowl game live.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Bret Baier sat down with 47 at Mar-a-Lago for the tradition Super Bowl interview that Biden blew off and here is why.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR: Now, you are going to be the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, it is a big day for America, always is, what made you want to do it?
TRUMP: Well, first of all, I am very surprised to hear that. I would have assumed many presidents came, I think just the spirit of the country, the country has taken on a whole new life. I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the president be at the game.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Eight years ago football players were kneeling for the National Anthem, and now they are shaking hands with Donald J. Trump.
The president also met with terrorist attack victims and first responders on the field, the NFL posted a picture of 47 for the first time ever.
And in the suite, here he is with Commissioner Roger Goodell, probably complaining about the new kickoff rule. Ivanka and Eric were also there, and there's the Prince of Monaco.
PRIMETIME cannot understand what the Prince of Monaco is doing in a suite with Trump at the Super Bowl, but we are going to find out, and we put the whole team on it.
This is how Trump thought the game was going to go. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: You're a sports guy. You are a football fan, size up these two teams.
TRUMP: I am a big fan of both teams. They are sort of different. Philadelphia has one of the greatest running backs, Saquon. You know, Saquon had an uncle who was a great fighter, a great fighter and Iran Barkley his name was, say have a great running back. You have a really great quarterback.
The other team, the quarterback really knows how to win. He is a great, a great quarterback.
BAIER: So game prediction?
TRUMP: I hate to do it. I guess you have to say that when a quarterback wins as much as he has won, I have to go with Kansas City. I have to go with Kansas City.
At the same time, Philadelphia has a fantastic -- it is going to be just a great game.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Terrible pick by the president, terrible.
Most of my staff picked the Chiefs, too, they are mostly Giants fans. I cannot forgive them. But I can forgive the president because he was probably campaigning while we saw the Birds tear it up all season.
After the game, he said: "The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got up booed out of the stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(BOOING)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: According to a lip reader, when she heard the boos, she said, "What's going on?"
Well, there were a lot of Eagles fans at the Superdome and a lot of fans with commonsense. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JON BATISTE SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: If he opened over a time capsule in 2017, the last time the Eagles won at the Super Bowl and you saw Taylor Swift getting booed and President Trump was still president and getting cheered, you would be like, what is going on?
Trump is a unifying America against Taylor Swift and the Chiefs, and it is a great thing. We are all sitting around watching the TV, hating the right people. Not hating Taylor, hating the Chiefs.
Everybody was sick of Kansas City winning and getting special treatment, you know what I'm talking about. Referees shouldn't decide football games, just like the media should not decide elections.
At one point in the fourth quarter, it was 40 to six. We were up five touchdowns on a so-called dynasty and we were the underdog.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(CHEERING)
SPORTSCASTER: Eagles favorite pay. Release up. Birds on its knees. Pile drives his way in and touchdown.
SPORTSCASTER: He has done his best to hang in there, but again, not his natural position in the pros.
SPORTSCASTER: Hurts lets it go completely A.J. Brown. He is in. Touchdown.
SPORTSCASTER: Now, the Eagles get it back. We are going to run some plot, or maybe throw the dagger. Hurts going deep. Throwing now, DeVonta Smith. He has got it. Touchdown.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: A complete game, offense, defense, special teams, coaching staff. The win was too big to rig. America is starting to expect the unexpected.
Dynasties aren't inevitable. The history of this country is new generations rising up and throwing out the Old Guard. The league is changing just like the country, and there is nothing to be arrogant about it, Philadelphia worked hard, stuck together and stayed humble.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SPORTSCASTER: Nick, Super Bowl champions, what does the moment mean?
NICK SIRIANNI, PHILADELPHIA EAGLES COACH: Man, God has blessed us very much. He gave us all the talent to be able to get here, so first and foremost, thanks to Him.
JALEN HURTS, PHILADELPHIA EAGLES QUARTERBACK: Thank God. Thank you, Jesus.
SPORTSCASTER: You got back and now, you are a champion. How does that feel?
HURTS: You know, God is good. He is greater than all the highs and the lows, and I think, personally myself, I have just been able to use every experience and learned from it, the good, the bad -- all of it and using these to pursue my own greatness.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The highs and the lows, it is all learning experience, and boy, have we learned a lot from the lows.
We have been told what to do, what to say, what to buy, what to take, what to make. And the whole time they made us feel bad about ourselves.
They attacked our history, our holidays, our heritage, and tried to divide as by race, class, and gender. And then they gave away all we had to sleazy donors in foreign nations.
That ugly period has been vanquished.
Industriousness, optimism, patriotism are not the subject of ridicule, you can even see it in the commercials.
(US SECRET SERVICE ADVERTISEMENT VIDEO CLIP)
VOICE OVER: America was founded on an idea of freedom. America has always stepped forward in time of need, throughout our short but powerful history.
JOHN F. KENNEDY, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Tear down this wall.
VOICE OVER: We have been there for all of it.
VOICE OVER: Our heroes are humble, they have an inner pride to keep this idea alive.
Protectors are born, they are not made.
America's Secret Service protecting the Super Bowl is asking a few more to step forward.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: There was a lot for America to celebrate, football, patriotism and beer.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WATTERS: Good form for a Penn State grad. But that locker room was tame compared to the streets of Center City, Philly.
(FNTV/PHILADELPHIA VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WATTERS: That is not a riot, that's love, and the love is mostly peaceful. Something tells me this will not be the last Super Bowl the Eagles win. Philadelphia is entering a new golden age, and it is fitting considering Philly was the birthplace of our nation.
America is being reborn and we will soon be celebrating our 250th birthday. So celebrate with us, even if some of us are despicable Eagles fans.
We can hate hard when we love hard, too. Do not get the wrong idea, we are passionate and we fight, fight, fight.
Hulk Hogan joins me now. What is up, Hulk?
How are you doing?
HULK HOGAN, FORMER PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER AND ENTERTAINER, REAL AMERICAN BEER CEO: Bow down when I come to your town or get beat down. When I come to your town. You know something? Philadelphia on fire, slams Kansas City, that is why I got the 23 ounce big slam brother, in celebration.
It is a golden era. We got our country back. We got America's team back and we've got America's beer, brother, made here in in America by Americans for Americans. We are on fire, brother.
WATTERS: You have to send one of those beers to Saquon and he will shotgun it in two seconds.
HOGAN: Brother, he is drinking the wrong beer, dude. He has no idea like I said, we are here in America. The owners are here in America.
I was Googling earlier today, man, and AB, they are out of Belgium and that other country, Brazil. The owners aren't even here, man. We are the only American beer now. Real American Beer, brother. We are on fire.
WATTERS: So what was it like when you were watching from the Hulk Hogan Super Bowl Party. You were checking out the Eagles running up the score, the president was at the game. How did it feel?
HOGAN: Brother, when I saw my president salute and I heard that whole arena roar, brother, it was like I had that 700-pound nasty giant over my head. The love that president so much. They know the golden era is here.
And you know something? I did not know who was going to win, tit-for-tat, two great teams, but Philadelphia wanted it more. They were evil. They were aggressive, man. They were riding dirty and they were not taking anything except victory, brother.
WATTERS: What about Taylor Swift? She did not look very happy from the suite?
HOGAN: Well, you know, it kind of reminds me when I got booed in LA a few weeks ago when I was on Netflix, and got 11 billion impressions.
Oh speaking of, Coors spent $8 million to get 12 billion impressions and I got more just by getting it booed, brother.
WATTERS: Sometimes, you have to capitalize on the hate.
What about the halftime show, did you like that?
HOGAN: Bro, I couldn't understand a word that was being said, man. I had my volume turned up, I had a bunch of people yelling and screaming at the house. I really did not know what was going on, man.
I was waiting for Willie Nelson to come out, man, singing "America the Beautiful" or something.
WATTERS: I think next year now that Trump is president, we will get someone like Willie Nelson at halftime, that is what Hulk wants?
HOGAN: Well, that would be great, brother, but the cool thing was, I spoke to the president right before the game, I was riding around the beach on my golf cart and we talked on the phone and he was asking me who I thought was going to win. And I said, brother, I really don't know. There are two great teams.
But he told me, it was going to be a golden era for whoever won, it was going to be a dynasty that nobody could stop.
So Philadelphia, man, good luck with the new dynasty.
WATTERS: Hey man.
HOGAN: Good luck with the new dynasty. You're on a roll.
WATTERS: All right, I love that if we can have a dynasty in Philly, we have never had one in Philadelphia sports history, I would love it, from his to my ears.
HOGAN: Here is to that, brother. I dare them to shotgun one of these 24- ounce big slams, you will really have your Trump pump on, brother.
WATTERS: We are sending a case to Barkley.
HOGAN: Oh man, I wish I was there.
WATTERS: We are sending them to shotgun them through the parade in Philly.
HOGAN: I'll bust you up, really bad, Jesse Watters. I'd bust you up real bad, Jesse Watters.
WATTERS: Let's go.
HOGAN: I'll make you drink the whole thing.
WATTERS: Let's go. See you, Hulk.
HOGAN: I need a nap. I need a nap.
WATTERS: So, what do people think of USAID?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: He went and also out we are spending $2 million for transgender surgeries in Guatemala.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't even get my teeth pulled out and they're spending $20 million --
BELISARIO: Maybe if you guys want to become a woman, they will give you the money.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No way, baby. I've got have my --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: America is wrapping its arms around Trump in a way we have never seen before.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Our CBS poll finds that a majority of Americans, 53 percent approve of the job he's doing. That's a better approval number than he ever reached during his first term in the White House.
ANTHONY SALVANTO, CBS NEWS: He is doing in the eyes of the public what he said he would do in the campaign. There's political value in that.
In fact, 70 percent of people say he's doing what he promised. As people take a look in these first few weeks, there's been a lot of activity. They're getting that general sense of governance, and that's being reflected in these early numbers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: CNN's jaw hit the floor.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Holy smokes. I mean, look at what the difference is between now versus eight years ago during the first Trump term.
All of these respective pollsters have Trump in a better position now than they did eight years ago. The bottom line is Americans are far more likely to say they like what they're seeing now versus what they felt during Trump's first term.
A positive net approval rating for Donald Trump again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Entire first term, just 11 days, just 11 days, Donald Trump had a net positive approval rating. Compare that to the second term, just so far, just so far. Every single day of Trump's second term, so far, he has been on the positive side of the ledger.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: One in five Democrats say Trump is doing a good job, even Democrats hate paper straws.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We are going back to plastic straws. These things don't work. I've had them many times, and on occasion they break, they explode. If something is hot, they don't last very long, like a matter of minutes, sometimes a matter of seconds. It's a ridiculous situation.
So we're going back to plastic straws. I think it's okay, and I don't think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they're eating -- as they're munching their way through the ocean.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Real men should never use straws, so it doesn't affect PRIMETIME, and Trump says, Hamas has a deadline. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: If all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock, I think it's an appropriate time, I would say, cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out.
REPORTER: When you say all hell is going to break loose, are you speaking about retaliation from Israel?
TRUMP: You'll find out, and they'll find out, too. Hamas will find out what I mean.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Voters know what the press doesn't. Trump isn't radical. He's just radically changing our country back to normal. No guys in girls' sports, cutting waste, fraud and abuse, deporting migrants and securing the border -- all common sense moves.
But saboteurs inside the federal government are leaking ICE raid calendars. Pam Bondi says, if you get in the way, you're going down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PAM BONDI, US ATTORNEY GENERAL: If anyone leaks anything, people don't understand that jeopardizes the lives of our great men and women in law enforcement, and if you leaked it, we will find out who you are, and we will come after you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: While Bondi smokes out moles, the president is pinching pennies.
For far too long, the United States has minted pennies, which literally cost us more than two cents. This is so wasteful.
"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time."
Wishing wells and fountains hardest hit.
Trump has options that other presidents never considered. The federal government has thousands of properties in our real estate portfolio that aren't being used, and millions of acres of federal land. Trump could sell this property off for trillions and trim down the debt, but first we need to stop the bleeding.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of money that's going to places where it shouldn't be going where, if I read a list, you'd say, this is ridiculous, and you've read the same lists, and there are many that you haven't even seen. It's crazy. It's a big scam.
Now, there's some good money, and we can do that through any one of a number. I think I'd rather give it to Marco Rubio over at the State Department. Let him take care of the few good ones.
So I don't know if it's kickbacks or what's going on, but the people -- look I ran on this, and the people want me to find it, and I've had a great help with Elon Musk, who's been terrific.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump deputized Elon to hunt down pork fraud and corruption in every dark nook and cranny of the federal government.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Bottom line, you say you trust him.
TRUMP: Trust Elon? Oh, he's not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He's so into it. But I told him do that. Then, I'm going to tell him very soon, like maybe in 24 hours to go check the Department of Education. He's going to find the same thing. Then I'm going to go, go to the military. Let's check the military. We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse.
But I campaigned on this, Bret.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: It's easy finding fraud, you just close your wallet and see who cries the loudest.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JASON CALACANIS, ENTREPRENEUR AND ANGEL INVESTOR: How USAID got to the top of the DOGE list, I think is one of the most interesting aspects of this story.
So if you remember, on January 21st, Trump decided he would do a bunch of executive orders, right? And one of them was to pause foreign aid for 90 days.
Okay. Couple of days later, the White House said, hey, this USAID, the leadership is trying to circumvent the executive order. In other words, they're just going to keep paying people even though the executive order came out. That alerted the DOGE team.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: FEMA spent $59 million in New York to feed and house Biden migrants. Remember how illegals were staying here at swanky hotels and throwing out the free food? Probably would have been better spent on hurricane or wildfire victims.
Instead, Biden funneled the money to Midtown hotel owners. Those hotels booked up full for a whole year, then no one could get a hotel room in the whole city, and other hotels jacked their prices up.
And the government wasted a hundred grand studying, snapping, right, scientists concluded this: "Varying degrees of friction between the fingers alters the elastic performance of a snap." Thank you.
DOGE is ending a $2 million military program that forced soldiers to talk to cartoons, not just any cartoons, DEI cartoons and PRIMETIME is working to get that video for you.
It's over. Commonsense is shining down in America, and Democrats can't take the heat. Not too long ago, they thought shrinking the government was a great idea.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK CUBAN, ENTREPRENEUR: With changes in technology, the ability to evolve to government as a service. As a libertarian, I think we can reduce employment in government by at least a third, reduce the overhead of the administration by that much or more, so that we can offer more to services for our citizens.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: But now that Trump is making cuts, Democrats are defending waste, fraud and abuse. The deeper they dig, the worse they look. DOGE pulled back the curtain and now there's no going back.
While most of the country makes an honest living, pays a lot of taxes, government vampires are bleeding us dry, making six figures from corrupt government subsidies to fluff up their resumes.
The jig is up, and the country is rejoicing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They say, hey, you know, if you want to see what he's doing with the government, just look at what he did with Twitter when he took it over. But yes, he cut a bunch of staff that was unnecessary, and he cut unnecessary cost down.
If we apply that to the government, that means more taxpayers savings and more money for us to get our government out of debt.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Health and Human Services has canceled 62 contracts worth $182 million. I would like all of the income taxes that I've paid since I've been alive and working to be returned to me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Clay Travis is the founder of outkick.com.
All right, Clay, who's just probably nursing a wicked hangover from the whole weekend at the Super Bowl going to all the parties.
Clay, why do you think Trump's numbers are so high?
CLAY TRAVIS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: First, congratulations to your Eagles, Jesse, and let me just talk about how popular Trump is for a minute. Eagle fans cheered Trump. They booed Santa Claus back in the day, Jesse, for people who don't remember, they lost it in the old bet on Santa Claus, and now they love Trump. Everybody was cheering for him.
They're booing Taylor Swift. I thought it was an incredible Super Bowl. By the way, data just came out. Most watched Super Bowl of all time, according to Fox Sports PR --
WATTERS: Wow.
TRAVIS: -- in the last 20 minutes.
But look, I think you hit on it, Jesse. The overall commonsense of Trump in that clip that we just ran through -- paper straws. My kids, when they found out that Trump was banning paper straws, were cheering like crazy. When he decided -- I mean, I'm not even kidding about this, they thought it was amazing.
Men and women's sports, it's an eighty-twenty, ninety-ten issue and Democrats have overwhelmingly found themselves in the minority position there.
You just played Mark Cuban, who was opposed to fraud being found in the government. Democrats are now, Jesse, they wanted to hire 88,000 IRS agents to go through, I bet your tax return. I'm currently being audited when you take over Rush Limbaugh's radio show. I'm told that's what happens to you.
WATTERS: Biden audited you?
TRAVIS: You know what the government sent me? Yes. Biden audited me. And you know what, Jesse? You know, I'm a humble man, but I paid seven figures in taxes. Biden told me I owed an additional $39.75.
WATTERS: No way.
TRAVIS: I swear to you. I had to stroke a check. I swear to you, Jesse, $39.75. I had to stroke a check to the government. They've audited me every year since I took over for Rush. And you know what they told me, Buck Sexton and I, then Buck is being audited, too. They said, as soon as you take over this show, Democrats are going to audit you every year.
But think about that.
WATTERS: Oh my God.
TRAVIS: It's not just -- it's not just me, 88,000, they don't trust the individuals to be honest, but they trust the government to be honest. They've got it backwards. They're blowing it, and Trump's killing it.
WATTERS: Yes, well, you cut a check for more than 39 bucks to the IRS. I'm sure you paid your accountant a lot more than that to go through all of those returns.
TRAVIS: Tens of thousands dollars to go to the return.
WATTERS: Your accountant is a good man. He is a good man, all right. He's a good man.
TRAVIS: Thank you, Jesse.
WATTERS: And thanks for congratulating me on the Eagles. I didn't play last night, but I will take full credit. Thank you so much.
Democrats just launched a MAGA snitch line. Right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: It's only week four of the Golden Age, and Trump is blowing everyone's minds.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HALPERIN: I'm paid to not be baffled or speechless. That's been my job. I am baffled and somewhat speechless. The Democrats are nowhere on the field. The press is nowhere on the field.
I have never seen anything like, not just the activity, but the inability of his opponents to forget stopping him. They're there barely, with a few exceptions, even slowing him down.
What matters is the real lives of real people, and the impact this is going to have on not just American government and the world, but American history.
And I think on that score, based on the -- you know, the early returns here after a couple weeks, this turns the Reagan Revolution into a joke.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: We're only two minutes into the first quarter, and Democrats are already tearing up the playbook.
Chuck Schumer sent a letter to his Senate colleagues with a four-point plan to stop Trump -- investigations, litigation, legislation, and party messaging -- riveting stuff.
He is also sending a bat signal to the bureaucrats, launching a Deep State snitch line for anyone who wants to dime on Trump.
They're so upset with Trump's plan to shut down parts of the federal government, they're threatening to shut the whole thing down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS: Are you prepared to shut down the government to join Democratic colleagues who want to stand in the way of keeping the government open?
SEN. ANDY KIM (D-NJ): You have to look at what the Trump administration is doing right now. They are simply trying to -- they are simply trying to --
WELKER: Is that a yes?
KIM: -- they are simply trying to dismantle the government.
So, yes, look, if we have to take steps to be able to hold them accountable, use the leverage that we have to force it. I cannot support efforts that will continue this lawlessness that we're seeing when it comes to this administration's actions.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The left can't cope. Lines for psychiatrists are out the door. A Georgetown psychology professor said she's seen an uptick in patients, particularly Democrats, expressing a sense of burnout, guilt, and despair at losing an old way of life.
Liz Warren is declaring DEF CON One.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): If you have a bank account or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is Code Red. I am ringing the alarm bell.
Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
If they succeed, CEOs and Wall Street will once again be free to trick, trap, and cheat you,
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And they're tearing their hair out over DOGE.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): I mean, what we are witnessing is a constitutional crisis. We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution in honoring Congress' role in the creation of the agencies in their role in deciding where money is allocated.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The ladies of "The View" say Trump is going to make Kid Rock through the next three Super Bowl halftime shows. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NAVARRO: I think today Donald Trump is going to sign an executive order banning Black people from halftime, and all the racists who somehow get in, man, were they hopping mad.
So if the racists are mad, I am happy as a plan.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: While the rest of the press is calling for an insurrection --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KARA SWISHER, "PIVOT" PODCAST: A lot of them are like, what do we do? They're literally asking me, what do we do to stop him? I was like, I just don't -- I was like, you don't. You actually don't have the means to do so, because these poor people are in these agencies, and when these idiots come in, these children, these arrogant little (bleep) come in and say, we're going to call the federal marshals, or the president has ordered you to step aside, they kind of have to, you know.
You have to be resistant and be walked out by security and then security doesn't know which one to listen to.
SCOTT GALLOWAY, "PIVOT" PODCAST: I'd like to see all, whatever it is, 48 or 49 US senators and any Republicans who want to join, I'd like to see a couple hundred members of Congress go to the (bleep) building where this is and demand to go in and physically stop this and let them arrest you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats aren't lining up to be arrested just yet, but as Chuck Schumer says, they are quite aroused.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Hey everybody.
You know, I realized a rally a day keeps the fascists away.
REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Elon Musk, where are you? Bring your ass over here. We're not afraid of you.
He's a thief. He's a gangster.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Adam Carolla is the host of "The Adam Carolla Show." I did not expect to see Mad Maxine Waters threatening to scrap with Musk on the streets of DC.
ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN AND AUTHOR "EVERYTHING REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING: Oh, that was Maxine Waters. I thought it was Aunt Esther from "Sanford and Son."
WATTERS: Maxine Waters, no relation, Adam.
Have you heard about the snitch line? They're going to have a hotline now where you can blow the whistle on government corruption? That's Chuck Schumer's idea.
CAROLLA: I thought they already tried that in Minnesota with the governor for COVID. But okay, they love a snitch line, which is funny. They like ratting out your neighbors and now, well, really, anyone you disagree with or they disagree with.
The thing about the Democrats is the Democrats is that Democrats should just put ahead some proposals that American people like, instead of an open border and high taxes and expensive gasoline, start talking about stuff people like, because their only plan is attacking other people who are doing things that America likes.
So it's basically, if you open a restaurant, your plan would be to make the best food ever and make a lot of money. Their plan would be to rat you out to the health inspector, get you closed down, and then keep serving up subpar slop.

Whatever he said, they went the other way with But what they didn't realize is most of America agreed with what he said. So they screwed themselves on the last election, and they're not slowing down.
WATTERS: If Trump said that halftime show at the Super Bowl was garbage, then Democrats would say was the best halftime show of all time.
