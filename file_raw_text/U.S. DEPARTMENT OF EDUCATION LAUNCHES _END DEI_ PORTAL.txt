The following information was released by the U.S. Department of Education:
Today, the U.S. Department of Education launched EndDEI.Ed.Gov, a public portal for parents, students, teachers, and the broader community to submit reports of discrimination based on race or sex in publicly-funded K-12 schools.
The secure portal allows parents to provide an email address, the name of the student's school or school district, and details of the concerning practices. The Department of Education will use submissions as a guide to identify potential areas for investigation.
"For years, parents have been begging schools to focus on teaching their kids practical skills like reading, writing, and math, instead of pushing critical theory, rogue sex education and divisive ideologiesbut their concerns have been brushed off, mocked, or shut down entirely," said Tiffany Justice, Co-Founder of Moms for Liberty. "Parents, now is the time that you share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools. This webpage demonstrates that President Trump's Department of Education is putting power back in the hands of parents."
