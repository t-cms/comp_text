Hello! It’s Rebecca Morin, senior national news reporter at USA TODAY. I’m going to be crushed when this week’s beautiful spring-like weather is gone by next week.
House GOP advances plan for Trump's legislative agenda
House Republicans passed the first major test of their conference. In a dramatic last-minute turnaround of a few holdouts, the House voted 217-215 Tuesday evening to advance the GOP plan for President Donald Trump's legislative agenda. The plan seeks to pass several of Trump’s priorities for border, energy and taxes. Trump endorsed the House’s plan to roll his campaign promises into one "big, beautiful bill."
You asked, On Politics answers: Is Medicaid being eliminated?
One reader, Bruce Clay, said he has seen reports that Medicaid is being eliminated: “What are the ‘facts’ around that? Is it true or hype?”
Many of the reports are in regards to the blueprint that the House passed on Tuesday, which would set out a total amount of money Congress could spend to implement Trump’s priorities and the total amount it must cut. The budget blueprint instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut at least $880 billion in costs through 2034. Trump has ruled out cuts to Medicare and Social Security, so some experts say that means that cuts could happen to Medicaid. However, negotiations on where cuts will happen are still playing out. Democrats and many Republicans, including Trump, oppose cuts to Medicaid.

White House says it, not news outlets, will control press access to Trump
Breaking with tradition, the White House announced Tuesday that it would decide which news outlets have access to President Donald Trump. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House Correspondents' Association would no longer be allowed to decide which outlets are included in the White House press pool. The White House press pool includes reporters from wire services like The Associated Press, Reuters, and Bloomberg News, a camera crew from the five major television networks, a radio correspondent and a rotating group of print outlets, including USA TODAY. The press pool documents what’s happening in tight spaces or events that have limited space, like aboard Air Force One or in the Oval Office.
