Basketball 
The men's and women's basketball teams both took home wins against Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday in the Paulson Center, holding steady as the No.1-ranked teams in the UAA. 
The men's team led by 10 points by halftime, and, after scoring the first six points in the second half, widened that lead to 17. Strong performances from graduate student Brock Susko, who came out of the game with 24 points, senior Zay Freeney, sophomore Hampton Sanders and graduate student Jack Stone, who all scored double digits, landed the Violets a 77-58 win against the Bears. 
The women's team also defeated WashU with a final score of 77-58, identical to the men's team. Graduate student Natalie Bruns scored a career-high nine assists and had a game-high 24 points. 
The Violets traveled to Atlanta, GA on Friday to face off against Emory University. Despite two lead changes during the game, the men's team pulled off a close win against the Eagles with a final score of 82-79, redeeming themselves from their previous loss against Emory in January. 
The women's team beat Emory for the second time this season with a 67-40 win, extending their undefeated streak to 52 straight games. Bruns continued to shine this week with 23 points scored, assisted by graduate student Jamie Behar with 10 points and junior Caroline Peper with nine. The Violets' defense was as strong as ever, forcing 21 turnovers throughout the game. 
Fencing
The Violets participated in the George Kolombatovich Historical Meet at Columbia University on Wednesday, fencing three schools each and both ending the meet with 2-1 records.
Both teams dominated against Vassar College and Sacred Heart University, with the women's team achieving a standout victory of 24-3 over Vassar College. 
The men's team narrowly lost against Columbia with a score of 15-12, while the women's team lost 22-5 to the Lions. 
Sophomore Adam Wong on the men's team and sophomore Aurora Aschettino from the women's team both led the meet with 6-0 scores in foil, while first-year Azniv Basralian put up a strong performance for the women's team in epee, and first-years Ansh Ghayalod and Vincent Hong from the men's team held strong records in saber.
The Violets will compete in Brooklyn on Sunday, Feb. 23 at the Long Island University Shark Showdown hosted by Long Island University. 
Swimming & Diving
The men's and women's swimming teams traveled to Atlanta, GA from Feb. 12-15 to compete in the four-day-long UAA championships against seven other collegiate teams.
On Wednesday, the first day of the competition, the women's 800-yard freestyle relay team placed first in the event, breaking the team and UAA record in the process. The men's team performed just as well, placing first and taking home the UAA title for the first time in program history. 
On Thursday, first-year Maksym Nechydyuk and senior Jaeden-Hans Yburan set new personal bests in the 200-yard individual medley and both placed in the top 3 of the event.
On Saturday, the women's team placed first in the 200-yard butterfly, and junior Kaley McIntyre set D-III records in both the preliminary and final rounds of the 100-yard freestyle. 
The women's team fell short of first place, trailing just 21 points behind Emory, but were awarded Coaching Staff of the Year honors. McIntyre, who took home seven first-place finishes throughout the meet, was named UAA Swimmer of the Year. The men's team also finished in second behind Emory, but Nechydyuk was named UAA Rookie of the Year and the team finished with several first-place victories. Both teams earned the highest UAA finishes in program history.
The Violets will return home on Friday, Feb. 21 for the NYU Winter Invitational. 
Track & Field
The Violets spent all weekend breaking records with the men's and women's track and field teams split between the Boston University David Hemery Valentine Invitational, the Tufts Stampede Open in Medford, MA and the NYU D-III Invitational at home. 
From the men's team, sophomore Julian Aske smashed a personal best for the fourth meet in a row and set a new program record of 1:49.52 in the men's 800m at the Valentine Invitational. Aske now holds the 10th-fastest time in D-III history. Senior Ryan Tobin also set a program record in the 5K run with a time of 14:06.77. 
The women's team also had its fair share of personal bests in Boston. First-years Katharine Frank and Gianna Dawson both set personal records in the 800m, with Dawson breaking her own program record with a time of 2:13.66. Senior Katherine Cheng and first-year Eliza Dickie achieved personal bests in the mile, along with junior Janie Cooper and first-year Stella Kuttner in the 3000m. 
At the Violets' D-III Invitational, junior Travis Perry and sophomore Lincoln Tutor hit their respective personal bests in the 400m, and junior Dasha Jackson set a new personal best in the 60m hurdles.
Also in New York, first-year Lindsay Guthrie added another win to the Violets' books in the 3000m. Several other members of the men's and women's teams competed in the long jump, 60m hurdles, triple jump and the 400m run.
The Violets will be back in action in March for the UAA Indoor Championships, hosted by the University of Chicago on Mar. 1.
Volleyball
The undefeated men's volleyball team went up against Stevens Institute of Technology in the Paulson Center on Wednesday. With a final score of 3-1, the Violets beat the Ducks for the first time since 2020.  
Sophomore Devyn Nguyen proved why he's ranked fourth in the nation in assists with 45 in the match against Stevens. Sophomore Emerson Evans was also a standout with 19 kills. 
The Violets continued their winning streak with a championship trophy at the Morgan Classic Championship in Springfield, MA on Friday and Saturday, where senior Lucas Osiecki was named MVP of the tournament. 
The team will be back in Paulson on Wednesday, Feb. 19 to face St. Joseph's University Long Island. 
Wrestling
The wrestling team took home their second consecutive UAA title on Saturday, Feb. 15 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH.
NYU had individual wins in seven of the ten weight classes, including junior Harrison Gordon's first-ever UAA title. Gordon, along with junior Vincenzo Napolitana, senior Cooper Pontelandolfo, graduate student Hassan Khan, junior Nicky Bell, graduate student Trent Furman and sophomore Bennett Sonneborn were named to the All-UAA Team.
The Violets were also awarded UAA Coaching Staff of the Year honors and first-year Tyler Kadish was named Rookie of the Year.
