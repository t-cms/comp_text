The following information was released by Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt:
Senator Schmitt tonight applauded President Trump for his flurry of executive orders that tackle issues important to Americans, such as securing our border, unleashing domestic energy production, and taking on the administrative state:
"President Trump promised that he would take immediate action on issues that matter to the American people, and he's followed through on that promise. From securing our border to unleashing our domestic energy production to ridding our federal government of divisive DEI programs, President Trump is putting into action what the American people wanted. This in turn will lower prices for working families, make America safe again, and restore American values that are desperately needed."
