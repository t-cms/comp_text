The following information was released by the office of the Vermont Attorney General:
Last week, Attorney General Clark joined a coalition of 15 attorneys general in issuing guidance to help businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations understand the viability and importance ofdiversity, equity, inclusion and accessibilitypolicies and practices in creating and maintaining legally compliant and thriving workplaces.
The guidance comes in response to concerns from employers following a Trump Administration Executive Order that purportedly targets "illegal DEI and DEIA policies." Importantly, the coalition's guidance informs companies that efforts to seek and support diverse, equitable, inclusive and accessible workplaces are not illegal, and the federal government cannot prohibit these efforts in the private sector through an Executive Order.
A copy of the guidance is available here.
