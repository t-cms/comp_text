2025 Federal Outlook for Higher Education
The 119th Congress has convened, bringing both challenges and opportunities for higher education.
A leaked list of House budget and tax proposals includes a number of alarming policy ideas. In response, NACUBO President and CEO Kara Freeman wrote to Capitol Hill, outlining priorities and urging lawmakers to protect tax-exempt status and to ensure college affordability.
"We strongly urge Congress to focus on support for policies that uplift students and support institutions and our nation's economy," Freeman wrote.
Other recent legislative proposals target colleges and universities with increased taxes, raising significant concerns.
Legislative and Regulatory Threats
Lawmakers are considering a range of tax and spending measures that could have serious financial consequences for colleges and universities, including--
* Expanding the excise tax on endowments
* Eliminating tax-exempt bond financing
* Repealing charitable contribution deductions
* Taxing scholarship and fellowship income
* Cutting student loan benefits and education tax credits
These proposals are part of broader budget reconciliation efforts, where lawmakers are seeking offsets to help fund the extension of tax cuts and other federal priorities. If enacted, they would increase financial burdens on students and institutions, limit support for research, and weaken higher education's ability to serve its missions.
Federal Funding Freeze and Its Reversal
Initially, a White House order freezing federal funds created widespread concern among higher education institutions, threatening disruptions to student aid programs and research funding from agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. However, following criticism from education leaders and advocacy groups--including NACUBO--the White House rescinded the freeze. Nevertheless, concerns remain and there are many questions still unanswered.
New Regulatory Considerations
In addition to legislative challenges, recent regulatory developments require attention from business officers:
* Financial Responsibility: The Department of Education has updated its Financial Responsibility FAQ, clarifying reporting requirements and potential audit implications. Business officers should review these updates to ensure compliance.
* Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and Affirmative Action: President Donald Trump's executive order targeting DEI and affirmative action programs may affect institutions, particularly those with large endowments. Business officers should assess potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
* Fee Disclosures: The Federal Trade Commission's final rule on fee disclosures, while narrowed in scope, may still require adjustments to institutional practices. Business officers should review the rule and update procedures accordingly.
* Financial Value Transparency and Gainful Employment (FVT/GE) Reporting: The Department of Education has reopened the FVT/GE reporting portal, providing another opportunity for institutions to submit required data. Business officers should ensure timely and accurate reporting.
* Misrepresentation: Recent guidance from the Department of Education emphasizes the applicability of misrepresentation rules to third-party servicers. Business officers should monitor and oversee these relationships to ensure compliance, despite uncertainty around the guidance's future.
NACUBO's Response
NACUBO has been proactive in addressing these legislative and regulatory challenges. We urge the Trump administration to reconsider harmful policies and we are working alongside campus lobbyists, higher education associations, and advocacy groups to oppose adverse tax proposals. NACUBO remains committed to advocating for policies that uphold institutional financial health and student success.
What Business Officers Should Do
In this uncertain environment, it is more important than ever for higher education business officers to stay informed and engaged. We recommend you--
1. Stay informed
2. Advocate for higher education
3. Plan for financial uncertainty
4. Collaborate to strengthen messaging
The 2025 legislative and regulatory outlook presents significant challenges for higher education. However, by staying informed, engaged, and proactive, business officers can help their institutions navigate these challenges and continue to fulfill their missions.
