LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": That's my question. How many articles in "The Daily Mail" right now?
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Right, now, my eye is on Baldoni.
INGRAHAM: All right, Raymond, thank you. Great to see you. You look very Grammys, you're all black tonight.
All right, that's it for us tonight. Follow me on social media, Instagram, and the rest. Remember --
Jesse Watters and the gang, they take it from here.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me tell you, in all cases, they all want to make deals, they've been abusers. I'd go right now, reciprocal tariffs on everybody.
WATTERS: The Tariff Sheriff puts the world on notice.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is a black woman at this podium, and I deserve your attention.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I need your support.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are sick and tired of this --
WATTERS: The Democrats didn't get it together.
STEPHEN A. SMITH, HOST, "THE STEPHEN A. SMITH SHOW": The Democratic Party looked so pathetic after this election. I might entertain running.
REP. BRIAN MAST (R-FL): $50,000.00 to do a transgender opera in Columbia; $47,000.00 to do a trans comic book in Peru; $20,000.00 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador.
WATTERS: Sorry, guys, the party is over.
TRUMP: They turned out to be radical left lunatics.
WATTERS: Plus --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Welcome to the Gulf of (bleep) America. Oh, wait, I can't say that.
WATTERS: You can't say he didn't warn you, mass deportations, caravans making U-turns, migrants sleeping at Gitmo instead of four star hotels. DEI destroyed, bureaucracy slashed, FBI purges, and foreign aid cuts, more on that. California's reservoirs are even filling up and wind farms off the Jersey Shore canceled.
Countries are learning a very important word in the English language, "respect." Colombia did a 180 after tariff threats and started taking back their bad hombres; and after flipping Biden the bird, Venezuela is taking their migrants back, too.
All it took was a trip by Ric Grenell who flew home with six American hostages. What did we give up? Nothing.
Up next, Panama.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Secretary of State Rubio is in Panama right now, and we're talking about the Panama Canal. What they've done is terrible. They violated the agreement. They're not allowed to violate the agreement.
China is running the Panama Canal. That was not given to China, that was given to Panama foolishly, but they violated the agreement, and we're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: After Rubio's first visit, Panama ripped up the Canal contract with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Trump also started a trade war with Mexico and Canada, a 25 percent tariff on all imports. Democrats pretended it was economic Armageddon. Chuck Schumer said, what about my cerveza?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): What's that going to mean? Higher prices. Higher prices for New Yorkers, higher prices for Americans. It's going to affect almost everything.
Let's just take Super Bowl Sunday, okay. It's going to affect beer, okay, most of it Corona here comes from Mexico. It's going to affect your guac, because what is guacamole made of? Avocados. Both from Mexico.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Before Chuck could put down the avocados, the Mexican president buckled and agreed to send 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the southern border to stop migrants and fentanyl.
In exchange, Trump paused tariffs on Mexico for a month if they behave.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: So the call with Mexico went very well in the sense that they're very strong now on the border.
REPORTER: Did you blink this morning?
TRUMP: There was no blinking. No, she's a wonderful woman, but she did agree to 10,000 soldiers on the border. I would say that's a lot. Would you say that's pretty good? Ten thousand soldiers on the border? And the 10,000 soldiers are going to keep illegal aliens out, and they're going to keep them out, seriously out, and otherwise they're going to have a big penalty. Mexico is going to be penalized.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Yes, Trump got Mexicans help to secure the border and slow down mass migration and drug overdoses, but for a few hours there, it looked like we might have had to pay 10 cents more for guac.
China is back dooring cars and dumping cheap steel through Mexico and the cartels are funneling fentanyl and illegals into the United States. If countries are going to wage economic and drug warfare on us, why have we been waving the white flag?
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth went down to the southern border today and said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETE HEGSETH, US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SECRETARY: Border security is national security. Guys and gals of my generation have spent decades in foreign countries, guarding other people's borders. It's about time we secure our own border.
Mission accomplished means 100 percent operational control of the border. Right now, that means a surge of manpower.
To the cartels, all options are on the table.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump's DEA Chief is vowing to build a multinational army of good to fight evil. So Mexico is not off the hook just yet, and neither is Canada. They were next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Canada has been very abusive of the United States for many years. They don't allow our banks. Did you know that? Canada does not allow banks to go in. If you think about it, that's pretty amazing. If we have a US bank, they don't allow them to go in. Canada has been very tough on oil, on energy. They don't allow our farm products in, essentially.
Don't allow a lot of things in and we allow everything to come in. It's been a one way street. We subsidize Canada by the tune of about $200 billion a year. And for what? What do we get out of it? We don't get anything out of it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: American banks in Canada are barely allowed to lend money, and they can't even accept deposits less than six figures.
Canada dumps cheap lumber into the US, and it erupts major duties on American dairy farmers. Plus, they're delinquent on NORAD and NATO, so it's time to pay up.
Canada tried to hold out and just ended up begging for mercy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER CANDIDATE: Americans have to understand how hurt and frankly, how furious Canadians are. Our sovereignty is being challenged. And so yes, regular Canadians across the country are coming up with ways to stand for Canada, to fight for Canada, to defend Canada, but mostly to say to our American neighbors, guys, just cut it out. Just stop it. This is a terrible idea.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Well, the first mistake was begging for mercy on CNN, not Fox. Everybody knows Trump doesn't watch that channel. We're even seeing trade war propaganda on Canadian SNL.
("THIS HOUR HAS 22 MINUTES" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the hell are you doing?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's Heinz ketchup.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's American. Buy French's. It's Canadian. We're in a trade war, you traitor.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mrs. Butterworth? You were going to buy American maple syrup.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, that costs way more.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So does freedom.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Canada needs us more than we need them. Over 75 percent of Canadian exports come here. They can't win a trade war with us. They know it, Trump knows it, and there's only one way out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Look, well, I'd like to see Canada become our 51st state. We give them protection, military protection. We don't need them to build our cars. I'd rather see Detroit or South Carolina or any one of our -- Tennessee -- any one of our states build the cars. They could do it very easily. We don't need them for the cars. We don't need them for lumber.
We don't need them for anything. We don't need them for energy. We have more energy than they do. We don't need them for energy.
So I say, why are we doing this? Why do we -- why are we willing to lose between a hundred billion and $200 billion a year? We don't need them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: But before I even got on the set for "The Five," Governor Trudeau crawled to the table: "I just had a good call with President Trump. Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan, reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border."
Canada caved, and in exchange, Trump paused tariffs for 30 days. There was no inflation, there was no recession, the market closed pretty much flat. But we've been told tariffs don't work, and that Trump's trade wars are reckless.
Well, so far, every country that's been threatened bent the knee, and we haven't conceded a thing. And if tariffs are eventually enacted, American consumers have a choice. We don't have to pay for Corona, we can buy Bud, just not Bud Light.
Tariffs encourage Americans to buy American and it encourages multinationals, if they don't want to get hit with a tariff, to have their products made in America. That boosts American jobs and wages. Europe's next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We have massive deficits with the European Union, massive like $350 billion if you can believe it. They don't take our farm product, they don't take our cars. They don't take almost anything, but we take their cars. We have millions of cars coming in, BMW and Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen and just so many different cars, and we don't do anything about that.
How many Chevrolets or Fords do you see in the middle of Munich? And the answer is none, because they don't take any cars. They don't take anything.
So the European has abused the United States for years, and they can't do that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The Europeans have a 10 percent tariff on American cars. You know what the US tariffs European cars? Two-and-a-half percent. America should never accept bad trade terms, especially when we pay to defend Europe.
You can already see how the European trade war is going to end. They'll drop their duties on American car imports, pay their NATO dues, and German car plants are going to shift to South Carolina or Tennessee.
And Greenland's destiny is also a part of this negotiation. We see you up there. There's a new sheriff in town, the Tariff Sheriff.
You combine economic power with gun boat diplomacy, and you could put together a new world order based on America First.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Every single one of those countries is dying to make a deal. You know why? Because they're ripping us off really badly. And the United States is tired of -- we are just being ripped off, and that's why we have $36 trillion in debt.
We have it for a reason, because we make bad deals with everybody, and we don't allow that anymore.
In the end, you're going to see that either very, very substantial tariffs are going to be paid by them, or they're going to make some kind of a deal.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: With Trump, there's always a deal to be made. He just announced from the Oval that Ukraine will have to sign over rare earth minerals in exchange for our generous support.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We're telling Ukraine they have very valuable rare earth, we want what we put up to go in terms of a guarantee. We want a guarantee.
We want -- we're handing them money hand over fist. We're giving them equipment. European is not keeping up with us. They should equalize.
Look, we have an ocean in between, they don't. So we're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Lithium, uranium, titanium -- they are just some of the rare earth minerals that Ukraine has that are critical to the future of the American economy and our National Security. We can't let China dominate this space.
A powerful economic message is being sent, and on Saturday, the world heard a powerful military won. Trump ordered airstrikes against ISIS leaders in Somalia. American commanders are being unshackled by the timid rules of engagement placed on them by Biden. Our enemies will be taken out early and quickly, preventing big wars by winning small battles.
The Rupture you're experiencing, the whiplash you're witnessing is a commander-in-chief with a vision on a mission and a young cavalry in the Cabinet to execute action fast.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We have great people coming in. I think, I'd like to say the best ever recruited for government. I think we have the finest people ever recruited for government.
You're starting to see that because we've done more in two weeks than Biden has done in five years, six years. They could be here between him and Obama, you add it up, okay, we've done more in two weeks than they've done in 12 years.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Joe Biden liked to say, "never bet against the United States," but other countries were and they were winning by betting against Biden. And now that the Big Guy is gone and the Tariff Sheriff is in charge, there's law and order here at home and abroad.
Host of "Making Money," Charles Payne joins me now.
All right, Charles, we were told tariffs don't work. Trade wars are lose- lose. What happened?
CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, we were told wrong. And that was the craziest part about all of this, is you just go and check history.
For instance, tariffs mean automatic inflation. Look at Smoot Hawley. Well, go, look at it. It was the greatest deflationary period of our time. In fact, that was the issue.
Well, tariffs can hurt the economy. Look at the Roaring 20s. We had the Emergency Tariff Act in 1921, then we have the Fordney-McCumber Act in 1922 that went all the way through 1930. The market up 500 percent.
Go back to McKinley, the same thing. It's so ironic.
Tariffs actually work and they work very well. And believe me, when they talk about these extra 30 days, you wonder, okay, well, what's that about? You've got to believe that President Trump, and he keeps dropping hints, would love to go for the whole shebang.
Yes, Canada, 51st state. We have Greenland and we keep these tariffs on because we want to bring businesses back. We want to bring manufacturing back.
We want to really, really secure long term prosperity. A few years ago, when all the experts said China was going to pass America, what was the main reason for that? China plays the long game.
We've got to play the long game. Yes, people out there one hour into the tariffs already declaring us losers, right?
So we've got to play a longer game. And the longer game is actually using our mic while we have it.
WATTERS: So the next 30 days, obviously, he's not sitting back. There's wicked negotiation going on right now between Mexicans and the United States and Canada. What are those negotiations going to be about? And eventually, you're right, Trump is going to have to throw the tariffs up just in order to enforce a deadline.
PAYNE: The economic part of this, the trade and balance of all of this, is what I think President Trump really wants to get at.
Now there's another component to that, and that's these American companies that have chosen to set up shop right over the border in Mexico. They complain about, well, look at the supply chain. A car goes to America, then Canada, then Mexico, then America. Why? Well, it doesn't have to.
And what's really nuts about it is, if you take a few points off of these major corporations, off their bottom lines, and the stock went down today, six months from now, it will be higher, six years from now, it will a hundred percent higher.
I mean, the market adjusts. Okay, the stock doesn't trade at a PE ratio of 26, it trades at a PE ratio 25. It adjusts.
All of this near-term fear mongering, really, we have to get past this.
WATTERS: I mean, but if your silk ties are made in Canada and they come get hit with a 25 percent tariff, Charles, are you going to buy American and sacrifice your good style?
PAYNE: So here's the thing, I've got the same tailor for 28 years, the same Pietro Mucci, okay. He comes down to the house, him and his son, they fit me up. They just came this past weekend for a second fitting of wait till you see these new suits. People will have to adjust their eyes, but that's a different story.
So I'm hoping -- I'm hoping I can keep my relationship with Pietro. We'll see what happens. You don't want to lose any friends and customers. We've got to keep Charles looking fly.
PAYNE: We've got breaking news. Breaking news, Jesse. Ecuador just slapped tariffs on Mexico. I'm not kidding. So everyone is saying we want free and fair trade. Ecuador.
WATTERS: All right, it'll be fun to watch.
Charles, good to see you.
PAYNE: Yes.
WATTERS: Democrats hold a dance off to pick their next leader.
Plus Johnny --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHNNY BELISARIO, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, FOX NEWS MEDIA: How do you think the Mexicans are going to take this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They'll be fine. I'm friends with some of them.
BELISARIO: What's their names?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have Jose --
BELISARIO: Cuervo?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: America is sprinting into the Golden Age, and Democrats don't know what to do. One strategist said, "Trump is eating us for lunch, and for the most part, we're letting him."
It's not the Democrats don't want to resist, they just don't know how. They're stuck in the past. They think they can name call their way to winning.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): The problem is that Americans thought that it was okay to take a full-fledged criminal and make him the president of the United States, and then they want to act aghast when he does criminal things.
Let me tell you, we have a thug in charge of the United States, and if we don't wake up, we may not have a United States, because right now, he has only been successful in being a divider in chief.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: After 10 years of hoaxes and smears, Trump is bulletproof. So Democrats are arguing whether to talk about eggs or Hitler. They're fighting each other. They're not fighting for you.
One Democrat said this: "Twenty big cities, Aspen and Martha's Vineyard, that's what's left of the Democratic Party, and I'm not exactly sure those 20 big cities are getting the best version of the Democratic Party."
The Democratic Party is in such a weak position that folks with no political experience are like, why not me?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: I doubt I'll ever run. It's not me. I live a pretty good life, and I don't want to ruin it by getting involved in politics.
But I've got to tell you all something. The Democratic Party looks so pathetic after this election, I might entertain running.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Carville says, go for it, Steven A. You couldn't do worse than Kamala.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: We ran a presidential election. If we were playing a Super Bowl, we started our seventh string quarterback. That's what happened. Okay, let's -- you can't -- you can't address a problem unless you're honest about a problem.
Now, if you were to put the staggering talent that exists in today's Democratic Party, let me -- you heard what I said, the staggering talent that exists in today's Democratic Party and people would have seen that, they are going to go, I didn't know we had people like that can actually complete a sentence, okay, that actually know how to frame a message that actually have a sense of accomplishment of doing something.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Well, this weekend, we got to see some of the Democrats' staggering talent. They held auditions to run the DNC. Here was the first question.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JONATHAN CAPEHART, JOURNALIST: So I'm going to have a show of hands. How many of you believe that racism and misogyny played a role in Vice President Harris's defeat?
Okay? So that's good. You all pass.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Okay, they all made it to round two. Next question.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will you pledge to appoint more than one transgender person to an at large seat, and will you commit to making sure those appointments reflect the gender and ethnic diversity of the transgender community?
JEN PSAKI, MSNBC HOST: Since Carol wanted to ask this of everybody, would everybody here commit to that? Or is there anyone who wouldn't raise your hand if you would commit to what she just asked? Okay.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: After calling the country sexist and racist and promising to bring back DEI, they got down to policy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is my desire to be the next DNC chair and I just want to give you all a little bit of something that's been on my heart here over the last couple of days.
You fight on, you fight on. You fight on. You fight on, when your government is doing you wrong, you fight on, oh, you fight on.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Then they started dancing.
Trump has the YMCA, Democrats have the Cupid Shuffle.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WATTERS: The talent portion ended, and one Democrat actually had a good idea. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON, DNC CHAIRMAN CANDIDATE: If I'm your chair, I'm going to be very honest. And if we're going to be very honest, we have to look in the mirror, and we have to stop some of our hypocrisy. And one of our issues of hypocrisy is about money. We have to recognize that people see us as hypocrites.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The one Democrat with a good idea didn't get the gig. Another Democrat took the stage and basically said, Oh no, you didn't.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello, Democrats, Hey, I am speaking, and I would love your attention. There is a Black woman at this podium, and I deserve your attention, like the 11 people who went before me. Yes, I am speaking.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats were ready to elect their new leader, but they had to stop the count. Gender violation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMIE HARRISON, OUTGOING DNC CHAIRMAN: Our rules specify that when we have a gender nonbinary candidate or officer, the nonbinary individual is counted as neither male nor female, and the remaining six offices must be gender balanced.
With the results of the previous four elections, our elected officers are currently two male and two female. In order to be gender balanced, we must -- we must elect one male, one female and one person of any gender.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: We don't know what any of that means, but at the end of the day, they picked a straight White guy to run the party.
His name is Ken Martin, and he loves DEI.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SYMONE SANDERS, MSNBC HOST: What factors should go into deciding what the 2028 calendar should be? And is diversity important to you?
KEN MARTIN, INCOMING DNC CHAIRMAN: Absolutely it is, and I would just say that's what we have to start with, is making sure whatever calendar we put forward respects the traditions and diversity of our Democratic Party.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats have had three months since the election to get it together, but they haven't learned a thing.
A Republican won the popular vote for the first time in decades. The country is demanding less inflation, DEI and migrants and more commonsense, and all the Democrats are doing is dancing on their own graves.
Sage Steele is the host of "The Sage Steele Show," so singing and dancing is not usually what you think is a qualification for running the Democrat National Committee. Why was that so front and center?
SAGE STEELE, HOST, "THE SAGE STEELE PODCAST": Jesse, this might be -- I don't know how many times I've been on with you, a dozen? The best monologue/intro you've ever done. I'm sitting here. I can't see a thing. I can hear it.
I'm in awe. By the way. Excuse me, I am a Black woman with a microphone on. Oh, wait, but I'm biracial. I'm only half Black. Am I allowed to speak? Do I qualify?
I cannot with these people.
You talk about completely tone deaf. We had one that began to speak about looking in the mirror. Look in the mirror. How about read the room. Stop being tone deaf.
You lost because of more so what you did and did not do than the Republicans. I think quite often, these people aren't used to losing, whether it's 2020 because they made sure that they did not lose in 2020; certainly 2016, they've always run better campaigns than Republicans until now.
They got -- they were resting on their laurels, and they are in shock, but to not look at the facts, starting with the big map of voters from the election three months ago, and how red that map is.
How about the Black vote? Seventy-six - seventy-eight percent, the highest number of Black voters to vote for a Republican in over 50 years. Stop denying it. Take the loss and Republicans, please, like go for the jugular here, because there was a definitive message sent by these voters, you've got to go for the jugular.
We have the best bench ever thanks to Donald Trump. I'm in -- I am shocked, but not disappointed that the Democrats are handling this like the petty children that they are.
I'm in awe, and I'm sorry I can't dance here. Maybe that's my White mom's fault. I know.
WATTERS: That would make two of us here.
Sage Steele, they're making it easy. We ran the tape. We had producers watching this thing. They didn't talk about fighting inflation, they didn't talk about securing the border. They didn't talk about any of the actual issues that affect the country.
A lot of this was about making sure they had enough nonbinary people in the right roles.
STEELE: It's shocking to me. Again, maybe this is simply because they aren't used to it. They don't know how to handle defeat.
Even though they got a lot of messaging, all the research, all the money that they spent during the election and messaging saying, hey, this is where people are leaning, and maybe you shouldn't have Oprah be your person, or Obama go in and scold Black men for not voting for Kamala, or maybe not having Cardi B twerking out there.
Read the room, Democrats. Look at what the voters have said and react accordingly. But hey, as far as I'm concerned, keep acting this way, because I think what Trump is doing, so many people, even on the left are acknowledging, yes, this is what has to happen. Look at the confirmations. Look at how many Democrats are saying, okay, we're going to help confirm Burgum and Kristi Noem.
So, there's a major shift, Jesse, and this is fun to watch.
WATTERS: It is fun and now that you're in awe of my script writing, you're welcome back any time, five days a week.
Thank you, Sage.
STEELE: I love you.
WATTERS: I love you, too.
Elon Musk breaks into Washington's bank. Wait until you hear what he found.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: The Trump doctrine isn't just for foreign countries like Colombia and Canada. It's being used here at home. There was a Friday night mini massacre at the FBI where Trump fired dozens of prosecutors and FBI agents. But permanent Washington isn't just rolling over.
New York's top FBI agent sent an e-mail telling his staff to dig in after Trump started cleaning house. We'll see what that looks like. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and DOGE are attacking bloat like an angry honey badger, exposing one of the country's biggest soft power slush funds, USAID.
USAID's $45 billion -- billion dollar -- budget is getting gutted. The organization used to play an important role, but it got hijacked by looney bureaucrats.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: They went totally crazy what they were doing, and the money they were giving to people that shouldn't be getting it, and to agencies and others that shouldn't be getting it, it was a shame.
I love the concept, but they turned out to be radical left lunatics. The concept of it is good, but it's all about the people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Secretary of State Marco Rubio says USAID is done spending like drunken sailors.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARCO RUBIO, US SECRETARY OF STATE: One of the most common complaints you will get if you go to embassies around the world from State Department officials and ambassadors and the like, is USAID is not only not cooperative, they undermine the work that we're doing in that country.
They're completely uncooperative. They won't tell you what the programs are. They refuse to answer questions. They try to push through payments. Even after the executive order, they were still trying to push money through the system.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: USAID probably has good reason for wanting to keep the auditors out. It's been an intelligence cut out for decades.
In the 70s, the CIA funneled millions to Laotian paramilitaries through USAID. We used it to pay off Pakistan during the war on terror, and they hid Bin Laden from us the whole time.
And just a few years ago, they tried to foment a Cuban uprising with fake social media. Elon Musk says, "It became apparent that it's not an apple with a worm in it, what we have is just a ball of worms. to basically get rid of the whole thing. It's beyond repair. We are shutting it down."
Wait until you hear about all this crazy pet project stuff they had. Ready?
$2.5 million to promote DEI in Serbia.
A transgender opera in Colombia.
A DEI musical in Ireland.
And a trans comic book in Peru.
Oh and $40 million to fund gain-of-function in Wuhan.
Now that DOGE is getting rid of crooked pet projects, Democrats are melting down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): We are witnessing a constitutional crisis. We talked about Trump wanting to be a dictator on day one, and here we are.
REP. JIM MCGOVERN (D-MA): I want to apologize. I want to say I'm sorry that you have to put up with this offensive (bleep) coming out of this White House.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): If you want to know how an unelected shadow government operates, look no further than DOGE.
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): We are living a nightmare created by Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and we need to wake up.
SEN. RON WIDEN (D-OR): They are seizing the tools you need for a coup.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats couldn't muster any emotion for funding hurricane victims. They spent years on the sidelines while Americans suffered under Bidenomics, but you take one trans Peruvian comic book and they lose their mind.
"Outnumbered" co-host and former White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany is here.
Kayleigh, a lot has happened in the last two weeks, but Trump froze foreign aid and the Democrats went crazy. Why is that?
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST "OUTNUMBERED": Yes, Senator Chris Murphy called this a constitutional crisis. I mean, really?
WATTERS: Yes.
MCENANY: Not giving Serbia the DEI funding? Jamie Raskin was apoplectic. I mean, I read just a week ago that Democrats were going to save their rage for moments that matter, and this is what they pick as the moment that matters?
I don't know if they learned any sort of lesson over the last four years. Threat to democracy, all of these apoplectic things did not work.
And USAID, if you want to make that your marquee talking point going into the midterm elections, by all means, because I'm sure the factory worker in Ohio is going to resonate with that one.
WATTERS: There's two reasons it looks like. One, it looks like it was a CIA cutout. They were using it to bribe people, influence elections, pay off people, dah-dah-dah-dah or run operations. But also, it made the Democrats feel compassionate.
When they can get out and they say, you know, we funded millions and millions of dollars for this little thing here and this little thing there. It just makes them feel good. We've taken their compassion checkbook away.
MCENANY: We're taking that away, and that's a big part of it. I think you hit on that nicely.
But Jesse, another big component of this is the draining of the swamp entirely. I mean, they depend off the swamp. They are swamp creatures on the bottom, swamp dwellers draining off of this federal bureaucracy.
You know, I was reading about the fear that these federal workers are having that Chris Murphy and others like them, I'm sure, depend on, guys like Peter Strzok, who, thank God, are out of the FBI.
Remember him? We all smell like smelly Walmart shoppers, apparently. Those were his text messages. He's out.
But at the bottom of this is what you have an NBC article saying that they're fearful, this federal bureaucracy, at the very bottom of the article is a federal worker saying we're going to stay in spite. We could stay here until retirement, if we so choose. We could stay here the next 30 years. Trump can't do anything about it. That was the quote that they gave to NBC.
They are terrified of the reshaping of government because that lasts beyond Donald Trump, that lasts for potentially decades to come. So it's USAID, yes, but it's much bigger than that.
WATTERS: Yes. This went to their nonprofits, their little charitable organizations, their institutes, their institutions, all the people that give them stuff, that book their travel, that do their trips, that pay for this and that, and they take them to -- that's all gone.
Their little pay for play behind-the-scenes apparatus is getting dried up, and usually it has to do with self-preservation. That's when Democrats get so exercised.
Kayleigh, great to see you. Sorry we won't be able to read that DEI comic book in Peru together.
MCENANY: Thanks, Jesse.
I know.
WATTERS: Johnny goes to the Gulf of America.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: One of President Trump's first executive actions was renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, but has it really set in? How are people down there taking the change?
We sent Johnny to Fort Myers Beach, Florida to take it in.

TRUMP: I didn't know that. They are just telling me now for the first time.
BELISARIO: Ladies, how's the Gulf of America?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The water's wetter, the sun's hotter, the men are hotter.
BELISARIO: Well, that's because I'm here.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That helps, for sure.
("THE FIVE" VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WATTERS: Johnny, that was really inappropriate.
BELISARIO: Why President Trump rename this?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It sounds sexier.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wants to make a point.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mexicans send our people over here, so we must send the United States over there.
BELISARIO: How do you think the Mexicans are going to feel?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who cares?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They'll be fine. I'm friends with some of them.
BELISARIO: What's their names?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have Jose.
BELISARIO: Cuervo?

BELISARIO: Well, we still have New Mexico.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I mean --
BELISARIO: For now? Are you a little upset you lost the name?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why would you say that? I don't give a damn. I'm not Mexican.
BELISARIO: Oh, my bad.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all right. I appreciate it.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
SCHUMER: Yikes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The babes over here, bikinis. I mean, this is the prime spot to be.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
SCHUMER: People are aroused. I haven't seen people so aroused in a very, very long time.
BELISARIO: What else should President Trump rename?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: McChicken to a McNugget Donald Trump.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He should rename Nevada because, like, nobody knows how to pronounce it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The White House to the Black House.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I almost said that, but I decided I shouldn't say it.
BELISARIO: Should we take the Panama Canal?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sure.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you mean the Panama Canal? Nice.
BELISARIO: The Panama Canal.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
BELISARIO: The Canal.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We funded it, really. I mean, we -- we should really have it. We got screwed over on that.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's doing too much (bleep). Thank (bleep) anyways.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WARREN: who wants to move to a place where the air smells bad?
BELISARIO: What about Canada? They're resistant pretty hard.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whatever move he makes, I think we just need to trust.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I like their accent, oh, eh.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's cold up there, you know what I mean? Who wants to be in the cold? We, in Florida, bro. (Bleep) Canada.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fifty states is good.
BELISARIO: You don't want Justin?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Timberlake?
BELISARIO: Trudeau. What does that mean?
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
TRUMP: Great governor. A great governor.
BELISARIO: Why do you want Greenland?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Greenland. I don't know anything about Greenland.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Greenland, man, that's where the money at. Green you feel me? Money. Where the green at.
BELISARIO: Greenland is full of ice.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ice, bro. We sell the ice, bro. Ice for money, man.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
TRUMP: We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.
BELISARIO: How's President Trump been doing?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great. He's been in office for what like 15, 16, 17, days.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is a high. I voted for him.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Save TikTok.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He makes us richer.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Melania looks fantastic. She was strutting her stuff. Oh, and you can't forget about the little suitcase boy, you know, suitcase boy?
BELISARIO: Barron.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We love Barron.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
BARRON TRUMP, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S SON: I like -- I like my suitcase.
BELISARIO: What have the Democrats been up to?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sitting on their couch, probably.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They did nothing in four years.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sleeping.
(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
BELISARIO: Jesse sent me to the Gulf of America, but now I need to go back to New York tomorrow.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That actually sucks for you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jesse Watters, you know, come down to Fort Myers, come see me.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Welcome to the Gulf of (bleep) America. Oh, wait, I can't say that, can I?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: More PRIMETIME straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Watters family went to the Museum of Natural History on Saturday. There's Gigi staring at a triceratops, stegosaurus, God knows what. We learned a lot about dinosaurs, in and out in an hour, minimal tears only at the very end, clean escape. Big success for the Watters family.
Let's do some texts.
Ed from Shelton, Connecticut: Trump's tariffs are so successful, I might try putting one of my wife's Amazon account.
Dave from Allen Park, Michigan: Someone tells Schumer the tariffs are transitory.
Todd from Sheboygan, Wisconsin: Jesse, give Chuck a break. He needs some cervezas to wash down that raw burger.
Oh man, that man does not know how to grill.
Jay from Dixfield, Maine: Dude, I came up with Tariff Sheriff, you stole it.
I did? It's not that creative.
Valerie from Bend, Oregon: Hang on, why is Justin Trudeau still importing that racist Aunt Jemima syrup?
I have to say Canadian maple syrup is much better than Auntie Jemima.
Claudia from Montreal: As a Canadian, I agree with the Tariff Sheriff. Please make us your 51st state.
If you're Canadian and you want to become a US citizen and you want to become a star on the flag, text us.
Eric from Sparks, Nevada: Tariffs will be imposed on Jesse Watters' budget unless he finally reads my text message.
Trade war avoided.
Chris from Boise, Idaho: I want to see Hulk Hogan do a cannonball into the Gulf of America. That would be icing on the cake.
Hulk's watching. Be careful of that splash.
I'm Watters, this is my world.
