                     Donald Trump ordered federal employees to remove their pronounces from the email signatures as he continues his widespread purge of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the government. 
Federal employees were sent memos ordering them to remove their pronouns from official government communications by the end of the week.
'Pronouns and any other information not permitted in the policy must be removed from CDC/ATSDR employee signatures by 5.p.m. ET on Friday,' read one message from the Center for Disease Control's Chief Information Officer Jason Bonander, according to a copy of the memo obtained by ABC News.
The memos cited Trump's executive orders signed after taking office as responsible for the change.
One federal government employee from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) griped to ABC News about Trump's detailed restrictions.
'In my decade-plus years at CDC I've never been told what I can and can't put in my email signature,' the employee said.
The use of pronouns in work emails has expanded in recent years to signal a company's commitment to inclusion of employees who identified as a different gender than the one they were born with. 
The Democratic party sought to be as inclusive as possible, allowing potential employees for the Kamala Harris presidential campaign to select from nine different genders on employment applications. 
Republicans, however, made a concerted effort to combat the use of specific pronouns in the workplace. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) even put up a sign outside her office on Capitol Hill defying the inclusive government effort in regard to gender.
Trump also moved to root out 'gender inclusive' practices after taking office. 
His executive orders required government agencies to remove DEI language from all communications and publications.
A memo from the Office of Personnel and Management acting director Charles Ezell ordered agencies to close all DEI offices and place employees on administrative leave.
'These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination,' the memo read.
Trump signed an executive order on his first day as president ordering all DEI and DEIA and environmental justice offices and positions be terminated within 60 days.
The president's executive order seeks to unwind the efforts by the Biden administration to advance 'racial equity' throughout the federal government.
'The Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military,' Trump's order read.
He described the programs as a sign of 'immense public waste' and 'shameful discrimination.'
'Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great,' the order read.
Trump blamed the recent plane crash with a Black Hawk helicopter on DEI policies put into place by the federal government by former President Joe Biden.
He vowed to continue rooting the programs out of the federal government, expressing his desire to only hire the best and the brightest people into the positions regardless of their race and gender.
'The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department and we need the best and brightest, whether it's in our air traffic control or whether it's in our generals or whether it's throughout government,' he said.
