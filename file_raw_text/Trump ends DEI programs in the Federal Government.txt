In an array of sweeping executive orders, President Donald Trump reversed over a dozen Biden-era policies that ensured diversity, equity and inclusion (commonly abbreviated as DEI) in his, and any future, administration.
"The Director of the Office of Management and Budget ... shall coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and 'diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility' ... in the Federal Government ," stated Executive Order 14167 that was signed by the returning President. The statement from the White House issued on January 20 refers to DEI as a collection of "unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices". 
One executive order reversed by President Trump, EO 11246 , was enacted in 1965 and amended over the years. Before its reversal, the order, originally implemented by Lyndon B. Johnson, protected individuals "from discrimination on the basis of their race, color, religion, sex, ... or national origin". In 2014, "sexual orientation [and] gender identity" were also added to the act as protected groups. In addition, it ensured "affirmative action" to prevent workplace discrimination.

Affirmative action, as defined by the US Department of Labor, is "the obligation on the part of the contractor to take action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, [regardless of] their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran ".
"ensure that applicants and employees of federal contractors have equal opportunity for recruitment, selection, advancement, and every other term and privilege associated with employment
Though President Trump described DEI as "wasteful" and "discriminatory", others have different opinions. The American Psychological Association states that the DEI framework "promotes the fair treatment and full participation of all people, especially populations that have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination" . Equality and equity are frequently confused with one another, equity aims to result in equality by giving everybody equal opportunity to achieve. Examples of this include scholarships for people 
DEI is often attributed solely to race or disability, but these are far from the only demographics who benefit from the framework. Other groups that can be included under the umbrella term include (but are not limited to) veterans , single parents  and seniors , the three of which are frequently underrepresented in education and employment across the country. 
Rhode Island College has several programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, such as the Unity Center  and the Office of DEI . A staff member from The Anchor reached out to both for comments.
The Unity Center, while not able to give a complete statement at this time, responded that one is in the works.
"I can assure you that staff, faculty, and administrators are having conversations about the future of DEI at RIC," answered Danii de la Rosa, assistant director of the Unity Center . "[We] will be releasing a statement soon. Any statement released by the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion will be separate from the Unity Center's." 
The Office of DEI answered with a statement from RIC President, Jack R. Warner :
"The fundamental mission of Rhode Island College is to make quality higher education accessible and affordable for any and all who wish to pursue it," stated President Warner. "That is why we remain committed to creating a safe and supportive environment on campus where everyone can feel a sense of purpose, belonging, and opportunity, regardless of race, ethnicity, country of origin, language, religion, age, gender or sexual identity, political viewpoint, educational background, or socioeconomic circumstances.
"Some are feeling afraid or uncertain of what this might mean for them, their colleagues, or their loved ones. President Warner has convened an ad hoc committee to thoroughly examine any new federal policies; to determine what, if any, practical impacts they will have on our work and our campus community members; and to respond in a way that ensures we're serving our students to the best of our ability while still complying with the law. 
"Rhode Island College is committed to protecting all of our students, faculty and staff and making our campus a place where everyone feels safe and welcome to come as they are and fulfill their potential."
