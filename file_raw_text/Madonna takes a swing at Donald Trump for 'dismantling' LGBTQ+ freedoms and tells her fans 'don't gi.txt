Read More: Donald Trump to ban transgender troops and DEI military programs
                     Madonna has blasted Donald Trump for 'dismantling' LGBTQ+ freedoms as the president plans to ban transgender troops and diversity, equity and inclusion military programs in his latest flurry of executive orders. 
The Queen of Pop voiced her concerns in an X post Tuesday. 
'It's so sad to watch our new Government slowly dismantling all the Freedoms we have been fighting for and WON over the years', the 66-year-old singer wrote, adding a rainbow flag and a broken heart emoji to her tweet. 
'Don't give up the fight', the pop icon added. 
The 'Like a Virgin' singer has long been an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and was even sued in Russia in 2012 for her support of gay rights. 
Her remarks come as Trump made a series of executive orders targeting transgender, non-binary and intersex US citizens. 
This week, Trump signed a new executive order titled 'Prioritising Military Excellence and Readiness' that will eliminate DEI from the armed forces and prohibit transgender people from serving. 
A new order will go even further and lay out standards regarding pronoun usage and gender identity.
The move is part of a wider crackdown on 'gender insanity' in the federal government, according to officials.
He also signed an order saying that the federal government will only recognize two sexes - male and female.
Trump has already taken several actions seeking to outlaw DEI initiatives.
The practices require that certain groups - like minorities, women and those with disabilities - be prioritized for job placement.
Republicans say they want a return to 'common sense' that prioritizes 'merit-based hiring.'
It comes a week after the new Trump administration sent a letter to all heads and acting heads of government agencies informing them all federal employees in DEI roles must be placed on paid leave. 
This executive order is a continuation of Trump's purge of government workers hired under what he claims are 'discriminatory' practices. 
Trump has also banned federal funding for transgender sex-changes for minors. 
He signed the executive order yesterday after condemning the practice of sex transition surgeries for minors, noting that 'countless' children regretted the surgeries that 'mutilated' and trapped them into fighting a 'losing war with their own bodies'. 
'it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,' the executive order from Trump read. 
The president is acting quickly to roll back efforts by the Biden administration to extend federal benefits for children
