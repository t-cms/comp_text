Air traffic controller 'left work early' before deadly crash

A supervisor allowed an air traffic controller at Ronald Reagan National Airport to leave early, hours before the passenger plane collided with an Army helicopter in midair, according to reports.
Both aircraft plunged into the icy Potomac River shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday and all 64 passengers on the American Airlines regional jet, along with three soldiers on the Black Hawk helicopter, are presumed dead.
A single controller was left to handle the air traffic of planes and helicopters flying over the airspace when two people would typically be monitoring both flight paths, sources told NBC.
The Federal Aviation Authority reportedly confirmed in a preliminary safety report of the crash that one controller was doing the job of two, according to the New York Times. Airplane and helicopter traffic is normally handled by two separate controllers until 9:30 p.m., but a supervisor allegedly merged the two jobs before the allotted changeover time, a source told the newspaper.

What might've caused the D.C. plane crash

Kelly Rissman
The fatal midair collision on Wednesday evening between an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet moments away from landing at Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport was a shocking and extremely rare occurrence, according to experts who believes human error is the likeliest explanation behind the tragedy that claimed dozens of lives.
In audio of the tower at Reagan communicating with the helicopter crew, a controller can be heard asking if they have the airplane in visual range, telling the chopper to pass behind the jet. Moments later, the two smacked into one another, killing all 64 people on the plane, which was flying in from Wichita, Kansas, and the three service members aboard the Black Hawk. On Thursday, officials with the National Transportation Safety Board told reporters they were not yet certain of the tragedy's root cause.
Philip Greenspun, an MIT professor and former Delta pilot who flew the same Canadair Regional Jet involved, touched down at the same airport countless times. To his mind, the crash was most likely the result of human error stemming from a confluence of factors.

Authorities are going through the gruesome process of identifying the victims found so far, as families of people on board are forced to wait to have their worst fears confirmed. 
Among those who have been identified are the personnel flying the two aircraft. The American Airlines crew included Captain Jonathan Campos, 34, and First Officer Sam Lilley, 28. The Blackhawk crew included instructor pilot Andrew Eaves. His female co-pilot has yet to be named.

Federal workers urged to find 'higher productivity' jobs

FAA employees received an email late Thursday  - just one day after the fatal collision - from the Office of Personnel Management encouraging them to seek 'higher productivity' jobs in the private sector.
"We encourage you to find a job in the private sector as soon as you would like to do so," read the email, which was reviewed by The New York Times. "The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector."
Federal employees at other agencies also received the email, the outlet reported. But the message likely hit the FAA particularly hard, as the agency is already under scrutiny for its staffing during the incident.
An air traffic controller was given the job of two people after one worker clocked off early on Wednesday evening, the night of the crash.
The mass email was sent days after the same White House office sent out another email blast, which offered a nearly eight-month buyout to employees if they choose to quit by February 6.

Both black boxes from the American Airlines plane have been recovered - but what are they?
15:30

Tim Hepher
The name is a misnomer; they are not actually black but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the quest for answers when planes crash.
Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. Earliest devices recorded limited data on wire or foil. Later devices switched to magnetic tape. Modern ones use computer chips inside hard casings.
There are two recorders: a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) for pilot voices or cockpit sounds, and a separate Flight Data Recorder (FDR). Some devices combine both functions.
They are mandatory on civil flights and the aim is to preserve clues from cockpit sounds and data to help prevent future accidents, but not to determine wrongdoing or liability.
In broad terms, investigators say the FDR helps them analyze what happened and the CVR can - though not always - start to explain why. But experts caution that no two probes are the same and virtually all accidents involve multiple factors.
The disappearance in 2014 of Malaysian Airlines MH370 triggered debate about whether data should be streamed instead.

Donald Trump responded sarcastically to questions about whether he would be visiting the site of the deadly crash over the Potomac River in Washington D.C., asking reporters at the White House: "You want me to go swimming?"
The president said on Thursday he would be meeting with some of the families of victims of the tragedy, which occurred at Ronald Reagan Airport Wednesday night. All 67 people involved in the crash are presumed dead, authorities said previously.
When asked about his plans to visit the crash site, he replied: "I have a plan to visit, not the site. Because you tell me, what's the site? The water? You want me to go swimming?"
Mike Bedigan has the story.

Robert Prewitt was described as "very devoted to his three girls," by his family.
The 44-year-old was an ironworker from Lusby, Maryland. His company sent him to Witchita on January 9. 
He liked his job but "didn't like being away from home so much," his aunt, Susan Prewitt Naylor, told The Independent.
"We are a big mess. This is not our first loss," she said.
Prewitt's daughter, Aubrie, said her dad had been "hilarious" and "knew just what to say when I was having a hard day to make me laugh."
"I miss you today, tomorrow, and forever," she wrote on Facebook.
