NBC parent Comcast is now the subject of a federal investigation - one focused on the telecommunication firm's DEI initiatives and practices.
                     FCC Chairman Brendan Carr sent a letter to CEO Brian Roberts revealing the agency's investigation Tuesday, stating its Enforcement Bureau had been directed to investigate at the behest of the Trump administration.
'I expect that this investigation into Comcast and its NBCUniversal operations will aid the commission's broader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates,' Carr wrote in the correspondence.
                     The recently appointed chairman further noted how Comcast's website promote DEI initiatives when it comes to hiring, training, and programming.
Trump has signed a series of executive orders over the past several weeks that have caused federal agencies to dial down DEI programs, laying off thousands in the process.
Earlier this week, PBS announced it was closing down a unit entirely dedicated to DEI initiatives in the wake of a $20 billion lawsuit filed by the president.
CBS's parent company Paramount Global was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which surrounds an October 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris and several sections of it that did not make it to air.
Trump has already secured a $15 million defamation settlement from ABC News in December, after which he vowed to sue other outlets due to the press being, in his words, 'very corrupt'. 
Comcast's executives recently held a post-earning conference call to discuss its upcoming Cable spinoff SpinCo, which will include both MSNBC and CNBC.
The new company, headed by Mark Lazarus, will include networks like USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and the Golf Channel. Parting ways with some NBCUniversal assets, Comcast will retain NBC and NBC News.
The streaming service Peacock will also go to Comcast, while being run by the chair of NBCUniversal Entertainment and Studios, Donna Langley, and Matt Strauss, chair of NBCUniversal's media group.
Previously chairman of NBCUniversal's TV and streaming divisions, Lazarus was named the boss of SpinCo in November. 
The company is now made up of mostly NBCU cable channels alongside Comcast's networks, 
A few weeks before, Lazarus reportedly told high-level staffers how he wants more Republican voices on the channel and is mulling running opinion programming during the day, The Ankler reported.
The changes may come with pay cuts for longtime opinion hosts like Joy Reid and Stephanie Ruhle, the outlet reported.
Weeks earlier, Lazarus was said to have slashed Rachel Maddow's pay by some $5 million after she agreed to stay with the network for another five years. She has since been brought back to a five-day-a-week schedule, amid waning ratings. 
Comcast is targeting to complete the spin-off in approximately one year, with SpinCo operating as an independent business amid a transition services agreement with NBCUniversal that execs implemented. 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are serving as financial advisors to Comcast during the transition, which began in November a few weeks after the election.
The plans to spin off NBCUniversal's cable networks into a separate, publicly traded company comes as a greater pivot to streaming, which will now be the focus of NBC Universal.
The tax-free spinoff won't include the NBC or Telemundo, after NBCUniversal chief Mike Cavanagh in October states the company would rather consider partnerships in streaming rather than a merger with firms like Paramount.
'When you look at our assets, talented management team and balance sheet strength, we are able to set these businesses up for future growth,' said Roberts upon announcing the intent to start the separate, publicly traded company. 
'With significant financial resources from day one, SpinCo will be ideally positioned for success and highly attractive to investors, content creators, distributors and potential partners.'
Roberts is the Chairman and CEO of Comcast, which offers cable television, wireless phone and broadband Internet services.
It owns NBC Universal, which includes the NBC broadcast network, NBC Sports, Universal Pictures and the streaming service Peacock.
The NBC- and Telemundo-owned local TV stations staying with NBC are regulated by the FCC, and possess an FCC-issued license to broadcast publicly.
Comcast's wireless phone and cable TV services are also regulated by the FCC, due to their status as 'public utilities.'
