After taking the oath of office his second time, President Donald Trump was sworn in on Monday as the 47th President of the United States and with the words the "Golden Age of America starts now."
Trump gave a 29-minute inaugural address, after which he signed a record-breaking 26 executive orders on his first day in office. Below is a breakdown of some actions Trump will take with the 26 executive orders he signed:
Immigration
Declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border
Will start a mass deportation of what Trump said are "millions and millions of criminal aliens"
Will send U.S. troops to secure the border
Drug cartels will be designated as "foreign terrorist organizations"
Said throughout his campaign he wants to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 which, according to The National Archives, granted the president permission to deport "aliens" and permitted their arrest, imprisonment and deportation during wartime while also restricting free speech critical of the government.
Shut down the CBP One app, which allowed immigrants "to submit advance information and schedule appointments at eight southwest border ports," according to the CBP website.
Drilling
Declare a "national energy emergency" and "drill, baby, drill" to cut inflation
Plans to utilize the U.S.'s oil and gas reserves, claiming that it has the largest amount of any country. Despite that, the U.S. has the largest amount of neither; Venezuela has the most oil reserves, according to the World Atlas and Worldometer, and Russia the most natural gas reserves, according to the World Population Review and Statista
Backing out of the Paris Agreement
Will back out of the Paris Agreement, which aims to combat climate change
