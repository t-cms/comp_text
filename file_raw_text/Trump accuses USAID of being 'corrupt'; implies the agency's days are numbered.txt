 confirmed Tuesday that he will be winding down the, saying the humanitarian agency “had to be corrupt” to approve certain initiatives.
Trump's comments came a day after the White House said more than 600 USAID employees had been put on administrative leave and more than 700 , prompting Democrats to question the legality of the actions.
On Monday, the White House released what it called a list of “pet projects of entrenched bureaucrats” approved by USAID. The list, which the White House described as “ridiculous” and “malicious," included items such as $1.5 million to "advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities"; $70,000 for production of a "DEI musical" in Ireland; $47,000 for a "transgender opera" in Colombia; and $32,000 for a "transgender comic book" in Peru.

“It has to be corrupt. Nobody could approve that,” Trump said Tuesday as he signed  from the White House.
One of Trump’s closest advisors, billionaire tech , who runs the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, disclosed Monday that he and Trump were planning to shut down the agency. Musk has been tasked with helping to slim down the federal bureaucracy.
USAID has been in turmoil as the Trump administration considers folding it into the State Department. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been the agency's acting head since Monday, and Trump said he could see him running it in the long term.
USAID, an independent government agency, oversees around $40 billion a year in spending and was created in 1961.
