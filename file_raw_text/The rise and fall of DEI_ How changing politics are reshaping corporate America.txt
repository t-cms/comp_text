As corporate America grapples with shifting economic pressures and political climates, many companies are scaling back or re-evaluating their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Once celebrated as essential pillars of workplace culture, these programs now face resistance, with some businesses opting to cut back or abandon them entirely. For university students preparing to enter the workforce, this could mean navigating an entirely new landscape.
Where did DEI come from?
Diversity, equity, and inclusion refers to policies and practices aimed at promoting inclusivity and ensuring individuals feel valued. Many organizations, such as schools, government agencies, and corporations, have adopted DEI policies over time.
DEI initiatives in business emerged as a response to societal events. According to Forbes, DEI started in the 1960s following the Civil Rights Act and was implemented in the 1980s. Other sources, like AP News, trace DEI to 2020 after George Floyd's death. For instance, Walmart and Amazon pushed their DEI initiatives in 2020, while companies like Target began in 2023. DEI in business can include employing people from diverse cultural backgrounds, especially minorities, participating in surveys like the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, and setting policies to improve minority customer experiences.
With the re-election of Donald Trump and the continued political debates surrounding race and equality, DEI initiatives are once again under scrutiny. Companies are reconsidering their commitment to diversity and inclusion in light of this political climate.
What's happening to DEI now?
Before Donald Trump's declaration of "justice" against DEI, anti-DEI activists had already emerged.
Robert Starbuck, a 36-year-old former Hollywood music video director and conservative activist, has actively led campaigns against DEI in large corporations. He advocates for a "neutral" corporate America free of social issues. Since June 2024, Starbucks has targeted companies like Tractor Supply and John Deere. Although it's unclear whether Starbucks' campaigns caused the changes, both companies retracted their DEI statements shortly after his efforts.
In Jan. 2025, Trump issued an executive order instructing the federal government to investigate "illegal DEI." The order does not define illegal DEI but refers to it as a "corrosive and pernicious identity-based spoils system."
This action has sparked multiple federal changes and warnings. On Feb. 15, 2025, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights notified all state education departments of required changes within 14 days. Federal agency websites, including those of the Office of Personnel Management, State Department, and Department of Homeland Security, have removed DEI-related documents. Federal DEI staff members have been placed on paid leave, with some sources, such as Time, speculating that they will eventually be terminated.
On the business side, companies like Google, Target, and Amazon have scaled back their DEI initiatives. Google recalled its goal to increase the representation of underrepresented groups. Target ended a program supporting Black-owned businesses and helping Black employees build careers. Amazon announced the winding down of certain programs but did not specify which ones. Other companies, including Lowe's, Meta, McDonald's, and Ford, have made similar changes. While some corporations have publicly committed to maintaining their DEI initiatives, companies like Costco, JPMorgan Chase, and Apple have refused to alter theirs.
University graduates entering the workforce may face a rapidly changing landscape. Staying informed will be crucial for students as they plan their career paths.
What to expect in the future
Despite current challenges, evidence suggests that many corporations will continue to develop their DEI initiatives. More than a third of executives surveyed in Bridge Partners' Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 2024 Barometer stated that the suspension of the US House Office of Diversity would not affect their DEI efforts. Companies continue to prioritize DEI, particularly within human resources and leadership. Although federal actions may impact these initiatives, many corporations plan to pursue DEI strategies moving forward.
Coming from Millersville University student Ahmir Dawson, taking DEI policies into consideration when looking for careers is only a stepping block. Dawson believes it is more about the actual "cultural makeup" of an area than it is about the policies of a business.
"I think it is important to have such policies in the company but not only this, to also integrate a mindset of mutual understanding within the culture of the company, not just regulations and rules." For Dawson, when looking for jobs it's the difference between the "culture of Philadelphia and Lancaster," not which of the two companies has better DEI policies. 
As the workforce continues to evolve, the future of DEI initiatives remains uncertain. For students entering the workforce, staying updated and developing strong personal values will be important.
