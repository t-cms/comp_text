The following information was released by the Cato Institute:
Cato Institute Research Fellow Erec Smith is available for interviews in light of the Trump administration's order placing all federal employees in diversity, equity and inclusion roles on paid administrative leave.
Smith issued the following statement in reaction:
"Accusations of racism are inevitable, but I agree wholeheartedly with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's comment that 'This is another win for Americans of all races.' Contemporary DEI, not to be confused with the colorblind antiracism of the Civil Rights Movement, actually confines minorities, especially Black Americans, to the status of perpetual victims that need the rules changed (i.e., made more lenient) and white Americans disempowered to accommodate for that victimhood. The reality is that most people, including Black Americans, have a much more positive self-regard.
Sadly, the lies or half-truths put forth to defend DEI are still with us. Everett Kelley insists that the federal government already hires on merit, which is a dubious statement. The assessment of government programs that will take place as DEI workers are on paid leave should set the record straight and likely make clear that this is not what the head of the American Federation of Government Employees calls a 'smokescreen for firing civil servants.'"
If you would like to speak with Smith on this issue, please contact me to set up an interview.
Best regards,
EMILY ADAMEC
