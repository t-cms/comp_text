Highlight: Government websites for agencies including the FAA reportedly went dark temporarily as President Trump floated a pause on Friday.
Body


President  suggested a temporary pause on government websites may not be a "bad idea" amid reports of some webpages going dark on Friday.
"I don't know. That doesn't sound like a bad idea to me," Trump said when asked by a reporter whether websites would be paused to scrub them of references to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website appeared to be temporarily offline but had gone back up. Other government websites were still up by publication.
What To Know
Public health data vanished from websites, entire webpages went blank, and employees removed pronouns from email signatures on Friday as federal agencies rushed to comply with a directive linked to Trump's order reversing protections for transgender individuals.
The Office of Personnel Management instructed agency heads in a memo sent on Wednesday to eliminate "gender ideology" from websites, contracts, and emails, mandating that these changes be implemented by 5 p.m. on Friday. The directive also called for agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate related grants and contracts, and replace the term "gender" with "sex" on government forms.
