Highlight: A poll found 53% of British people believe it would be bad if the UK followed the US president’s agenda by diluting commitments to a more inclusive workforce
Body


Britons are split on whether UK business should follow the lead of their US rivals by scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, with a narrow majority opposing any change.
The second Trump presidency has unleashed a backlash to DEI targets and led big US companies to dilute policies and rhetoric. They include recently the US bank Citigroup, whose British group chief executive Jane Fraser told staff last week that the changes came after “developments related to diversity initiatives across all US institutions”.
Polling by Apella Advisors and Find Out Now on the implications of the 
 agenda for UK business found that 53 per cent agreed that it would be “bad” if it led to British companies scaling back their own commitments. Conversely, 22 per cent disagreed that it would be bad, 11 per cent were undecided and a further 14 per cent did not know. 

Opposition was highest among people of working age and especially younger ones. Critics of the initiatives argue that they come at the expense of merit in awarding jobs.
Mike Granleese, head of data and insights at Apella Advisors, said: “For some, that’s because firms would miss out on talent. But the biggest reason for thinking less of firms that junk diversity programmes is that they would be abandoning principles they previously said they held dear. The public values authenticity.”
There was some support, however, for scaling back the commitments: 29 per cent either agreed with or understood the move. Older people and men were more inclined to hold those views. 
“The Trump agenda is not popular among Britons, with most opposing moves by business and politicians to adopt the president’s ideas,” Granleese said. “But that view is not universal and significant parts of UK opinion are positive about Trumpism.”
Trump, 78, has pledged to terminate DEI policies in the federal government and has ended the use of DEI in federal hiring and contracting.
A number of big US companies including Boeing, Ford and Walmart have curbed public support for initiatives.
It emerged last week that the US arm of KPMG had withdrawn from its website 
 that detailed the representation of women and minorities across the organisation. Deloitte, a rival accounting firm, told its US employees this month that it would be 
. 
Meanwhile, Google has removed black, LGBTQ+ and women’s holidays from its digital calendars and Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has scrapped DEI programmes.
Mike Granleese: Brits want business to stand up to Trump on diversity and climate
Like the rest of the world, British business is wondering how to operate in the world of Donald Trump. The US president is pursuing an agenda that leaves many executives considering how they might need to change the way they do business.
Should UK companies abandon commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), as the White House has demanded, or visibly reject the Trump agenda? And what about climate change? Any firm operating in the UK should take account of how the British public thinks about these issues. Polling from Apella Advisors and Find Out Now helps our businesses to understand public opinion on how it should respond to the Trump revolution.
The picture is complicated. The Trump agenda is not popular among Britons: most oppose moves by business and politicians to adopt the president’s ideas, but that view is not universal and significant parts of UK opinion are positive about Trumpism. Any business grappling with these issues should be mindful of this significant minority and its political representatives. 
 
 can be especially tricky. For Trump, firms trying to diversify their staffing are peddling woke politics and discriminating against white men. In the US, Trump’s DEI agenda has legal force — but how should UK firms not subject to American law respond?
A majority of Britons, 53 per cent, think it would be bad if business followed Trump by ditching DEI. For some, that is because firms would miss out on talent. But the biggest reason for thinking less of companies that junk diversity programmes is that they would be abandoning principles they previously said they held dear. The public values authenticity.
 is highest among people of working age and younger ones especially. Among 18 to 54-year-old respondents 57 per cent said it would be “bad” if firms backed away from diversity, but less than half of those aged above 55 think the same. Big recruiters should take note.
Still, there is some support for binning DEI: 29 per cent either agree with or understand the move to scale back on diversity. Older people and men are more inclined to hold these views. These are, of course, the people who are most likely to support Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. Our polling shows that Reform backers are strikingly positive about the Trump agenda in a way that no other voters are.
Climate politics pose different challenges for business. Britons tend to prioritise the environment over economics: 43 per cent want more care for the environment even if it harms economic growth, but only 23 per cent think that economic growth should take priority over the environment. 
That is a warning sign for ministers focusing on growth above all, especially when it comes to their own voters. Labour voters especially are not persuaded by economic growth arguments as a reason to support Donald Trump’s agenda. Only 14 per cent think the UK government needs to do whatever is needed to grow the economy, even if that means supporting Trump’s agenda.
A final result that all executives should heed carefully is what the public thinks is most important for business. For the public, DEI ranks low on the priority list for UK plc. The climate is more important, but still far less significant to the public than how a company treats its workers. The age of Trump raises many new challenges for business but some old truths remain: the best way to build a strong reputation is to be true to your principles and look after your people.
