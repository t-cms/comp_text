LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE": I tell that all of them. All of them have lots to --
CHRIS BEDFORD, POLITICAL COLUMNIST: Damn straight.
INGRAHAM: All right, Chris, great to see you, congratulations.
That's all for us tonight. Make sure to follow me on social media, a lot of reaction to the Bessent and RFK, Jr. interviews, that was fun.
And remember, Jesse Watters, he takes it from here and he always does a great show, so tune in.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, "JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME": Welcome to JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME.
Tonight --
REP. HANK JOHNSON (D-GA): An unelected billionaire can waltz into our agencies and slash and burn the whole thing to the ground like a Taliban terrorist.
WATTERS: DOGE radicalizing Democrats.
PAUL BEGALA, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Who the hell voted Big Balls?
ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. US HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: I have gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic.
God sent me President Trump.
WATTERS: The MAGA Avengers are ready for action.
PAM BONDI, US ATTORNEY GENERAL: Congratulations.
(APPLAUSE)
JON STEWART, "THE DAILY SHOW" HOST: Boy, do the Giants feel like the Democratic Party. Everything that they are doing could not work out. They better clean their (bleep) up.
WATTERS: Someone did not get the memo.
Plus --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy Valentine's Day to all of the beautiful ladies in America.
WATTERS: There has been a break-in at that the IRS. DOGE just kicked in the door and ordered executives to put their hands where they can see them. There was an ultimatum, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: DOGE workers arrived today, Gavin Kliger and others arrived today at the IRS. Do you to expect to close the IRS or what are you expecting?
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I don't expect it. But I mean, so I think that the Internal Revenue Service will be looked at like everybody else, just about everybody is going to be looked at. They are doing a hell of a job. It is an amazing job they are doing.
And you know that force is building, I call it the force of super geniuses, but it is building and you know, they go up and they talked to some of the people about certain deals and the people get all tongue-tied, they can't talk because these people get it. They are very smart people. We need smart people.
WATTERS: Big Balls is making bureaucrats tongue-tied. What is this contract for? Terminated.
Next up is NASA. Elon's nerd army is reviewing their spending. I have a feeling we are going to find NASA isn't all about outer space.
If agencies cannot justify their head count, Musk is planning on slashing every department by 30 to 40 percent. If DOGE finds an unused federal building, they are going to sell it and put the profits in the piggy bank. Trump has his eyes on 14,000 vacant federal buildings.
So if you want to live in 80,000 square-foot estate at the foot of the Potomac that has been collecting cobwebs for six decades, put in a bid.
The government has more money than it knows what to do with. We just found out we're funding Palestinian hip-hop.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. MICHAEL LAWLER (R-NY): I uncovered over $3 million to a rap artist in Gaza, producing anti-Israel, antisemitic songs. Is that the best use of American taxpayer dollars? I would venture not.
WATTERS: And here is who got the money.
(YOUTUBE/RAFFOUL/2014 VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
WATTERS: We sent $3 million to Kanye West Bank, his organization. We are paying Palestinians to rap about the bombs we sold Bibi.
American taxpayers are like bookies, we are on both sides of every deal. We spent $20 billion to freak out a bunch of pets.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. PAUL LOCK, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ENGINEERING PROFESSOR AT JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Injecting puppies with cocaine, staging hamster fight clubs, putting dead turtles on treadmills.
Cats have marbles shoved up their rectums and electro shocked to make them defecate in constipation experiments.
Examining the effects of party drugs on animals injected with testosterone.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Who were rebuying the cocaine from? I can get a gram from Gutfeld and give it to Rookie. What does that cost so much?
I can find a dead turtle in a pond, throw it on a treadmill and hit start and watch it keel over. That's free. A hamster fight club? Did they hire Joe Rogan to announce the fight?
$20 billion is what Trump asked Congress for to build the border wall. We did this instead.
We are also learning through "The New York Post" that the Department of Health and Human Services wasted $22 billion buying migrants cars and homes and giving them seed money to start businesses.
Now, Jose has a Cadillac, a bungalow, a side hustle and a credit score of 740. Did we buy cars and homes for folks in North Carolina after Helene?
And Biden's EPA could not get the money out the door fast enough.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEE ZELDIN, US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago featuring a Biden political appointee talking about how they were tossing gold bars off the Titanic, rushing to get billions of your tax dollars out the door before Inauguration Day.
The gold bars were tax dollars and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden administration knew they were wasting it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Right before Christmas, Biden's EPA gave the Climate United Fund $7 billion. This climate fund looks like a slush fund to funnel cash to Joe's donors for pet projects.
We looked to see who ran the fund and went to the border director's page and they scrubbed it. It is all gone. They took the money and ran. That is why Trump calls it the green new scam.
DOGE is saving over a billion bucks a day chasing this trash down and Democrats are acting like they are getting carpet bombed.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHNSON: What does that mean when an unelected billionaire can waltz into our agencies and slash and burn the whole thing to the ground like a Taliban terrorist?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Only a Democrat would think defunding cocaine puppies is terrorism.
Bill Clinton fired almost 400,000 federal bureaucrats, no one called him a terrorist. They called him Slick Willie. And Trump and Elon are offering very generous buyouts, 75,000 workers have already taken took them up on it. The retirement cave hostages are working 24/7 processing all of this paperwork.
Trump is doing exactly what Obama wished he did.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: One of the commitments that I made to the American people was that we would do a better job here in Washington in rooting out wasteful spending.
We don't need to wait for Congress in order to do something about wasteful spending that is out there.
Cutting waste, making the government more efficient is something that leaders from both parties have worked on.
We have not seen as much action out of Congress as we would like and that is why we launched on our own initiative, the Campaign to Cut Waste.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So Obama said he didn't need to wait for Congress to cut waste, fraud and abuse? That's funny. "The New York Times" has always covered government waste, under Obama, Clinton, Bush -- everybody.
Yesterday, "The Times" reported that the federal government loses between $233 billion to $521 billion a year to fraud. And in the same week, "The Times" writes this headline: Musk asserts without proof that bureaucracy is rife with fraud.
Without proof "The Times" just reported the proof and it is based on the government's own accounting. This is why no one trusts the media.
Finally, Trump hired a rocket scientist with an IT Department to root out the fraud and the Democrats are against it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BEGALA: Who the hell voted for Mr. Musk? Who the hell voted for -- excuse the phrase -- a guy who calls himself, Big Balls?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: No one voted for Musk, so what? No one voted for Fauci either. You voted for the president and he appoints people. And why are we even having this conversation? Trump ran on reform and won on it with Musk at his side and Musk is doing everything under a national spotlight.
He is not hiding in the shadows like Soros financing open borders and crime waves. These people are never going to learn.
After getting humiliated by the Russia hoax, Maddow is back to spreading conspiracies.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Elon Musk has apparently somehow convinced the United States government, specifically the United States Department of State that the taxpayers of the United States of America should spend $400 million buying "armored Tesla production units."
Isn't it great and definitely not at all illegal or profoundly corrupt? Definitely not ripping us all off to pay themselves, right?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Donald Trump did not give that contract to Elon Musk. Joe Biden gave it to him. Even liberals are calling Maddow out. "The $400 million armored Tesla story is a fake scandal any sea of real graft and horror."
And there's a difference between Musk winning competitive bids to provide armored trucks to diplomats in dangerous countries and contracts going to Greek DEI consultants, Caribbean sex change surgeries and oh, hamster cage fights.
Rachel should stick to working Mondays. This five days a week thing is not working out for her.
Teslas are made in America. The State Department asked for them, unlike trans musicals or "Sesame Street" in Iraq, no one asked for that.
Most of the country wants that stuff cut and Democrats should too.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN): People want the government to work better, they believe that Mr. Musk, one of the most extraordinary entrepreneurs in human history, does not fail at just about anything, they want him to do this, most Americans, they wanted Trump, they elected him.
Democrats are only focused on one thing right now, Mr. Musk. The fact of the matter is, he is quite popular, he has the largest platform in human history, which is of course Twitter/X and I think we are missing the boat as Democrats and Democrats are being steamrolled.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: This is not just about money, it is about people behind-the-scenes abusing power they don't have to finance sick and twisted fantasies like migrant shopping sprees and sex changes and reverse racism and injecting narcotics into animals.
DOGE is a blessing from the heavens above. "The Wall Street Journal" puts it this way: "Elon Musk's glorious rampage through official Washington is like something from a dream. Even Ronald Reagan, the great apostle of smaller government could not achieve in eight years what Mr. Musk has done in three-and-a-half weeks. The billionaire businessman is less apostle than avenging angel. The Department of Government Efficiency is the change we have been waiting for."
The Democrats got caught cold in the middle of a bank heist. DOGE walked into the vault, Democrats were stuffing wads of cash in their bags and they are mad that Musk is telling them to put the bags down. The bank robbers are not the victims here, the American taxpayers are.
Kayleigh McEnany is a co-host of "Outnumbered" and former White House press secretary.
Kayleigh, I am having so much fun finding out the fraud. This is a dream come true for a journalist, and I can imagine any conservative or any commonsense American voter to find out what their tax dollars are going to.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST "OUTNUMBERED": Yes, you know, half the time, I'm looking through X, a lot of times you get news on X and I have to wonder, is the fact that documents are stored in a cave an "Onion" headline? Or is this actually something that DOGE found?
And when you have to discern between the two, something is deeply, deeply wrong with your federal government, and Jesse, the freak out is something to behold. I mean, look, you have everyone acknowledging, we have a huge national debt crisis, and you have President Trump -- I remember that prior to President Trump, I'm sure you do to, of Republicans pushing granny off the cliff, pushing her off the cliff because they want to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
Well, President Trump says let's go after the rap ads in Gaza, let's go after the low-hanging fruit and yet the left is freaking out. So they've moved from granny off the cliff towards protecting raps in Gaza? It is profoundly bizarre.
WATTERS: And it's not like this is discriminatory. It's almost like he is going through the departments alphabetically. We are going to get to The Pentagon, we are going to get to -- NASA is already getting audited.
This is not like picking and choosing. Every department is going to get scrutinized and it is almost amazing that we have not seen one single Democrat saying, that rapper in Gaza that hates Jews needs the money.
MCENANY: Right. Instead you have Chuck Schumer wildly throwing around avocados and beer, he did that two weeks ago to make some point about tariffs. And instead, that is what they have to do because you cannot argue with these points.
Jesse, what you laid out, that is inarguable. Every American citizen would say this is a misuse of taxpayer dollars. So there is nothing that they can do accept helplessly flail around grocery store products.
This is a very popular thing and what they're missing is this. Elon Musk is very popular with Gen Z. X is very popular with Gen Z. And when you dig down, Gen Z has said that the number one National Security threat that they face, the millennials have said this, too, is the national debt.
So they look at this, it is very popular and the left simply does not want to do -- does not know what to do.
WATTERS: They are going to have to pay for the baby boomers' retirement and they are not going to be able to afford it because we are going to have to be paying the interest on the debt.
Hamster fight clubs. Do you see any sort of actual benefit? Or am I missing something?
MCENANY: You are missing something. I have a five-year-old and a two-year- old upstairs who keep asking me ad nauseum to play with them, so they benefit from these hamster fight clubs, make it toddler programming instead of PBS and it would go a long way with it.
You know, the only thing I would say is --
WATTERS: But they don't need cocaine, Kayleigh. Why are we giving puppies cocaine? And secondly, where's the cocaine coming from?
MCENANY: Yes, I would love to haul Dr. Anthony Fauci before Congress and ask what he knew about some of these programs and when he knew about it because some of these things I think could only be come up in the mind of a madman.
But Jesse, look, the one point I really do want to make is this, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- President Trump said I am protecting those, I'm going after the hamster fight clubs, I'm going after the cocaine that we are pumping into animals.
He is a mastermind on how to fix a problem without damaging himself and the party politically. This is brilliant what they are doing. Absolutely brilliant, which is why the left is flailing and President Trump has a 53 percent approval rating.
WATTERS: All right, almost as high as yours, Kayleigh. Always good to talk to you.
MCENANY: Almost. Getting there.
WATTERS: Now, go take care of those kids before they fight each other.
MCENANY: Thanks, Jesse.
WATTERS: RFK and Tulsi confirmed. Here is what is coming next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Republicans have been flooding the zone nonstop since Inauguration Day and Democrats are exhausted.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Bannon is right, we are flooded in (bleep) and we are searching for a way to deal with this to ease our extraordinarily difficult times.
We are getting overwhelmed in things that we thought that would kill a political career, that would be poisonous for whatever reason, this guy just keeps chugging along.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Sorry, pace is about to get turned up to 11. Trump's Cabinet is taking shape and they are ready to get to work.
Tulsi Gabbard was sworn in as the Director of National Intelligence. Kash Patel was voted out of committee and RFK, Jr. was just sworn in as Health and Human Services Secretary.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. US HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Our plans are radical transparency and returning gold standard science, the NIH, the FDA, and CDC, ending the corruption, ending the corporate capture of those agencies, getting rid of the people on those panels that have conflicts of interest.
We can do unadored and unimpeded science.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The president also forming a Make America Healthy Again Commission chaired by RFK. The group is going to focus on root causes of America's health crisis. On its agenda, investigating whether electromagnetic radiation causes childhood diseases.
Trump is also making waves in the Mideast. Hamas has suddenly agreed to continue releasing hostages. And coincidentally, Egypt is scrambling to lead the charge to rebuild Gaza so that we don't have to.
And Trump is still putting CNN in their place.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: That's a good one.
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Mr. President, you have won the White House in part because of high inflation. If you're tariffs make prices --
TRUMP: Excuse me, we haven't asked you to speak yet, please, all right? Okay.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Trump met with Indian Prime Minister Modi after releasing a slew of reciprocal tariffs, which means that every country that hits the US with a tariff is going to get slapped back with one at the same rate.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We are going to have a reciprocal tax. Whatever they charge, we charge. If they don't let us in, we are going to determine a value for that, but overall, it is going to be a very simple system. Whatever they charge, we charge so nobody can complain.
If you build here, you have no tariffs whatsoever. I think that is what is going to happen. I think our country is going to be flooded with jobs.
The jobs will go up tremendously, we are going to have great jobs. Jobs for everybody.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Senior counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, Peter Navarro joins us now. How are you doing, Peter?
PETER NAVARRO, SENIOR COUNSEL FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING: Jesse, are you getting tired of winning, brother?
WATTERS: Not yet, I think we have a couple years to go.
What's it like being in the room when Trump shuts down CNN?
NAVARRO: It was fun being in that room for a lot of reasons, but mostly because the president made history. This is the day that the complete restructuring of the international trading system began with the fair and reciprocal plan.
Jesse, it is really simple. The rest of the world cheats us, they steal our jobs, they steal our factories, they damage our defense industrial base, and all of them would steal our National Security.
The president today said no more. And if you would indulge me, I want to tell you a little story about the problem we face.
You take Europe, right? You run a $230 billion trade deficit, much of it in the auto industry. So think about a Cadillac rolling off the assembly line in Lansing, Michigan, going over Bremerhaven and trying to sell into the German markets. A $50,000.00 car when it starts here, it goes over there, they slap a 10 percent tariff on it, which is four times more than our tariff on them.
Then they put the VAT tax on, the value-added tax which acts just like a tariff, it's another 19 percent. So by the time the car kind of gets here, it is $65,000.00. We have to sell it $65,000.
A BMW comes off the assembly line in Leipzig, comes over here, right, we slap a modest 2.5 percent tariff on it, that's about a thousand bucks, so it's up to $51,000.00. But then -- but then, the German government rebates their 19 percent VAT tax, and they are able to sell that BMW for $42,000.00 versus a $65,000.00 Cadillac.
Now, that differential explains why Germany sells us eight times more cars then we sell them and that stuff has got to stop. So what the fair and reciprocal plan does is going to look at every country in the EU, we run a big trade deficit with, we're going to find out exactly how they are cheating us with both tariffs and what the boss calls nonmonetary barriers and then the Secretary of Commerce Lutnick, the great Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer the new USTR, who used to work for the great Bob Lighthizer, and Greer is a force of nature, they are going to determine for the president a reciprocal tariff that captures that unfairness, Jesse, and they are going to put that tariff on where those folks are going to back down and treat America fairly.
It doesn't matter if you are a conservative, or liberal, or Democrat, or Republican, everybody should embrace the fair and reciprocal plan.
WATTERS: I mean even Joe Biden could understand that story you told, Peter, and every American president has the opportunity to do it. Why is Donald Trump the only American president to get this and actually do something about it?
NAVARRO: There are two very simple answers. First, he is a master chess player and he actually understands this. Secondly, what I love about Donald Trump and why in 2016 I immediately reached out and said, hey, need my help, I am here, is that he didn't have to depend on all of the corporate money that wants to send our jobs offshore and open up our borders to cheap labor. He was not bought by anybody.
So what he is doing is good for America. That is his vision and that's why it took so long. We sold this country out, Jesse, you know. We sold this country out for 40 or 50 years with SAFTA and NAFTA and letting China into the World Trade Organization. We run a trillion dollar deficit every year and the trade deficit and that money is then used to buy our factories, to buy our land, to buy our real estate and to buy our farms and all of that stuff. And Donald Trump says that's not going to happen anymore.
So fair trade, fair reciprocal plan and the tariff war is a beautiful thing, reciprocal tariffs as the president said today, is very beautiful.
WATTERS: And it is --
NAVARRO: And before I leave, I want to share -- go ahead.
WATTERS: No, no, I was going to say it is beautiful politically because Democrats can get on board, too.
NAVARRO: Look, this is not a right or left thing or Democrat or Republican, it is an American thing. If you love America then you want jobs here and factories here and a strong defense industrial base so you will be safe, secure and prosperous.
And you know what, Jesse, that's what we had in the first term.
WATTERS: All right, making America great again. Peter Navarro, thank you so much. Great to see you back.
NAVARRO: Thanks for having me.
WATTERS: Democrats, masculinity and money. Right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Democrats want a taste of the Golden Age. A new Gallup poll shows half of Democrats are begging their party to be more moderate. Look at that.
But the politicians are not listening. They're going in further left. They are demanding reparations and forming tans sanctuary cities. That is what we voted against. The liberal leaders are still stuck in the past, way in the past, like the 60s.
Democrats want to feel important like the activists of the Civil Rights era, but big difference. Back then, they had something to fight for and against, but now they don't have a cause so they are just making up problems.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D-IL): You had mentioned trying to engage more women in manufacturing. I'm just wondering if just the name "manufacturing" sounds like a guy. And how can we get more -- certainly there is a lot of room for women.
What are you doing to make that happen?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats only purpose is to resist the guy who won in a landslide and now they are the pro-fraud, pro-waste and pro-criminal party. "The New York Times" -- they are complaining that the criminal illegals in Gitmo are being watched by troops. They are Gitmo. Who do you think works there? Social workers with clipboards? No, these are tough criminals and they need tougher guys keeping them in check.
But "The Times" wants bad hombres to eat five-star meals. Two people with knowledge of the prison operation said the detainees are being fed prepackaged military rations known as MREs or Meals Ready to Eat. MREs are what our troops eat in war zones. Hegseth ate a few in Afghanistan. If it is good for this Defense Secretary, it's good enough for the migrants.
And the last time we gave them a nice meal, they threw it in the trash.
This is why nobody trusts the press. They act like free food is the same as waterboarding. Trump is supposed to be good for ratings, but America is changing the channel on the establishment.
("AUDIBLE"/YOUTUBE VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is it a problem that a significant portion of the country is kind of excluded from your show or late-night television in this way?
JIMMY KIMMEL, "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE" HOST: Is it a problem? I don't know if it is a problem. I think we would have higher ratings if they weren't. But I mean in the grand scheme of things, what is really important is that we have to remind people over and over again that this is not normal and this is not safe and this is not good for any of us.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Cutting fraud and deporting migrants is good for you, too, Kimmel, whether you like it or not. The country loves it.
For the first time in decades, more people say the country is headed in the right direction instead of the wrong direction. That is politically devastating for Democrats and the Republican Party is united. No more runaway RINOs charging into the resistance.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CARVILLE: Some responsible conservative Republicans are going to save us from this, well, they ain't coming. They're not there. Okay, let's just get over it. They are not coming, the cavalry is not coming, the courts are not coming, nothing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Democrats around the field all alone. They might never win another game.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEWART: The New York football Giants have experienced a really interesting year in that we kind of sucked. And (bleep) to bet, and the reason I bring it up is boy, do the Giants feel like the Democratic Party in that the personnel decisions -- everything that they are doing could not work out more humiliatingly.
Boy, they better clean their (bleep) up if they want to compete. Because the ass kicking that has been laid upon them in all aspects, sometimes feels like a permanent state.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The only way for them to pull themselves out of the mud is a little self-reflection. Liberal celebrities are starting to understand why Trump won.
Seth Rogen said this: "People get sick of seeing effing hippies doing acid and effing on their lawns and they're like let's effing clean up these streets a little bit."
When the guy from "Sausage Party" is your voice of reason, you are in trouble. Democrats are stuck on crazy and they will side with the hippie doing acid over their commonsense neighbors just to resist Trump.
But Trump is tearing through the resistance with the help of a rocket scientist. "Trump and Musk, much like they did in the private sector, set their own new limits of authority by stating them emphatically and acting aggressively. Both think conventional polite rule following CEOs and leaders are suckers and conformists. They believe wimps and posers play by the rules, worry about hurt feelings or damaged lives and seek consensus."
AXIOS calls it masculine maximalism. The rest of it call it being a leader.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLAY TRAVIS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Men aspire to be bigger, stronger and faster than we are, almost universally. That is why superheroes are popular, that's why pro athletes are popular.
Who is the most masculine Democrat right now in America? Mayor Pete?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But Trump is like a grandfather.
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. Trump took a bullet in his ear and immediately stood up and said "fight, fight, fight." Every man in America and most of the women out here were impressed by that, even if the women won't admit it. She is shaking her head, she is wrong.
And the second part of this, basically summing it up, Democrats for men are (bleep) and Republicans aren't.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democrats for men.
TRAVIS: Are (bleep). There are no masculine men in the Democratic Party right now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Tomi Lahren is an Outkick.com host and host of "100 Days" with Tomi Lahren on Fox Nation.
Can you name any masculine man in the Democratic Party?
TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: They/them perhaps. A man, not so much. I think the most masculine folks on the Democratic Party are probably women and I heard today that they are considering Jasmine Crockett for 2028. So if that is the case, we are in for a real treat.
WATTERS: Not related to Davy, just to clear it up.
LAHREN: You know, Democrats -- no. Davy would be rolling in his grave if you made that assertion about him and the Crockett name.
But listen, Democrats are flailing because nothing that they have is popular. They are going back to the drawing board every time and they are thinking, okay, this is 2020, we are going to have men in women's sports, we are going to be looting and rioting in the streets for George Floyd, they are thinking gender mutilation and puberty blockers, we will go with that one and then every single time, they are swatted back, they realize, 70 percent of Americans want women's sports for women, we don't believe in purity blockers and mutilation for children. We don't believe in over taxation and regulation, we don't want to pay for Kanye West Bank's new rap album.
So they keep going back and are like the hill we are going to die on, guys is waste, fraud, and abuse. They would be better off going back to men in women's sports because that is how popular waste, fraud, and abuse is, but they don't get it because they are not the party of the working man and woman anymore.
WATTERS: Did you, when you were in college growing up, want to go into the manufacturing sector but got scared of the man factor of manufacturing so you went into TV instead?
LAHREN: I don't know people look at me and immediately think manual labor. I certainly don't. It wasn't --
WATTERS: You're not good with a shovel?
LAHREN: No. It wasn't the manufacturing part of it that turned me away. But again, they are going back to the words and how words make people feel and the trans sanctuary cities and they look like clowns in a circus. They have a chorus of people standing up singing songs about Elon Musk.
They look insane, they act insane, and they wonder why Americans are not getting behind that. We may never lose an election again.
WATTERS: Stewart and some of the others touched on it. They keep waiting for someone to save them, whether it is the media, whether it is a runaway prosecutor, whether it is some moderate Republican that is just going to throw the Senate out the window.
I don't think the cavalry is coming.
LAHREN: When Mitch McConnell was your saving grace, right, when he is the only one that is with you, you've got a real problem. I don't want to give Democrats any secrets, but if they wanted to do better in the midterms and in 2028, they'd go with somebody like Dean Phillips how is saying listen, you guys are way off track. But they won't do that because they are married to woke and they only spend time around woke people that think like they do, so they are leaving out the rest of America.
The rest of America is going to keep voting Republican, especially at this pace of Donald Trump and Elon Musk cutting waste, fraud and abuse. They don't want to pay for Kanye West Bank, they don't want to pay for condoms in Gaza or Mozambique, they just want to support their families and they want the illegal immigrants to be deported.
WATTERS: Fetterman-Phillips probably a better ticket than whatever the last ticket was with Kamala Harris and Walz.
LAHREN: Kamala is done. Her political career is over. Joe Biden, we might never see or hear from him again. They don't have a leader, they're desperately searching for one and Jasmine Crockett is the best that they have? Oh Good Lord.
WATTERS: Oh, my gosh. Could we please pray they nominate Jasmine Crockett, that would just -- I didn't think it would be getting any better to cover this guy. If we could have a Republican run against Crockett, that would be my dream come true.
Tomi Lahren, who you will see on many programs throughout the Fox News platform in the next 48 hours.
Thank you, Tomi.
LAHREN: Thanks, Jesse.
WATTERS: Happy Valentine's Day.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
