What Joe Biden did was tell the American public that he would never pardon his son. His son gets convicted, and then he pardons him, but then he goes and pardons his entire family in the last minutes, not telling the incoming president. But what's so ironic, to me, terrible about this. These are the people he was in business with. This is what everybody wondered, the Big Guy. This is where China sent their money. This is where they had so many LLCs and when one money came into one, they went around and put cash and he denied it the entire time.

\ulnone\cf2  is better prepared to do this job now than at any time in his life. Because first of all, when he went in in the first, true, he had never been elected before. He listened to people that didn't give him good advice. He only has four more years to go. But now he knows the job. He is kind of like Malcolm Baldwin. He's got the 10,000 hours. But what was even better, and it might -- and it was tough, he left the White House, because what happens? You get isolated in there. You don't get to see the American public. He goes out and no one would ever have to go through the battle that he did to win -- assassination attempts, persecution, trying to put him in jail. He had to fight so hard, but he sat with the American public. He knows what's going on, and the world sits in a different place. China is a different situation. Russia is in a different situation. He's prepared now, and he's fearless, and he knows he has four years to go. He's not going to waste one minute. He's going to go faster than the House and the Senate will be able to keep up. WATTERS: It would be like if I got fired from Fox, took four years off, reclaimed my position. Imagine how good I would be. Could you imagine? Not that I want to get fired, but could you imagine K-Mac? Wow. MCCARTHY: It's hard to imagine you even being better. But you know what? Constant improvement and knowledge matters. And you know, it kind of humbled this president, and think about the attack, the assassination attempt, that changes you. And you know what? It's for the better that he spent this time with the American public. WATTERS: Completely. MCCARTHY: And he's not going to let bad advice push him in the wrong way. WATTERS: All right, K-Mac, still recovering from the Inaugural Balls. He went to all of them twice. See you later. MCCARTHY: And you never once asked me to dance. WATTERS: A former Obama foot soldier comes clean. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: In his final act as president, Joe Biden pardoned Fauci. The pardons backdated to 2014, which was when Obama prohibited Fauci from funding gain-of-function research. Then a virus escapes from a lab that Fauci was illegally funding, kills a million Americans. Biden tanks the investigation and preemptively pardons the Fauchmeister. Then he pardons his entire family, also back dates them to 2014, which was when Hunter started flying all over the world selling access to his Pop. Did Fauci and the Biden family lobby the Big Guy for the pardon? Did money exchange hands? We're about to find out. And right after we uncovered that the FBI and government informants embedded in Jan 6, and that the Jan 6 Committee destroyed evidence, Biden pardons every Democrat on the committee, plus Cheney and Kinzinger. Speaker Johnson, says he's going to investigate the Biden pardon scandal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHNSON: What President Biden did on the way out, pardoning his family for more than a decade of whatever activity, any nonviolent offenses. It was -- it was breathtaking to us. It is disgusting to us. It probably proves the point, the suspicion that, you know, they call it the Biden crime family. If they aren't the crime family, why do they need pardons, right? Look, there's a lot of attention that's going to be paid to this, and I think that is appropriate, and we will be looking at it as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Long time Biden friends are revolted. Bill Daley, who was Obama's White House chief-of-staff says, "It's disgusting. It confirms that there are serious concerns about culpability." Daley said, "The Bidens will never wipe the stain from the former president's legacy." Preemptive pardons are shady as hell. Your people can abuse power and get preemptive pardons in the final seconds? A DC cop who testified to the J6 committee, he got a pardon. Why is Biden giving preemptive pardons to Capitol Hill Police who are on the scene on Jan 6? This officer is like, "Don't pull me into your cover up." (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL HODGES, D.C. POLICE OFFICER ASSAULTED IN JANUARY 6TH ATTACK: I'm disinclined to accept it, because I haven't committed any crimes. I haven't done anything wrong, and to accept, I know, legally, it's debatable, but in my mind, accepting a pardon is an admission of guilt. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: You don't want it? (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Not too long ago, Biden agreed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: Have you ruled out a pardon for yourself or any other additional members of the family? JOE BIDEN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself? REPORTER: Yes, sir. BIDEN: What would I pardon myself for? REPORTER: That's what I'm asking. BIDEN: No, I have no contemplation of pardoning myself. Anyway, I didn't do anything wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: So did your family and Fauci do something wrong? Because they're innocent until proven guilty, but you're stepping in and killing due process and putting them above the law, kind of sounds like a dictator. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Joe Biden ran and said he would never do preemptive pardons. It was an issue that came up when you were leaving in your first term. }

And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon and if you look at it, it all had to do with him.

VIETOR: Sure. WATTERS: And now he doesn't have a library. VIETOR: Let's talk about the pardons for a minute. WATTERS: Sure. VIETOR: I think Joe Biden's decision to pardon his family sends a terrible message to the world. I think the presidential pardon power is far too expansive. I would love to see Congress come together and pass a constitutional amendment that says you cannot pardon yourself, you can't pardon your family, you can't pardon your staff. I think all your listeners would support that. WATTERS: Why did he pardon his family preemptively? VIETOR: But I also think it sends a terrible message to pardon people who beat the crap out of police officers on live TV. WATTERS: Yes. They were overcharged.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Fox News Alert: The largest mass deportation operation in the US history has begun. PRIMETIME got its hands on exclusive photos of ICE raids from across the country. In New York, ICE arrested El Salvadorian illegal Jose Roberto Rodriguez, with ties to MS-13. In Miami, six Guatemalan illegals were captured. All of them had lengthy rap sheets, including battery, child abuse, fraud, DUI, trespassing, and vandalism. In Baltimore, ICE arrested Miguel Ramirez Fajardo, a Mexican national who illegally entered the United States, His only crime breaking into the country that we know of. And in New York, again, ICE nabbed Camaro Denver Hay (ph) , a Jamaican who was previously arrested for possession of child porn. These are just some of the hundreds of illegals that ICE apprehended in the last few days. South America, Africa, the Middle East, these guys are from all over, and they are some of the most violent criminals you can think of -- homicide, sex, assault, smuggling, kidnapping, robbery, battery, drugs, and weapons offenses. This is all happening as The Pentagon sending 1,500 troops to the southern border. And it's not just ground operations. The Coast Guard is moving vessels south. Some going to the Gulf of America. For four years, we were told that Biden couldn't fix the border crisis through executive action, and yet, there }

\ulnone\cf2  is reinstating the remain- in-Mexico policy, killing Biden's border app, erasing catch-and-release and designating cartels terrorist organizations. Biden had banned ICE agents from arresting illegals in what he called sensitive areas. These sensitive areas included schools, hospitals, places of worship, any place where children gather, social service centers, disaster areas, funerals, weddings, protests and parades. A criminal alien could be serving fries at your daughter's school cafeteria, and ICE wouldn't be able to go in and get them. A migrant sex trafficker could be luring little girls into his van at a playground, and ICE couldn't touch him. If El Chapo himself was roaming around the Pacific Palisades, ICE would have to leave him alone, because it's a disaster area. A Biden migrant gun trafficker attending the wedding of a Venezuelan national in New Jersey, ICE couldn't grab him. ICE couldn't grab either of them. ICE couldn't even slap handcuffs on them at the cocktail hour or at the reception, because that's technically still the wedding. Even if a Biden migrant stormed the Capitol on January 6, sorry, it's a protest, ICE isn't allowed to arrest him. Biden created sanctuaries within sanctuaries, mini sanctuaries, but }

And this just in, if local or state politicians try to interfere with mass deportations, Pam Bondi is going to put them under investigation. Deputy Chief-of-Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Adviser, Stephen Miller joins us now. So this big sweep nabbed a couple of bad guys. What's next? STEPHEN MILLER, DEPUTY CHIEF-OF-STAFF OR POLICY AND HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: Yes, well, as you mentioned, Jesse, the initial immigration raids have already arrested and removed some of the most vicious criminals in this country, including child pornography cases, homicide cases, sexual assault, attacks on children, and this is just the very beginning in the effort to liberate this country from the migrant criminal threat. In the coming days, you're going to see a massive scale up in enforcement activities all across the country to dismantle these criminal networks. And not only is it going to be ICE engaging these raids, but also they're going to have support from their law enforcement partners in FBI, ATF, DEA and US Marshals. We're going to leverage the full power of federal law enforcement at President }

\ulnone\cf2 's command and direction to save this country from this occupation. You're also going to see, as you mentioned, the Department of Justice pursuing civil and, if necessary, criminal charges against anybody who shelters or harbors criminal aliens, that includes individuals in sanctuary cities who are harboring violent and dangerous criminals from federal law enforcement. The tables have turned, and now those who protect criminal aliens are going to face the legal consequences that exist in statute. And at the border, as you mentioned, the military is enroute. They are mobilizing active duty National Guard, as well as a massive effort to engage in military construction along the southern border to impede and deny the entry of illegal aliens and to send anyone who crosses home, or if they've engaged in criminal activity, we also may face -- they also may face significant criminal prosecution. So every instrument, every lever of federal power, is being deployed to crush the cartels, dismantle the gangs, seal off the border, halt the invasion, and send the illegals home. WATTERS: So Miller, if Mayor Bass, Mayor Johnson, if they blockade ICE from going in, if they sabotage the mass deportation efforts, they could be arrested. MILLER: The law is clear that harboring any legal alien, smuggling any illegal alien, obstructing law enforcement, obstructing an official proceeding and a conspiracy to violate the rights of Americans -- all of these and many more are criminal statutes. And so if there is incidences that occur where a public official or an elected individual engages in violations of those criminal statutes, then I fully expect the Department of Justice will follow the letter of the law, because, as I'm sure you know, Jesse, no one is above the law, not illegal aliens, and not anyone who may choose to illegally harbor those aliens. So this is a warning to anybody who is trying to obstruct ICE enforcement activity, if your obstruction violates federal law, then you face criminal jeopardy. So again, this is just applying the plain letter of the law, inducing, harboring, smuggling, trafficking -- these are all crimes. This is also another message to people who are trafficking children. Child trafficking is a 20-year prison sentence. You traffic a child, you are going to be in jail for a long time, and Pam Bondi's Justice Department is going to see to it. And I will also say, with respect to sanctuary cities overall, they are going to be flooded by federal law enforcement to find and remove these criminal threats.

I really do think that he said something disparaging about the fact that he has disparaged his father for so many years, and now he is getting back at him. There was nothing kind that was said in that little -- WATTERS: I mean, whatever he said, Biden actually heard it, and he's very hard of hearing.
